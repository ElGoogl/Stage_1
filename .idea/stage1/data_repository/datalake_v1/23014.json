(He was known simply as \"The Soldier,\" and it is probable\r\nthat there was not a man or woman, and certain that there was not a\r\nchild in the Quarter who did not know him: the tall, erect old Sergeant\r\nwith his white, carefully waxed moustache, and his face seamed with two\r\nsabre cuts. One of these cuts, all knew, had been received the summer\r\nday when he had stood, a mere boy, in the hollow square at Waterloo,\r\nstriving to stay the fierce flood of the \"men on the white horses\"; the\r\nother, tradition said, was of even more ancient date.)\r\n\r\nYes, they all knew him, and knew how when he was not over thirteen, just\r\nthe age of little Raoul the humpback, who was not as tall as Pauline, he\r\nhad received the cross which he always wore over his heart sewed in the\r\nbreast of his coat, from the hand of the emperor himself, for standing\r\non the hill at Wagram when his regiment broke, and beating the\r\nlong-roll, whilst he held the tattered colors resting in his arm, until\r\nthe men rallied and swept back the left wing of the enemy. This the\r\nchildren knew, as their fathers and mothers and grandfathers and\r\ngrandmothers before them had known it, and rarely an evening passed that\r\nsome of the gamins were not to be found in the old man's kitchen,\r\nwhich was also his parlor, or else on his little porch, listening with\r\never-new delight to the story of his battles and of the emperor. They\r\nall knew as well as he the thrilling part where the emperor dashed by\r\n(the old Sergeant always rose reverently at the name, and the little\r\naudience also stood,--one or two nervous younger ones sometimes bobbing\r\nup a little ahead of time, but sitting down again in confusion under\r\nthe contemptuous scowls and pluckings of the rest),--where the emperor\r\ndashed by, and reined up to ask an officer what regiment that was\r\nthat had broken, and who was that drummer that had been promoted\r\nto ensign;--they all knew how, on the grand review afterwards, the\r\nSergeant, beating his drum with one hand (while the other, which had\r\nbeen broken by a bullet, was in a sling), had marched with his company\r\nbefore the emperor, and had been recognized by him. They knew how he had\r\nbeen called up by a staff-officer (whom the children imagined to be\r\na fine gentleman with a rich uniform, and a great shako like Marie's\r\nuncle, the drum-major), and how the emperor had taken from his own\r\nbreast and with his own hand had given him the cross, which he had never\r\nfrom that day removed from his heart, and had said, \"I would make you a\r\ncolonel if I could spare you.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the story they liked best, though there were many others which\r\nthey frequently begged to be told--of march and siege and battle, of\r\nvictories over or escapes from red-coated Britishers and fierce German\r\nlancers, and of how the mere presence of the emperor was worth fifty\r\nthousand men, and how the soldiers knew that where he was no enemy could\r\nwithstand them. It all seemed to them very long ago, and the soldier of\r\nthe empire was the only man in the Quarter who was felt to be greater\r\nthan the rich nobles and fine officers who flashed along the great\r\nstreets, or glittered through the boulevards and parks outside. More\r\nthan once when Paris was stirred up, and the Quarter seemed on the eve\r\nof an outbreak, a mounted orderly had galloped up to his door with\r\na letter, requesting his presence somewhere (it was whispered at the\r\nprefect's), and when he returned, if he refused to speak of his visit\r\nthe Quarter was satisfied; it trusted him and knew that when he advised\r\nquiet it was for its good. He loved France first, the Quarter next. Had\r\nhe not been offered--? What had he not been offered! The Quarter knew,\r\nor fancied it knew, which did quite as well. At least, it knew how he\r\nalways took sides with the Quarter against oppression. It knew how he\r\nhad gone up into the burning tenement and brought the children down out\r\nof the garret just before the roof fell. It knew how he had jumped into\r\nthe river that winter when it was full of ice, to save Raoul's little\r\nlame dog which had fallen into the water; it knew how he had reported\r\nthe gendarmes for arresting poor little Aimee just for begging a man in\r\nthe Place de L'Opera for a franc for her old grandmother, who was blind,\r\nand how he had her released instead of being sent to ------. But what\r\nwas the need of multiplying instances! He was \"the Sergeant,\" a soldier\r\nof the empire, and there was not a dog in the Quarter which did not feel\r\nand look proud when it could trot on the inside of the sidewalk by him.\r\n\r\nThus the old Sergeant came to be regarded as the conservator of order in\r\nthe Quarter, and was worth more in the way of keeping it quiet than all\r\nthe gendarmes that ever came inside its precincts. And thus the children\r\nall knew him.\r\n\r\nOne story that the Sergeant sometimes told, the girls liked to hear,\r\nthough the boys did not, because it had nothing about war in it, and\r\nMinette and Clarisse used to cry so when it was told, that the Sergeant\r\nwould stop and put his arms around them and pet them until they only\r\nsobbed on his shoulder.\r\n\r\nIt was of how he had, when a lonely old man, met down in Lorraine his\r\nlittle Camille, whose eyes were as blue as the sky, and her hand as\r\nwhite as the flower from which she took her name, and her cheeks as pink\r\nas the roses in the gardens of the Tuileries. He had loved her, and she,\r\nthough forty years his junior, had married him and had come here to live\r\nwith him; but the close walls of the city had not suited her, and she\r\nhad pined and languished before his eyes like a plucked lily, and, after\r\nshe bore him Pierre, had died in his arms, and left him lonelier than\r\nbefore. And the old soldier always lowered his voice and paused a moment\r\n(Raoul said he was saying a mass), and then he would add consolingly:\r\n\"But she left a soldier, and when I am gone, should France ever need\r\none, Pierre will be here.\" The boys did not fancy this story for the\r\nreasons given, and besides, although they loved the Sergeant, they did\r\nnot like Pierre. Pierre was not popular in the Quarter,--except with the\r\nyoung girls and a few special friends. The women said he was idle and\r\nvain like his mother, who had been, they said, a silly lazy thing with\r\nlittle to boast of but blue eyes and a white skin, of which she was too\r\nproud to endanger it by work, and that she had married the Sergeant for\r\nhis pension, and would have ruined him if she had lived, and that Pierre\r\nwas just like her.\r\n\r\nThe children knew nothing of the resemblance. They disliked Pierre\r\nbecause he was cross and disagreeable to them, and however their older\r\nsisters might admire his curling brown hair, his dark eyes, and delicate\r\nfeatures, which he had likewise inherited from his mother, they did not\r\nlike him; for he always scolded when he came home and found them there;\r\nand he had several times ordered the whole lot out of the house; and\r\nonce he had slapped little Raoul, for which Jean Maison had beaten him.\r\nOf late, too, when it drew near the hour for him to come home, the old\r\nSergeant had two or three times left out a part of his story, and had\r\ntold them to run away and come back in the morning, as Pierre liked to\r\nbe quiet when he came from his work--which Raoul said was gambling.\r\n\r\nThus it was that Pierre was not popular in the Quarter.\r\n\r\nHe was nineteen years old when war was declared.\r\n\r\nThey said Prussia was trying to rob France,--to steal Alsace and\r\nLorraine. All Paris was in an uproar. The Quarter, always ripe for any\r\nexcitement, shared in and enjoyed the general commotion. It struck off\r\nfrom work. It was like the commune; at least, so people said. Pierre was\r\nthe loudest declaimer in the district. He got work in the armory.\r\n\r\nRecruiting officers went in and out of the saloons and cafes, drinking\r\nwith the men, talking to the women, and stirring up as much fervor as\r\npossible. It needed little to stir it. The Quarter was seething. Troops\r\nwere being mustered in, and the streets and parks were filled with the\r\ntramp of regiments; and the roll of the drums, the call of the bugles,\r\nand the cheers of the crowds as they marched by floated into the\r\nQuarter. Brass bands were so common that although in the winter a couple\r\nof strolling musicians had been sufficient to lose temporarily every\r\nchild in the Quarter, it now required a full band and a grenadier\r\nregiment, to boot, to draw a tolerable representation.\r\n\r\nOf all the residents of the Quarter, none took a deeper interest than\r\nthe soldier of the empire. He became at once an object of more than\r\nusual attention. He had married in Lorraine, and could, of course, tell\r\njust how long it would take to whip the Prussians. He thought a single\r\nbattle would decide it. It would if the emperor were there. His little\r\ncourt was always full of inquirers, and the stories of the emperor were\r\ntold to audiences now of grandfathers and grandmothers.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice the gendarmes had sauntered down, thinking, from seeing\r\nthe crowd, that a fight was going on. They had stayed to hear of the\r\nemperor. A hint was dropped by the soldier of the empire that perhaps\r\nFrance would conquer Prussia, and then go on across to Moscow to settle\r\nan old score, and that night it was circulated through the Quarter that\r\nthe invasion of Russia would follow the capture of Berlin. The emperor\r\nbecame more popular than he had been since the _coup d'etat_. Half the\r\nQuarter offered its services.\r\n\r\nThe troops were being drilled night and day, and morning after morning\r\nthe soldier of the empire locked his door, buttoned his coat tightly\r\naround him, and with a stately military air marched over to the park to\r\nsee the drill, where he remained until it was time for Pierre to have\r\nhis supper.\r\n\r\nThe old Sergeant's acquaintance extended far beyond the Quarter. Indeed,\r\nhis name had been mentioned in the papers more than once, and his\r\npresence was noted at the drill by those high in authority; so that he\r\nwas often to be seen surrounded by a group listening to his accounts of\r\nthe emperor, or showing what the _manuel_ had been in his time. His air,\r\nalways soldierly, was now imposing, and many a visitor of distinction\r\ninquiring who he might be, and learning that he was a soldier of the\r\nempire, sought an introduction to him. Sometimes they told him that they\r\ncould hardly believe him so old, could hardly believe him much older\r\nthan some of those in the ranks, and although at first he used to\r\ndeclare he was like a rusty flint-lock, too old and useless for service,\r\ntheir flattery soothed his vanity, and after a while, instead of shaking\r\nhis head and replying as he did at first that France had no use for old\r\nmen, he would smile doubtfully and say that when they let Pierre go,\r\nmaybe he would go too, \"just to show the children how they fought then.\"\r\n\r\nThe summer came. The war began in earnest. The troops were sent to the\r\nfront, the crowds shouting, \"On to Berlin.\" Others were mustered in\r\nand sent after them as fast as they were equipped. News of battle\r\nafter battle came; at first, of victory (so the papers said), full and\r\nsatisfying, then meagre and uncertain, and at last so scanty that only\r\nthe wise ones knew there had been a defeat. The Quarter was in a fever\r\nof patriotism.\r\n\r\nJean Maison and nearly all the young men had enlisted and gone, leaving\r\ntheir sweethearts by turns waving their kerchiefs and wiping their\r\neyes with them. Pierre, however, still remained behind. He said he was\r\nworking for the Government. Raoul said he was not working at all; that\r\nhe was skulking.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the levy came. Pierre was conscripted.\r\n\r\nThat night the Sergeant enlisted in the same company. Before the week\r\nwas out, their regiment was equipped and dispatched to the front, for\r\nthe news came that the army was making no advance, and it was said that\r\nFrance needed more men. Some shook their heads and said that was not\r\nwhat she needed, that what she needed was better officers. A suggestion\r\nof this by some of the recruits in the old Sergeant's presence drew from\r\nhim the rebuke that in his day \"such a speech would have called out a\r\ncorporal and a file of grenadiers.\"\r\n\r\nThe day they were mustered in, the captain of the company sent for him\r\nand bade him have the first sergeant's chevrons sewed on his sleeve. The\r\norder had come from the colonel, some even said from the marshal. In\r\nthe Quarter it was said that it came from the emperor. The Sergeant\r\nsuggested that Pierre was the man for the place; but the captain simply\r\nrepeated the order. The Quarter approved the selection, and several\r\nfights occurred among the children who had gotten up a company as to\r\nwho should be the sergeant. It was deemed more honorable than to be the\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\nThe day the regiment left Paris, the Sergeant was ordered to report\r\nseveral reliable men for special duty; he detailed Pierre among the\r\nnumber. Pierre was sick, so sick that when the company started he would\r\nhave been left behind but for his father. The old soldier was too proud\r\nof his son to allow him to miss the opportunity of fighting for France.\r\nPierre was the handsomest man in the regiment.\r\n\r\nThe new levies on arrival in the field went into camp, in and near some\r\nvillages and were drilled,--quite needlessly, Pierre and some of the\r\nothers declared. They were not accustomed to restraint, and they could\r\nnot see why they should be worked to death when they were lying in camp\r\ndoing nothing. But the soldier of the empire was a strict drill-master,\r\nand the company was shortly the best-drilled one in the regiment.\r\n\r\nYet the army lay still: they were not marching on to Berlin. The sole\r\nprinciple of the campaign seemed to be the massing together of as many\r\ntroops as possible. What they were to do no one appeared very clearly to\r\nknow. What they were doing all knew: they were doing nothing. The men,\r\nat first burning for battle, became cold or lukewarm with waiting;\r\ndissatisfaction crept in, and then murmurs: \"Why did they not fight?\"\r\nThe soldier of the empire himself was sorely puzzled. The art of war had\r\nclearly changed since his day. The emperor would have picked the best\r\nthird of these troops and have been at the gates of the Prussian capital\r\nin less time than they had spent camped with the enemy right before\r\nthem. Still, it was not for a soldier to question, and he reported for\r\na week's extra guard duty a man who ventured to complain in his presence\r\nthat the marshal knew as little as the men. Extra guard duty did no\r\ngood. The army was losing heart.\r\n\r\nThus it was for several weeks. But at last, one evening, it was apparent\r\nthat some change was at hand: the army stirred and shook itself as a\r\ngreat animal moves and stretches, not knowing if it will awake or drop\r\noff to sleep again.\r\n\r\nDuring the night it became wide awake. It was high time. The Prussians\r\nwere almost on them. They had them in a trap. They held the higher\r\ngrounds and hemmed the French in. All night long the tents were being\r\nstruck, and the army was in commotion. No one knew just why it was. Some\r\nsaid they were about to be attacked; some said they were surrounded.\r\nUncertainty gave place to excitement. At length they marched.\r\n\r\nWhen day began to break, the army had been tumbled into line of battle,\r\nand the regiment in which the old Sergeant and Pierre were was drawn\r\nup on the edge of a gentleman's park outside of the villages. The line\r\nextended beyond them farther than they could see, and large bodies of\r\ntroops were massed behind them, and were marching and countermarching\r\nin clouds of dust. The rumor went along the ranks that they were in\r\nthe advanced line, and that the Germans were just the other side of\r\nthe little plateau, which they could dimly see in the gray light of the\r\ndawn. The men, having been marching in the dark, were tired, and most\r\nof them lay down, when they were halted, to rest. Some went to sleep;\r\nothers, like Pierre, set to work and with their bayonets dug little\r\ntrenches and threw up a slight earthwork before them, behind which they\r\ncould lie; for the skirmishers had been thrown out, looking vague and\r\nghostly as they trotted forward in the dim twilight, and they supposed\r\nthat the battle would be fought right there. By the time, however, that\r\nthe trenches were dug, the line was advanced, and the regiment was moved\r\nforward some distance, and was halted just under a knoll along which ran\r\na road. The Sergeant was the youngest man in the company; the sound of\r\nbattle had brought back all his fire. To him numbers were nothing. He\r\nthought it now but a matter of a few hours, and France would be at the\r\ngates of Berlin. He saw once more the field of glory and heard again\r\nthe shout of victory; Lorraine would be saved; he beheld the tricolor\r\nfloating over the capital of the enemies of France. Perhaps, it would be\r\nplanted there by Pierre. And he saw in his imagination Pierre climbing\r\nat a stride from a private to a captain, a colonel, a--! who could\r\ntell?--had not the _baton_ been won in a campaign? As to dreaming that a\r\nbattle could bring any other result than victory!--It was impossible!\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going?\" shouted derisively the men of a regiment at rest,\r\nto the Sergeant's command as they marched past.\r\n\r\n\"To Berlin,\" replied the Sergeant.\r\n\r\nThe reply evoked cheers, and that regiment that day stood its ground\r\nuntil a fourth of its men fell. The old soldier's enthusiasm infected\r\nthe new recruits, who were pale and nervous under the strain of waiting.\r\nHis eye rested on Pierre, who was standing down near the other end of\r\nthe company, and the father's face beamed as he thought he saw there\r\nresolution and impatience for the fight. Ha! France should ring with his\r\nname; the Quarter should go wild with delight.\r\n\r\nJust then the skirmishers ahead began to fire, and in a few moments it\r\nwas answered by a sullen note from the villages beyond the plain, and\r\nthe battle had begun. The dropping fire of the skirmish line increased\r\nand merged into a rattle, and suddenly the thunder broke from a hill\r\nto their right, and ran along the crest until the earth trembled under\r\ntheir feet. Bullets began to whistle over their heads and clip the\r\nleaves of the trees beyond them, and the long, pulsating scream of\r\nshells flying over them and exploding in the park behind them made the\r\nfaces of the men look gray in the morning twilight. Waiting was worse\r\nthan fighting. It told on the young men.\r\n\r\nIn a little while a staff-officer galloped up to the colonel, who was\r\nsitting on his horse in the road, quietly smoking a cigar, and a moment\r\nlater the whole line was in motion. They were wheeled to the right, and\r\nmarched under shelter of the knoll in the direction of the firing. As\r\nthey passed the turn of the road, they caught a glimpse of the hill\r\nahead where the artillery, enveloped in smoke, was thundering from an\r\never-thickening cloud. A battery of eight guns galloped past them, and\r\nturning the curve disappeared in a cloud of dust. To the new recruits it\r\nseemed as if the whole battle was being fought right there. They could\r\nsee nothing but their own line, and only a part of that; smoke and dust\r\nhid everything else; but the hill was plainly an important point, for\r\nthey were being pushed forward, and the firing on the rise ahead of them\r\nwas terrific. They were still partly protected by the ridge, but shells\r\nwere screaming over them, and the earth was rocking under their feet.\r\nMore batteries came thundering by,--the men clinging to the pieces and\r\nthe drivers lashing their horses furiously,--and disappearing into\r\nthe smoke on the hill, unlimbered and swelled the deafening roar; they\r\npassed men lying on the ground dead or wounded, or were passed by others\r\nhelping wounded comrades to the rear. Several men in the company fell,\r\nsome crying out or groaning with pain, and two or three killed outright.\r\n\r\nThe men were dodging and twisting, with heads bent forward a little as\r\nif in a pelting rain. Only the old Sergeant and some of the younger ones\r\nwere perfectly erect.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you dodge the balls?\" asked a recruit of the Sergeant.\r\n\r\n\"A soldier of the empire never dodges,\" was the proud reply.\r\n\r\nSome change occurred on the hills; they could not see what. Just then\r\nthe order came down the line to advance at a double-quick and support\r\nthe batteries. They moved forward at a run and passed beyond the shelter\r\nof the ridge. Instantly they were in the line of fire from the Prussian\r\nbatteries, whose white puffs of smoke were visible across the plain, and\r\nbullets and shell tore wide spaces in their ranks. They could not see\r\nthe infantrymen, who were in pits, but the bullets hissed and whistled\r\nby them. The men on both sides of Pierre were killed and fell forward on\r\ntheir faces with a thud, one of them still clutching his musket. Pierre\r\nwould have stopped, but there was no time, the men in the rear pressed\r\nhim on. As they appeared in the smoke of the nearest battery, the\r\nartillerymen broke into cheers at the welcome sight, and all down the\r\nline it was taken up. All around were dead and dying men increasing in\r\nnumbers momentarily. No one had time to notice them. Some of them had\r\nblankets thrown over them. The infantry, who were a little to the side\r\nof the batteries, were ordered to lie down; most of them had already\r\ndone so; even then they were barely protected; shot and shell ploughed\r\nthe ground around them as if it had been a fallow field; men spoke to\r\ntheir comrades, and before receiving a reply were shot dead at their\r\nsides. The wounded were more ghastly than the dead; their faces growing\r\nsuddenly deadly white from the shock as they were struck.\r\n\r\nThe gunners lay in piles around their guns, and still the survivors\r\nworked furiously in the dense heat and smoke, the sweat pouring down\r\ntheir blackened faces. The fire was terrific.\r\n\r\nSuddenly an officer galloped up, and spoke to the lieutenant of the\r\nnearest battery.\r\n\r\n\"Where is the colonel?\"\r\n\r\n\"Killed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is your captain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dead, there under the gun.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you in command?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, hold this hill.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long?\"\r\n\r\n\"Forever.\" And he galloped off.\r\n\r\nHis voice was heard clear and ringing in a sudden lull, and the old\r\nSergeant, clutching his musket, shouted:\r\n\r\n\"We will, forever.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a momentary lull.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the cry was:\r\n\r\n\"Here they are.\"\r\n\r\nIn an instant a dark line of men appeared coming up the slope. The guns\r\nwere trained down on them, but shot over their heads; they were double\r\nshotted and trained lower, and belched forth canister. They fell in\r\nswathes, yet still they came on at a run, hurrahing, until they were\r\nalmost up among the guns, and the gunners were leaving their pieces. The\r\nold Sergeant's voice speaking to his men was as steady as if on parade,\r\nand kept them down, and when the command was given to fire kneeling,\r\nthey rose as one man, and poured a volley into the Germans' faces which\r\nsent them reeling back down the hill, leaving a broken line of dead and\r\nstruggling men on the deadly crest. Just then a brigade officer came\r\nalong. They heard him say, \"That repulse may stop them.\" Then he\r\ngave some order in an undertone to the lieutenant in command of the\r\nbatteries, and passed on. A moment later the fire from the Prussian\r\nbatteries was heavier than before; the guns were being knocked to\r\npieces. A piece of shell struck the Sergeant on the cheek, tearing away\r\nthe flesh badly. He tore the sleeve from his shirt and tied it around\r\nhis head with perfect unconcern. The fire of the Germans was still\r\ngrowing heavier; the smoke was too dense to see a great deal, but they\r\nwere concentrating or were coming closer. The lieutenant came back for\r\na moment and spoke to the captain of the company, who, looking along the\r\nline, called the Sergeant, and ordered him to go back down the hill to\r\nwhere the road turned behind it, and tell General ------ to send them\r\na support instantly, as the batteries were knocked to pieces, and they\r\ncould not hold the hill much longer. The announcement was astonishing\r\nto the old soldier; it had never occurred to him that as long as a man\r\nremained they could not hold the hill, and he was half-way down the\r\nslope before he took it in. He had brought his gun with him, and he\r\nclutched it convulsively as if he could withstand alone the whole\r\nPrussian army. \"He might have taken a younger man to do his trotting,\"\r\nhe muttered to himself as he stalked along, not knowing that his wound\r\nhad occasioned his selection. \"Pierre--\" but, no, Pierre must stay where\r\nhe would have the opportunity to distinguish himself.\r\n\r\nIt was no holiday promenade that the old soldier was taking; for his\r\npath lay right across the track swept by the German batteries, and the\r\nwhole distance was strewn with dead, killed as they had advanced in the\r\nmorning. But the old Sergeant got safely across. He found the General\r\nwith one or two members of his staff sitting on horseback in the road\r\nnear the park gate, receiving and answering dispatches. He delivered his\r\nmessage.\r\n\r\n\"Go back and tell him he _must_ hold it,\" was the reply. \"Upon it\r\ndepends the fate of the day; perhaps of France. Or wait, you are\r\nwounded; I will send some one else; you go to the rear.\" And he gave\r\nthe order to one of his staff, who saluted and dashed off on his horse.\r\n\"Hold it for France,\" he called after him.\r\n\r\nThe words were heard perfectly clear even above the din of battle which\r\nwas steadily increasing all along the line, and they stirred the old\r\nsoldier like a trumpet. No rear for him! He turned and pushed back up\r\nthe hill at a run. The road had somewhat changed since he left, but\r\nhe marked it not; shot and shell were ploughing across his path more\r\nthickly, but he did not heed them; in his ears rang the words--\"For\r\nFrance.\" They came like an echo from the past; it was the same cry he\r\nhad heard at Waterloo, when the soldiers of France that summer day\r\nhad died for France and the emperor, with a cheer on their lips. \"For\r\nFrance\": the words were consecrated; the emperor himself had used them.\r\nHe had heard him, and would have died then; should he not die now for\r\nher! Was it not glorious to die for France, and have men say that he had\r\nfought for her when a babe, and had died for her when an old man!\r\n\r\nWith these thoughts was mingled the thought of Pierre--Pierre also would\r\ndie for France! They would save her or die together; and he pressed his\r\nhand with a proud caress over the cross on his breast. It was the emblem\r\nof glory.\r\n\r\nHe was almost back with his men now; he knew it by the roar, but the\r\nsmoke hid everything. Just then it shifted a little. As it did so, he\r\nsaw a man steal out of the dim line and start towards him at a run. He\r\nhad on the uniform of his regiment. His cap was pulled over his eyes,\r\nand he saw him deliberately fling away his gun. He was skulking. All\r\nthe blood boiled up in the old soldier's veins. Desert!--not fight for\r\nFrance! Why did not Pierre shoot him! Just then the coward passed close\r\nto him, and the old man seized him with a grip of iron. The deserter,\r\nsurprised, turned his face; it was pallid with terror and shame; but no\r\nmore so than his captor's. It was Pierre.\r\n\r\n\"Pierre!\" he gasped. \"Good God! where are you going?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sick,\" faltered the other.\r\n\r\n\"Come back,\" said the father sternly.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot,\" was the terrified answer.\r\n\r\n\"It is for France, Pierre,\" pleaded the old soldier.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! I cannot,\" moaned the young man, pulling away. There was a\r\npause--the old man still holding on hesitatingly, then,--\"Dastard!\" he\r\nhissed, flinging his son from him with indescribable scorn.\r\n\r\nPierre, free once more, was slinking off with averted face, when anew\r\nidea seized his father, and his face grew grim as stone. Cocking his\r\nmusket, he flung it up, took careful and deliberate aim at his son's\r\nretreating figure, and brought his finger slowly down upon the trigger.\r\nBut, before he could fire, a shell exploded directly in the line of his\r\naim, and when the smoke blew off, Pierre had disappeared. The Sergeant\r\nlowered his piece, gazed curiously down the hill, and then hurried to\r\nthe spot where the shell had burst. A mangled form marked the place. The\r\ncoward had in the very act of flight met the death he dreaded. Pierre\r\nlay dead on his face, shot in the back. The back of his head was\r\nshattered by a fragment of shell. The countenance of the living man\r\nwas more pallid than that of the dead. No word escaped him, except that\r\nrefrain, \"For France, for France,\" which he repeated mechanically.\r\n\r\nAlthough this had occupied but a few minutes, momentous changes had\r\ntaken place on the ridge above. The sound of the battle had somewhat\r\naltered, and with the roar of artillery were mingled now the continuous\r\nrattle of the musketry and the shouts and cheers of the contending\r\ntroops. The fierce onslaught of the Prussians had broken the line\r\nsomewhere beyond the batteries, and the French were being borne back.\r\nAlmost immediately the slope was filled with retreating men hurrying\r\nback in the demoralization of panic. All order was lost. It was a rout.\r\nThe soldiers of his own regiment began to rush by the spot where the\r\nold Sergeant stood above his son's body. Recognizing him, some of his\r\ncomrades seized his arm and attempted to hurry him along; but with a\r\nfierce exclamation the old soldier shook them off, and raising his voice\r\nso that he was heard even above the tumult of the rout, he shouted, \"Are\r\nye all cowards? Rally for France--For France----\"\r\n\r\nThey tried to bear him along; the officers, they said, were dead; the\r\nPrussians had captured the guns, and had broken the whole line. But it\r\nwas no use; still he shouted that rallying cry, For France, for France,\r\n\"Vive la France; Vive l'Empereur\"; and steadied by the war-cry, and\r\naccustomed to obey an officer, the men around him fell instinctively\r\ninto something like order, and for an instant the rout was arrested. The\r\nfight was renewed over Pierre's dead body. As they had, however, truly\r\nsaid, the Prussians were too strong for them. They had carried the line\r\nand were now pouring down the hill by thousands in the ardor of hot\r\npursuit, the line on either side of the hill was swept away, and whilst\r\nthe gallant little band about the old soldier still stood and fought\r\ndesperately, they were soon surrounded. There was no thought of quarter;\r\nnone was asked, none was given. Cries, curses, cheers, shots, blows,\r\nwere mingled together, and clear above all rang the old soldier's\r\nwar-cry, For France, for France, \"Vive la France, Vive l'Empereur.\" It\r\nwas the refrain from an older and bloodier field. He thought he was at\r\nWaterloo.\r\n\r\nMad with excitement, the men took up the cry, and fought like tigers;\r\nbut the issue could not be doubtful.\r\n\r\nMan after man fell, shot or clubbed down, with the cry \"For France\"\r\non his lips, and his comrades, standing astride his body, fought with\r\nbayonets and clubbed muskets till they too fell in turn. Almost the last\r\none was the old Sergeant. Wounded to death, and bleeding from numberless\r\ngashes, he still fought, shouting his battle-cry, \"For France,\" till\r\nhis musket was hurled spinning from his shattered hand, and staggering\r\nsenseless back, a dozen bayonets were driven into his breast, crushing\r\nout forever the brave spirit of the soldier of the empire.\r\n\r\nIt was best, for France was lost.\r\n\r\nA few hours later the Quarter was in mourning over the terrible defeat.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nThat night a group of Prussian officers going over the field with\r\nlanterns looking after their wounded, stopped near a spot remarkable\r\neven on that bloody slope for the heaps of dead of both armies literally\r\npiled upon each other.\r\n\r\n\"It was just here,\" said one, \"that they got reinforcements and made\r\nthat splendid rally.\"\r\n\r\nA second, looking at the body of an old French sergeant lying amidst\r\nheaps of slain, with his face to the sky, said simply as he saw his\r\nscars:\r\n\r\n\"There died a brave soldier.\"\r\n\r\nAnother, older than the first, bending closer to count the bayonet\r\nwounds, caught the gleam of something in the light of the lantern,\r\nand stooping to examine a broken cross of the Legion on the dead man's\r\nbreast, said reverently:\r\n\r\n\"He was a _soldier of the empire_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's \"A Soldier Of The Empire\", by Thomas Nelson Page",

It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenbergâ¢âs\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenbergâ¢ collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenbergâ¢ and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundationâs EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenbergâ¢ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenbergâ¢ electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenbergâ¢ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenbergâ¢ eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenbergâ¢ eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenbergâ¢,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks."
