ROOSEVELT’S VIEWS ON\r\n                  MANY OF THE GREAT NATIONAL ISSUES OF\r\n                  TODAY. THEY WERE WRITTEN SINCE MR.\r\n                  ROOSEVELT’S RETURN TO AMERICA, AND\r\n                  APPEARED ORIGINALLY IN THE OUTLOOK\r\n                  AS EDITORIALS OR ARTICLES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Management of Small States Which are Unable to Manage Themselves\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the issue of The Outlook for June 18 there was a quotation from a\r\nletter of an Anti-Imperialist correspondent, who, in speaking of Egypt\r\nand the Philippines, stated that the proper course to pursue was to\r\nprotect countries of this nature by international agreement, the writer\r\nciting in support of his theory the way in which many small powers had\r\ntheir territories guaranteed by international agreement.\r\n\r\nThe trouble is in the confusion of ideas which results in trying to\r\napply the same principle to two totally different classes of cases. A\r\nState like Switzerland or Holland differs only in size from the greatest\r\nof civilized nations, and in everything except size stands at least on a\r\nlevel with them. Such a State is absolutely competent to preserve order\r\nwithin its own bounds, to execute substantial justice, and to secure the\r\nrights of foreigners. All that is necessary, therefore, is to guarantee\r\nit against aggression; and when the great Powers have thus guaranteed\r\nit, all covenanting to protect it from the aggression of any one of\r\ntheir own number, their duty is done and the needs of the situation\r\ncompletely met. In such a State the people themselves guarantee\r\nstability, order, liberty, and protection for the rights of others.\r\nThere is not the slightest need of interfering with them, of seeking to\r\ndevelop them, of protecting them from themselves. The needs of\r\ncivilization and humanity are sufficiently met by protecting them from\r\noutside aggression.\r\n\r\nThere is no analogy at all with what occurs in a community unable to\r\nkeep elementary order, or to secure elementary justice within its own\r\nborders, and unable or unwilling to do justice to foreign nations. The\r\nvery worst thing from the standpoint of humanity which can happen to\r\nsuch a community may be to guarantee it against outside aggression. The\r\ncondition of Algeria under French rule is infinitely better than its\r\ncondition before the French came to Algeria, or than the condition of\r\nMorocco at this moment. The condition of Turkestan under Russia has very\r\ngreatly improved. The condition of the Sudan at present, as compared\r\nwith the condition of the Sudan under Mahdist rule, is the most striking\r\nexample of all. In the same way, Panama has benefited immeasurably from\r\nevery standpoint by the presence of Americans on the Isthmus. Any\r\narrangement which had guaranteed Algeria against the French, or\r\nTurkestan against the Russians, or the Sudan against the English, or\r\nPanama against the Americans, would have been an arrangement against the\r\ninterests of humanity and civilization, and against the interests of the\r\nnatives of the countries themselves.\r\n\r\nMoreover, if there must be interference for the sake of the country\r\nitself, to promote its growth in order and civilization, actual\r\nexperience has shown that such interference can only come efficiently by\r\none nation, and not by many. Untried theorists, or even practical men\r\nwho are influenced by national jealousy and are untaught by the lessons\r\nof history, have a curious fondness for trying a system of joint\r\ninterference or joint control. Americans forget, for instance, that we\r\nhave actually tried this system and found it completely wanting, in the\r\ncase of Samoa. We made an arrangement with England and Germany by which\r\nthere was a joint protectorate over Samoa. The system worked wretchedly.\r\nIt resulted badly for the natives; it was a fruitful source of bickering\r\namong the three Powers. Then we abandoned the system, each Power took\r\nits own sphere, and since then we have gotten along admirably; the only\r\ntrouble in connection with Samoa which arose during my entire\r\nadministration as President came because we were not able to grant the\r\nearnest request of the natives that we should take real and complete\r\npossession of our part of the islands and really regulate the government\r\ninstead of leaving it so much in the hands of the native chiefs.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the Philippines, there were just two things that we could\r\ndo which would have been worse than leaving them under Spanish rule. One\r\nof these would have been to turn the islands adrift to manage\r\nthemselves. The second would have been to try to manage them by a joint\r\narrangement of various Powers. Any such arrangement in the case of as\r\nrich and valuable islands as the Philippines would very possibly have\r\nled to war between the great Powers. It would have certainly led to\r\njealousy, bickerings, and intrigue among them, would have held the\r\nislands back, would have prevented any development along the lines of\r\nprogress and civilization, and would have insured an endless succession\r\nof devastating little civil wars.\r\n\r\nWhen all that is necessary as regards a small State is to protect it\r\nfrom external aggression, then the great Powers can with advantage join\r\nto guarantee its integrity. When anything more is necessary to try to\r\ndevelop the people and civilization, to put down disorder, to stop civil\r\nwar and secure justice, then a combination of Powers offers the worst\r\npossible way of securing the object sought to be achieved. Indeed, under\r\nsuch circumstances it is probably better for the State concerned to be\r\nunder the control of a single Power, even though this Power has not high\r\nideals, rather than under the control of three or four Powers which may\r\npossess high ideals but which are put into such an impossible situation\r\nthat they are certain to be riven asunder by jealousy, distrust, and\r\nintrigue, and to do damage rather than good to the people whom they are\r\nsupposed to protect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             A Remedy for Some Forms of Selfish Legislation\r\n\r\n\r\nThe August number of the “World’s Work” contains an article which is of\r\ninterest to all who are concerned in the vital subject to which we give\r\nthe somewhat foggy title of “Political Reform.” The article, for obvious\r\nreasons anonymous, is written by a member of Congress who, the editors\r\nof the “World’s Work” say, has served for more than ten years in the\r\nHouse of Representatives, has acted on many important committees, and\r\nhas been successful in “getting things” for his constituency. The\r\narticle is described as “showing the reason why the ‘pork-barrel,’\r\nspecial tariff favors, and private pension bills become law,” the reason\r\nbeing, to quote the words of the author, that “the dictum of the\r\nconstituency to the Congressmen is, ‘Get all you can for US.’ There are\r\nno restrictions placed upon his method of getting it.... Until the\r\nAmerican people themselves become more National and less local, until\r\nconstituencies cease to regard their Congressmen as solicitors at the\r\nNational Treasury, Congress will continue to enact iniquitous groups of\r\nlocal favors into National legislation.”\r\n\r\nThis serious charge against the American people—for which there is\r\nunquestionably altogether too much justification—the author proceeds to\r\nsubstantiate by relating some of his own experiences with constituents\r\nwhich, however surprising they may seem to the general reader, will seem\r\nalmost commonplace to all who know how the average American constituency\r\ndoes in actual practice treat its Congressman.\r\n\r\nThe writer sets forth the fact that, in the first place, ninety per cent\r\nof the letters which a Congressman receives are requests for special\r\nfavors to be obtained in some way or other, directly or indirectly, from\r\nthe United States Treasury. For instance, while the Payne-Aldrich Tariff\r\nLaw was under discussion, this particular Congressman received in May,\r\n1909, the following letter from the secretary of a powerful commercial\r\nassociation in his district:\r\n\r\n  I have been instructed by the board of directors of this association\r\n  to advise you that at special meeting May 20, a resolution, copy of\r\n  which is enclosed, was unanimously adopted, urging our\r\n  Representatives in Congress to use every endeavor to have the\r\n  present tariff on [mentioning three of the products of the\r\n  industries referred to] increased one cent per pound and the present\r\n  tariff on [mentioning the other two products] increased half a cent\r\n  per pound. I wish to further advise you that we have heard from\r\n  Senator —— and he informs us that he will take care of this matter\r\n  in the Senate.\r\n\r\nWhen the bill was finally passed, the Congressman succeeded in adding\r\nhalf a cent a pound to the duty on two of these products and in\r\npreventing any reduction on the others. A year later, when the popular\r\nclamor against the bill had become acute, the same association that had\r\nasked him to vote for increases wrote to the Congressman denouncing the\r\nbill as “the most iniquitous measure ever enacted by Congress” and\r\nrequesting him to explain by letter why he had voted with “the\r\nReactionaries” to pass the bill. When it was pointed out to the\r\nassociation that it had urged the Congressman to obtain an increase of\r\nduty on the products in which it was interested, it dropped its demand\r\nfor an explanation. An influential newspaper published in his district\r\neditorially commended him while the bill was under debate for his\r\n“intelligent efforts” to increase the duty on manufactured articles in\r\nwhich the district was interested, and a year later the same newspaper\r\nin the same editorial column denounced him as one of “the legislative\r\nbanditti responsible for the Payne-Aldrich measure.”\r\n\r\nAs with the tariff, so with pensions; the Congressman is urged to obtain\r\nlocal favors without regard to National interests. This is illustrated\r\nby the following letter, which the author prints, and which was written\r\nby the clergyman of a large and wealthy church:\r\n\r\n  _My dear Congressman_: I received a call from James H. —— several\r\n  days ago, and he told me that he had received a very unsatisfactory\r\n  letter from you regarding his chances for getting a pension. Now,\r\n  Congressman, while I know he deserted during the second year of the\r\n  war, yet there must be some way the matter can be covered up and ——\r\n  be given a pensionable status. He is at present a charge on my\r\n  congregation. Every one seems to be able to get a pension. Why not\r\n  he? Do what you can for him, and oblige.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that this is a unique instance from which it is unfair to\r\ndraw a general inference. The confessing Congressman answers, No; that\r\nhe has “hundreds of such letters filed away. So has every other\r\nCongressman.”\r\n\r\nRiver and harbor legislation is another field in which local selfishness\r\nbusies itself, to the exclusion of National needs. In this case requests\r\nare not made by letter but by delegations which come to Washington\r\nbesieging their Senators and Representatives. “There is,” says the frank\r\nwriter of this article, “figuratively speaking, between $50,000,000 and\r\n$60,000,000 on the table to be divided. The Committee divides it so that\r\nevery one is satisfied, at least to a reasonable extent.” Every one,\r\nthat is, but the people at large, the people who have no special\r\ninterest to serve, and who feel keenly indignant that the rivers and\r\nharbors of the United States are developed in a fashion so inferior to\r\nthat of Europe.\r\n\r\nNor are all the requests for legislation merely. One constituent desired\r\nto have this particular Congressman put his name on the free mailing\r\nlist for all public documents. That this would be impossible, because it\r\nwould mean delivering to the applicant several tons of documents every\r\nmonth, does not in the slightest detract from the interest of the fact\r\nelicited by an investigation that the applicant was the manufacturer of\r\nan article made from waste paper, and the public documents would afford\r\na useful source of raw material.\r\n\r\nIs there a remedy for such a state of things? The answer is, yes; and,\r\nmoreover, it is a remedy which Congress can itself immediately provide.\r\n\r\nThere is no complete remedy, of course. No scheme can be devised which\r\ncan prevent such a request as that of the constituent last named who\r\nwished public documents to use in his private paper business. Requests\r\nlike this merely mean that in every district individuals will always be\r\nfound who will request improper favors. As regards these people, all\r\nthat can be done is to create a vigorous public opinion—an opinion which\r\nshall not only make it uncomfortable for any man to demand such favors,\r\nbut which shall cordially support the Congressman in refusing them and\r\nhold him accountable for granting them. We must trust to individual\r\nintegrity to resist such individual and sporadic attempts to corrupt it.\r\n\r\nThe case is entirely different when we come to the other favors\r\nmentioned. These favors are those which the Congressman describes as\r\nbeing improperly, habitually, and insistently demanded by large portions\r\nof a given constituency, with at least the acquiescence of the\r\nconstituency as a whole. It is futile to expect to cure this type of\r\nevil merely by solemnly saying that each Congressman ought to be good.\r\nIt is futile to ask the average Congressman to cut his own throat by\r\ndisregarding the requests of his own constituents for special and\r\nimproper favors in the matter of tariff legislation, river and harbor\r\nlegislation, and pension legislation; even though these same\r\nconstituents adopt the beautifully illogical position of expressing a\r\ngreat—and, curiously enough, often a sincere—indignation that their\r\nCongressman, as the only means of securing for them what they insist he\r\nshall secure, joins with other Congressmen in granting for all other\r\nconstituencies the same improper favors which are eagerly demanded by\r\nhis own individual constituency. Moreover, under the present system, the\r\nsmall man, when he asks for something in which his own district is\r\nkeenly interested, is told by the big man who represents the big\r\ninterest that he can’t have his little favor granted unless he agrees to\r\nstand by those who wish to grant the big favor—and the small man may be\r\nremorselessly “held up” in this fashion, even though the small favor he\r\nasks is proper, and the big favor he is required to grant entirely\r\nimproper. When such is the pressure upon the average Representative,\r\nthere is certain to be more or less yielding on his part, in the great\r\nmajority of cases. It is idle to hope that reform will come through mere\r\ndenunciation of the average Congressman, or by merely beseeching him to\r\nreach the height of courage, wisdom, and disinterestedness achieved only\r\nby the exceptional man; by the man who is so brave and far-seeing and\r\nhigh-minded that he really will think only of the interests of the\r\ncountry as a whole.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is just as idle for Congressmen to seek to excuse\r\nthemselves as a body by uttering jeremiads as to the improper way in\r\nwhich their constituents press them to do things that ought not to be\r\ndone. The individual Congressman can be excused only by frankly\r\nadmitting that the fault lies with the Congressmen taken collectively.\r\nThe remedy is simple and easy of application.\r\n\r\nCongress has now, and has long had, the power to rid its members of\r\nalmost all the improper pressure brought to bear upon the individual by\r\nspecial interests—great and small, local and metropolitan—on such\r\nsubjects as tariff legislation, river and harbor legislation, and\r\npension legislation. Congress has not exercised this power, chiefly\r\nbecause of what I am bound to regard as a very shortsighted and unwise\r\nbelief that it is beneath its dignity to delegate any of its functions.\r\nBy passing a rule which would forbid the reception or passage of any\r\npension bill save the pension legislation recommended by the\r\nCommissioner of Pensions (this of course to be rejected or amended as\r\nCongress saw fit, but not so amended as to include any special or\r\nprivate legislation), Congress would at once do away with the\r\npossibility of its members being subject to local pressure for improper\r\nprivate pension bills, and at the same time guarantee proper treatment\r\nfor the veteran who really does deserve to have everything done for him\r\nthat the country can afford. The veteran of this stamp has no stancher\r\nfriend than the Commissioner of Pensions; whereas he is often the very\r\nman passed over when special bills are introduced, because the less\r\ndeserving men are at least as apt as the others to have political\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the tariff and the river and harbor legislation, what is\r\nneeded in each case is ample provision for a commission of the highest\r\npossible grade, composed of men who thoroughly know the subject, and who\r\npossess every attribute required for the performance of the great and\r\ndifficult task of framing in outline the legislation that the country,\r\nas distinguished from special interests, really needs. These men, from\r\nthe very nature of the case, will be wholly free from the local pressure\r\nof special interests so keenly felt by every man who is dependent upon\r\nthe vote of a particular district every two years for his continuance in\r\npublic life. Such a river and harbor commission could report, and\r\nprobably would report, a great and comprehensive National scheme for\r\nriver and harbor improvements fit to be considered by the people as a\r\nwhole upon its merits, and not dependent for enactment into law upon a\r\nsystem of log-rolling designed to placate special interests which are\r\npowerful in each of many score Congressional districts. Such a tariff\r\ncommission could get at the facts of labor cost here and abroad by\r\nexpert inquiry, and not by the acceptance of interested testimony; such\r\na commission could consider dispassionately the probable effect upon the\r\nentire social and economic body of all changes in any given branch of\r\nthe tariff, and its recommendations would represent the exercise of\r\ncareful judgment from a disinterested standpoint. Such a commission\r\ncould work in harmony with the Commissioner of Labor, so as to insure\r\nthat the laborers for whom the tariff is passed get the full benefit of\r\nit; for the major part of the benefit of a protective tariff should\r\nunquestionably go to the wage-workers.\r\n\r\nEven under such conditions of tariff-making errors might be committed,\r\nbut they would be merely those errors of disinterested judgment\r\nincidental to every kind of public or, for the matter of that, private\r\neffort, and the work would not be hampered from the beginning by the\r\nneed of gratifying private selfishness.\r\n\r\nIt is only in this way that tariff legislation, river and harbor\r\nlegislation, and pension legislation can be treated from the standpoint\r\nof principle and not from the very low standpoint of privilege and\r\npreference. The obstacle hitherto to the adoption of such a method of\r\ntreatment has come from the queer dislike felt by so many Congressional\r\nleaders to a course of action which they (quite unjustifiably) feel\r\nwould in some way be a limitation of their powers. I think this feeling\r\nis passing. It is simply another instance of the kind of feeling which\r\nmakes some executives suspicious about delegating their work to any\r\nsubordinate, and which makes many voters, who have not pondered the\r\nmatter deeply, desire to elect great numbers of people on a ticket of\r\nsuch length that it is out of the question for any except professional\r\npoliticians to know much about them.\r\n\r\nAs soon as business becomes at all complex—and nothing can be more\r\ncomplex than the business of a Nation of a hundred million people—it can\r\nonly be performed by delegating to experts the duty of dealing with all\r\nthat can properly be delegated. It is only by such delegation that it is\r\npossible to secure the proper consideration of the exceedingly important\r\nbusiness which cannot properly be delegated. The voters, as a whole, for\r\ninstance, must necessarily declare directly upon all really vital\r\nissues, and they should do this when the issue is a man just as much as\r\nwhen the issue is one of legislation. Indeed, in my judgment, there are\r\ncertain matters, as to which the voters do not at present have the\r\nchance of thus acting directly, where it is important that the chance be\r\ngiven them. But they can only exercise such choice with wisdom and\r\nbenefit where it is vitally necessary to exercise it, on condition of\r\nnot being confused by the requirement of exercising it in the great\r\nmultitude of cases where there is no such necessity, and where they can\r\nwith advantage delegate the duty to the man they deem most fit to do the\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nWhat is true of the voters is equally true of legislators and\r\nadministrators the moment that their tasks become sufficiently complex.\r\nThe village constable in a small community can do all his work directly.\r\nBut the President of the United States can do his work at all only by\r\ndelegating the enormous mass of it to his appointees, and by confining\r\nhis own share of the purely administrative work largely to supervision\r\nand direction of these employees. When a President appoints a commission\r\nto investigate such a vital matter as, for instance, country life, or\r\nthe conservation of natural resources, he does not abdicate his own\r\nauthority; he merely faces the fact that by no possibility can he\r\nhimself do this important piece of work as well as the experts whom he\r\nappoints to devote their whole time to that purpose. Now, Congress can\r\nwith wisdom act in such matters of prime legislative importance as the\r\ntariff and river and harbor improvement, in the same way that the\r\nPresident acts in such matters of prime administrative importance as\r\ncountry life and conservation. It no more represents abdication of power\r\non the part of Congress to appoint a first-class Tariff Commission than\r\nit represents abdication of power on the part of the President to\r\nappoint a first-class Country Life or Conservation Commission, or than\r\nit represents abdication of power on the part of voters to elect as\r\nGovernor a man to whom they give all possible power to do his work well.\r\nIn each case the body delegating the authority, so far from abdicating\r\nthe power, has secured its wise use by intrusting it to a man or men\r\nespecially equipped thus to use it well, and this man, or these men, can\r\nin turn be held to the most rigid accountability if it is not well used,\r\nin the exclusive service of the people as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Rural Life\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are no two public questions of more vital importance to the future\r\nof this country than the problem of Conservation and the problem of the\r\nbetterment of country life. Moreover, these two problems are really\r\ninterdependent, for neither of them can be successfully solved save on\r\ncondition that there is at least a measurable success in the effort to\r\nsolve the other. In any great country the prime physical asset—the\r\nphysical asset more valuable than any other—is the fertility of the\r\nsoil. All our industrial and commercial welfare, all our material\r\ndevelopment of every kind, depends in the last resort upon our\r\npreserving and increasing the fertility of the soil. This, of course,\r\nmeans the conservation of the soil as the great natural resource; and\r\nequally, of course, it furthermore implies the development of country\r\nlife, for there cannot be a permanent improvement of the soil if the\r\nlife of those who live on it, and make their living out of it, is\r\nsuffered to starve and languish, to become stunted and weazened and\r\ninferior to the type of life lived elsewhere. We are now trying to\r\npreserve, not for exploitation by individuals, but for the permanent\r\nbenefit of the whole people, the waters and the forests, and we are\r\ndoing this primarily as a means of adding to the fertility of the soil;\r\nalthough in each case there is a great secondary use both of the water\r\nand of the forests for commercial and industrial purposes. In the same\r\nway it is essential for the farmers themselves to try to broaden the\r\nlife of the man who lives in the open country; to make it more\r\nattractive; to give it every adjunct and aid to development which has\r\nbeen given to the life of the man of the cities. Therefore the\r\nconservation and rural life policies are really two sides of the same\r\npolicy; and down at bottom this policy rests upon the fundamental law\r\nthat neither man nor nation can prosper unless, in dealing with the\r\npresent, thought is steadily taken for the future.\r\n\r\nIn one sense this problem with which we have to deal is very, very old.\r\nWherever civilizations have hitherto sprung up they have always tended\r\nto go through certain stages and then to fall. No nation can develop a\r\nreal civilization without cities. Up to a certain point the city\r\nmovement is thoroughly healthy; yet it is a strange and lamentable fact\r\nthat always hitherto after this point has been reached the city has\r\ntended to develop at the expense of the country by draining the country\r\nof what is best in it, and making an insignificant return for this best.\r\nIn consequence, in the past, every civilization in its later stages has\r\ntended really to witness those conditions under which “the cities\r\nprosper and the men decay.” There are ugly signs that these tendencies\r\nare at work in this nation of ours. But very fortunately we see now what\r\nnever before was seen in any civilization—an aroused and alert public\r\ninterest in the problem, a recognition of its gravity and a desire to\r\nattempt its solution.\r\n\r\nThe problem does not consist merely in the growth of the city. Such a\r\ngrowth in itself is a good thing and not a bad thing for the country.\r\nThe problem consists in the growth of the city at the expense of the\r\ncountry; and, even where this is not the case, in so great an equality\r\nof growth in power and interest as to make the city more attractive than\r\nthe country, and therefore apt to drain the country of the people who\r\nought to live therein.\r\n\r\nThe human side of the rural life problem is to make the career of the\r\nfarmer and the career of the farm laborer as attractive and as\r\nremunerative as corresponding careers in the city. Now, I am well aware\r\nthat the farmer must himself take the lead in bringing this about. A\r\ncentury and a quarter ago the wise English farmer, Arthur Young, wrote\r\nof the efforts to improve French wool: “A cultivator at the head of a\r\nsheep farm of 3,000 or 4,000 acres would in a few years do more for\r\ntheir wools than all the academicians and philosophers will effect in\r\nten centuries.” It is absurd to think that any man who has studied the\r\nsubject only theoretically is fit to direct those who practically work\r\nat the matter. But I wish to insist to you here—to you practical men,\r\nwho own and work your farms—that it is an equally pernicious absurdity\r\nfor the practical man to refuse to benefit by the work of the student.\r\nThe English farmer I have quoted, Young, was a practical farmer, but he\r\nwas also a scientific farmer. One reason why the great business men of\r\nto-day—the great industrial leaders—have gone ahead, while the farmer\r\nhas tended to sag behind the others, is that they are far more willing,\r\nand indeed eager, to profit by expert and technical knowledge—the\r\nknowledge that can come only as a result of the highest education. From\r\nrailways to factories no great industrial concern can nowadays be\r\ncarried on save by the aid of a swarm of men who have received a high\r\ntechnical education in chemistry, in engineering, in electricity, in one\r\nor more of scores of special subjects. The big business man, the big\r\nrailway man, does not ask college-trained experts to tell him how to run\r\nhis business; but he does ask numbers of them each to give him expert\r\nadvice and aid on some one point indispensable to his business. He finds\r\nthis man usually in some graduate of a technical school or college in\r\nwhich he has been trained for his life work.\r\n\r\nIn just the same way the farmers should benefit by the advice of the\r\ntechnical men who have been trained in phases of the very work the\r\nfarmer does. I am not now speaking of the man who has had an ordinary\r\ngeneral training, whether in school or college. While there should\r\nundoubtedly be such a training as a foundation (the extent differing\r\naccording to the kind of work each boy intends to do as a man), it is\r\nnevertheless true that our educational system should more and more be\r\nturned in the direction of educating men towards, and not away from, the\r\nfarm and the shop. During the last half-century we have begun to develop\r\na system of agricultural education at once practical and scientific, and\r\nwe must go on developing it. But, after developing it, it must be used.\r\nThe rich man who spends a fortune upon a fancy farm, with entire\r\nindifference to cost, does not do much good to farming; but, on the\r\nother hand, just as little is done by the working farmer who stolidly\r\nrefuses to profit by the knowledge of the day; who treats any effort at\r\nimprovement as absurd on its face, refuses to countenance what he\r\nregards as new-fangled ideas and contrivances, and jeers at all “book\r\nfarming.” I wish I could take representatives of this type of farmer\r\ndown to Long Island, where I live, to have them see what has been done,\r\nnot as philanthropy but as a plain business proposition, by men\r\nconnected with the Long Island Railroad, who believe it pays to\r\nencourage the development of farms along the line of that railway. They\r\nhave put practical men in charge of experimental farms, cultivating them\r\nintensively, and using the best modern methods, not only in raising\r\ncrops, but in securing the best market for the crops when raised. The\r\ngrowth has been astounding, and land only fifty miles from New York,\r\nwhich during our entire National lifetime has been treated as worthless,\r\nhas within the last three or four years been proved to possess a really\r\nhigh value.\r\n\r\nThe farmer, however, must not only make his land pay, but he must make\r\ncountry life interesting for himself and for his wife and his sons and\r\ndaughters. Our people as a whole should realize the infinite\r\npossibilities of life in the country; and every effort should be made to\r\nmake these possibilities more possible. From the beginning of time it\r\nhas been the man raised in the country—and usually the man born in the\r\ncountry—who has been most apt to render the services which every nation\r\nmost needs. Turning to the list of American statesmen, it is\r\nextraordinary to see how large a proportion started as farm boys. But it\r\nis rather sad to see that in recent years most of these same boys have\r\nended their lives as men living in cities.\r\n\r\nIt often happens that the good conditions of the past can be regained,\r\nnot by going back, but by going forward. We cannot re-create what is\r\ndead; we cannot stop the march of events; but we can direct this march,\r\nand out of the new conditions develop something better than the past\r\nknew. Henry Clay was a farmer who lived all his life in the country;\r\nWashington was a farmer who lived and died in the country; and we of\r\nthis Nation ought to make it our business to see that the conditions are\r\nmade such that farm life in the future shall not only develop men of the\r\nstamp of Washington and Henry Clay, but shall be so attractive that\r\nthese men may continue as farmers; for remember that Washington and\r\nHenry Clay were successful farmers. I hope that things will so shape\r\nthemselves that the farmer can have a great career and yet end his life\r\nas a farmer; so that the city man will look forward to living in the\r\ncountry rather than the country man to living in the city.\r\n\r\nFarmers should learn how to combine effectively, as has been done in\r\nindustry. I heartily believe in farmers’ organizations; and we should\r\nall welcome every step taken towards an increasing co-operation among\r\nfarmers. The importance of such movements cannot be over-estimated; and\r\nthrough such intelligent joint action it will be possible to improve the\r\nmarket just as much as the farm.\r\n\r\nCountry life should be as attractive as city life, and the country\r\npeople should insist upon having their full representation when it comes\r\nto dealing with all great public questions. In other words, country\r\nfolks should demand that they work on equal terms with city folks in all\r\nsuch matters. They should have their share in the memberships of\r\ncommissions and councils; in short, of all the organized bodies for\r\nlaying plans for great enterprises affecting all the people. I am glad\r\nto see on such bodies the names that represent financial interests, but\r\nthose interests should not have the right-of-way, and in all enterprises\r\nand movements in which the social condition of the country is involved,\r\nthe agricultural country—the open country—should be as well represented\r\nas the city. The man of the open country is apt to have certain\r\nqualities which the city man has lost. These qualities offset those\r\nwhich the city man has and he himself has not. The two should be put on\r\nequal terms, and the country talent be given the same opportunity as the\r\ncity talent to express itself and to contribute to the welfare of the\r\nworld in which we live.\r\n\r\nThe country church should be made a true social center, alive to every\r\nneed of the community, standing for a broad individual outlook and\r\ndevelopment, taking the lead in work and in recreation, caring more for\r\nconduct than for dogma, more for ethical, spiritual, practical\r\nbetterment than for merely formal piety. The country fair offers far\r\ngreater possibilities for continuous and healthy usefulness than it at\r\npresent affords. The country school should be made a vital center for\r\neconomic, social, and educational co-operation; it is naturally fitted\r\nto be such a center for those engaged in commercial farming, and still\r\nmore for those engaged in domestic farming, for those who live on and by\r\nthe small farms they themselves own. The problem of the farm is really\r\nthe problem of the family that lives on the farm. On all these questions\r\nthere is need of intelligent study, such as marks the books of Professor\r\nBailey, of Cornell, and of Sir Horace Plunkett’s book on the “Rural Life\r\nProblems of the United States.”\r\n\r\nOne feature of the problem should be recognized by the farmer at once,\r\nand an effort made to deal with it. It is our duty and our business to\r\nconsider the farm laborer exactly as we consider the farmer. No country\r\nlife can be satisfactory when the owners of farms tend, for whatever\r\nreason, to go away to live in cities instead of working their farms;\r\nand, moreover, it cannot be really satisfactory when the labor system is\r\nso managed that there is for part of the year a demand for labor which\r\ncannot be met, and during another part of the year no demand for labor\r\nat all, so that the farmers tend to rely on migratory laborers who come\r\nout to work in the country with no permanent interest in it and with no\r\nprospect of steady employment. It is exceedingly difficult to make a\r\ngood citizen out of a man who cannot count upon some steadiness and\r\ncontinuity in the work which means to him his livelihood. Economic\r\nconditions on the farm—in variety and kind of crop-growing, especially\r\nas distributed in time, and in housing for the men—must be so shaped as\r\nto render it possible for the man who labors for the farmer to be\r\nsteadily employed under conditions which foster his self-respect and\r\ntend for his development.\r\n\r\nAbove all, the conditions of farm life must always be shaped with a view\r\nto the welfare of the farmer’s wife and the farm laborer’s wife, quite\r\nas much as to the welfare of the farmer and the farm laborer. To have\r\nthe woman a mere drudge is at least as bad as to have the man a mere\r\ndrudge. It is every whit as important to introduce new machines to\r\neconomize her labor within the house, as it is to introduce machinery to\r\nincrease the effectiveness of his labor outside the house. I have not\r\nthe slightest sympathy with any movement which looks to excusing men and\r\nwomen for the non-performance of duty and fixes attention only on rights\r\nand not on duties. The woman who shirks her duty as housewife, as\r\nmother, is a contemptible creature; just as the corresponding man is a\r\ncontemptible creature. But the welfare of the woman is even more\r\nimportant than the welfare of the man; for the mother is the real Atlas,\r\nwho bears aloft in her strong and tender arms the destiny of the world.\r\nShe deserves honor and consideration such as no man should receive. She\r\nforfeits all claim to this honor and consideration if she shirks her\r\nduties. But the average American woman does not shirk them; and it is a\r\nmatter of the highest obligation for us to see that they are performed\r\nunder conditions which make for her welfare and happiness and for the\r\nwelfare and happiness of the children she brings into the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   The Progressives, Past and Present\r\n\r\n\r\nThere have been two great crises in our country’s history: first when it\r\nwas formed, and then again when it was perpetuated. The formative period\r\nincluded not merely the Revolutionary War, but the creation and adoption\r\nof the Constitution and the first dozen years of work under it. Then\r\ncame sixty years during which we spread across the continent—years of\r\nvital growth, but of growth without rather than growth within. Then came\r\nthe time of stress and strain which culminated in the Civil War, the\r\nperiod of terrible struggle upon the issue of which depended the\r\njustification of all that we had done earlier, and which marked the\r\nsecond great period of growth and development within. The name of John\r\nBrown will be forever associated with this second period of the Nation’s\r\nhistory; and Kansas was the theater upon which the first act of the\r\nsecond of our great National life dramas was played. It was the result\r\nof the struggle in Kansas which determined that our country should be in\r\ndeed as well as in name devoted to both union and freedom, that the\r\ngreat experiment of democratic government on a national scale should\r\nsucceed and not fail. It was a heroic struggle; and, as is inevitable\r\nwith all such struggles, it had also a dark and a terrible side. Very\r\nmuch was done of good, and much, also, of evil; and, as was inevitable\r\nin such a period of revolution, often the same man did both good and\r\nevil. For our great good fortune as a nation, we, the people of the\r\nUnited States as a whole, can now afford to forget the evil, or at least\r\nto remember it without bitterness, and to fix our eyes with pride on the\r\ngood that was accomplished. Even in ordinary times there are very few of\r\nus who do not see the problems of life as through a glass, darkly; and\r\nwhen the glass is clouded by the murk of furious popular passion, the\r\nvision of the best and the bravest is dimmed. Looking back, we are all\r\nof us now able to do justice to the valor and the disinterestedness and\r\nthe love of the right as to each it was given to see the right, shown\r\nboth by the men of the North and the men of the South in that contest\r\nwhich was finally decided by the attitude of the West. We can see the\r\nPuritan soldier, the man of the Bible and the sword, embodied again in\r\nStonewall Jackson, just as we see that Puritan embodied in the stern\r\nsoldiers who warred against Jackson. We can admire the heroic valor, the\r\nsincerity, the self-devotion shown alike by the men who wore the blue\r\nand the men who wore the gray; and our sadness that such men should have\r\nhad to fight one another is tempered by the glad knowledge that ever\r\nhereafter their descendants shall be found fighting side by side,\r\nstruggling in peace as well as in war for the uplift of their common\r\ncountry, all alike resolute to raise to the highest pitch of honor and\r\nusefulness the nation to which they all belong.\r\n\r\nI do not speak of this struggle of the past merely from the historic\r\nstandpoint. Our interest is primarily in the application to-day of the\r\nlessons taught by the contest of half a century ago. It is of little use\r\nfor us to pay lip loyalty to the mighty men of the past unless we\r\nsincerely endeavor to apply to the problems of the present precisely the\r\nqualities which in other crises enabled the men of that day to meet\r\nthose crises. It is half melancholy and half amusing to see the way in\r\nwhich well-meaning people gather to do honor to the men who, in company\r\nwith John Brown, and under the lead of Abraham Lincoln, faced and solved\r\nthe great problems of the nineteenth century, while at the same time\r\nthese same good people nervously shrink from or frantically denounce\r\nthose who are trying to meet the problems of the twentieth in the spirit\r\nwhich was accountable for the successful solution of the problems of\r\nLincoln’s time.\r\n\r\nJohn Brown stands to us now as representing the men and the generation\r\nwho rendered the greatest service ever rendered this country. He stood\r\nfor heroic valor, grim energy, fierce fidelity to high ideals. A great\r\ndebt is owed to John Brown because he is one of the most striking\r\nfigures in the mighty struggle which was to keep us forever a free and\r\nunited nation, which was to secure the continuance of the most\r\ntremendous democratic experiment ever tried. He did much in his life and\r\nmore in his death; he embodied the inspiration of the men of his\r\ngeneration; his fate furnished the theme of the song which most stirred\r\nthe hearts of the soldiers. John Brown’s work was brought to completion,\r\nwas made perfect, by the men who bore aloft the banner of the Union\r\nduring the four terrible years which intervened between Sumter and\r\nAppomattox. To the soldiers who fought through those years—and of course\r\nto a very few of their civilian chiefs, like Lincoln—is due the supreme\r\ndebt of the Nation. They alone, of all our people since we became a\r\nnation, rendered to us and to all who come after us a service literally\r\nindispensable. They occupy the highest and most honorable position ever\r\noccupied by any men of any generation in our country.\r\n\r\nOf that generation of men to whom we owe so much, the man to whom we owe\r\nmost is, of course, Lincoln. Valor, energy, disinterestedness,\r\nidealism—all these were his; and his also was that lofty and far-seeing\r\nwisdom which alone could make the valor, the disinterestedness, the\r\nenergy, the idealism, of service to the Republic. Here again, in meeting\r\nthe problems of to-day, let us profit by, and welcome, and co-operate\r\nwith the John Browns; but let us also remember that the problems can\r\nreally be solved only if we approach them in the spirit of Abraham\r\nLincoln.\r\n\r\nJohn Brown prepared the way; but if the friends of freedom and union had\r\nsurrendered themselves to his leadership, the cause of freedom and union\r\nwould have been lost. After his death Lincoln spoke of him as follows:\r\n\r\n“John Brown’s effort was peculiar. It was not a slave insurrection. It\r\nwas an attempt by white men to get up a revolt among slaves in which the\r\nslaves refused to participate. In fact, it was so absurd that the\r\nslaves, with all their ignorance, saw plainly enough it could not\r\nsucceed. That affair, in its philosophy, corresponds with the many\r\nattempts related in history at the assassination of kings and emperors.\r\nAn enthusiast broods over the oppression of a people till he fancies\r\nhimself commissioned by Heaven to liberate them. He ventures the\r\nattempt, which ends in little less than his own execution. Orsini’s\r\nattempt on Louis Napoleon and John Brown’s attempt at Harper’s Ferry\r\nwere, in their philosophy, precisely the same. The eagerness to cast\r\nblame on Old England in the one case and on New England in the other\r\ndoes not disprove the sameness of the two things.”\r\n\r\nIn our struggle to-day we can study Lincoln’s career purely as an\r\nexample to emulate; we can study John Brown’s career partly as such an\r\nexample, but partly also as a warning. I think such study is especially\r\nnecessary for the extremists among the very men with whom my own\r\nsympathy is especially keen. I am a progressive; I could not be anything\r\nelse; indeed, as the years go by I become more, and not less, radically\r\nprogressive. To my mind the failure resolutely to follow progressive\r\npolicies is the negation of democracy as well of progress, and spells\r\ndisaster. But for this very reason I feel concern when progressives act\r\nwith heedless violence, or go so far and so fast as to invite reaction.\r\nThe experience of John Brown illustrates the evil of the revolutionary\r\nshort-cut to ultimate good ends. The liberty of the slave was desirable,\r\nbut it was not to be brought about by a slave insurrection. The better\r\ndistribution of property is desirable, but it is not to be brought about\r\nby the anarchic form of Socialism which would destroy all private\r\ncapital and tend to destroy all private wealth. It represents not\r\nprogress, but retrogression, to propose to destroy capital because the\r\npower of unrestrained capital is abused. John Brown rendered a great\r\nservice to the cause of liberty in the earlier Kansas days; but his\r\nnotion that the evils of slavery could be cured by a slave insurrection\r\nwas a delusion analogous to the delusions of those who expect to cure\r\nthe evils of plutocracy by arousing the baser passions of workingmen\r\nagainst the rich in an endeavor at violent industrial revolution. And,\r\non the other hand, the brutal and shortsighted greed of those who profit\r\nby what is wrong in the present system, and the attitude of those who\r\noppose all effort to do away with this wrong, serve in their turn as\r\nincitements to such revolution; just as the insolence of the ultra\r\nproslavery men finally precipitated the violent destruction of slavery.\r\n\r\nIn one of Lincoln’s addresses immediately after his second election, at\r\na time when any man of less serene magnanimity would have been tempted\r\nto advocate extreme measures and to betray personal exultation, or even\r\nto show hatred of his opponents, he said:\r\n\r\n“Human nature will not change. In any future great national affair,\r\ncompared with the men of this, we shall have as weak and as strong, as\r\nsilly and as wise, as bad and as good. Let us therefore study the\r\nincidents of this as philosophy to learn wisdom from, and none of them\r\nas wrongs to be revenged. May not all having a common interest reunite\r\nin a common effort to save our common country? For my own part, I have\r\nstriven and shall strive to avoid placing any obstacle in the way. So\r\nlong as I have been here I have not willingly planted a thorn in any\r\nman’s bosom. May I ask those who have not differed with me to join with\r\nme in this same spirit towards those who have?”\r\n\r\nSurely such a union of indomitable resolution in the achievement of a\r\ngiven purpose, with patience and moderation in the policy pursued, and\r\nwith kindly charity and consideration and friendliness to those of\r\nopposite belief, marks the very spirit in which we of to-day should\r\napproach the pressing problems of the present.\r\n\r\nThese problems have to do with securing a more just and generally\r\nwidespread welfare, so that there may be a more substantial measure of\r\nequality in moral and physical well-being among the people whom the men\r\nof Lincoln’s day kept undivided as citizens of a single country, and\r\nfreed from the curse of negro slavery. They did their part; now let us\r\ndo ours.\r\n\r\nFundamentally, our chief problem may be summed up as the effort to make\r\nmen, as nearly as they can be made, both free and equal; the freedom and\r\nequality necessarily resting on a basis of justice and brotherhood. It\r\nis not possible, with the imperfections of mankind, ever wholly to\r\nachieve such an ideal, if only for the reason that the shortcomings of\r\nmen are such that complete and unrestricted individual liberty would\r\nmean the negation of even approximate equality, while a rigid and\r\nabsolute equality would imply the destruction of every shred of liberty.\r\nOur business is to secure a practical working combination between the\r\ntwo. This combination should aim, on the one hand, to secure to each man\r\nthe largest measure of individual liberty that is compatible with his\r\nfellows’ getting from life a just share of the good things to which they\r\nare legitimately entitled; while, on the other hand, it should aim to\r\nbring about among well-behaved, hard-working people a measure of\r\nequality which shall be substantial, and which shall yet permit to the\r\nindividual the personal liberty of achievement and reward without which\r\nlife would not be worth living, without which all progress would stop,\r\nand civilization first stagnate and then go backwards. Such a\r\ncombination cannot be completely realized. It can be realized at all\r\nonly by the application of the spirit of fraternity, the spirit of\r\nbrotherhood. This spirit demands that each man shall learn and apply the\r\nprinciple that his liberty must be used not only for his own benefit but\r\nfor the interest of the community as a whole, while the community in its\r\nturn, acting as a whole, shall understand that while it must insist on\r\nits own rights as against the individual, it must also scrupulously\r\nsafeguard these same rights of the individual.\r\n\r\nLincoln set before us forever our ideal when he stated that this country\r\nwas dedicated to a government of, by, and for the people. Our whole\r\nexperiment is meaningless unless we are to make this a democracy in the\r\nfullest sense of the word, in the broadest as well as the highest and\r\ndeepest significance of the word. It must be made a democracy\r\neconomically as well as politically. This does not mean that there shall\r\nnot be leadership in the economic as in the political world, or that\r\nthere shall not be ample reward for high distinction and great service.\r\nQuite the contrary. It is our boast that in our political affairs we\r\nhave combined genuine political equality with high distinction in\r\nindividual service. During a century and a third we here on this\r\ncontinent—more completely than anywhere else at any other time—have\r\nactually realized the democratic principle, the principle of popular\r\ngovernment. Yet during this period we have produced, in the persons of\r\nWashington and Lincoln, two leaders who on the roll of the world’s\r\nworthies stand higher than any other two men ever produced by any other\r\ncountry during a similar length of time. We believe that it is entirely\r\npossible to combine equality of rights and at least an approximate\r\nequality in the opportunity to achieve material well-being, with the\r\nopportunity for the highest kind of individual distinction. Hitherto our\r\nefforts towards this end have related to purely political matters; we\r\nmust now strive to achieve the same end in economic matters.\r\n\r\nTo achieve our purpose we cannot trust merely to haphazard, easy-going\r\nmethods with complete absence of official Government action and a too\r\nexclusively material standard. These did well enough in the pioneer days\r\nwhen problems were comparatively simple, and when the country was still\r\nso large that Uncle Sam could give every man a farm, so that, if any man\r\ndid not succeed where he was, all he had to do was to move somewhere\r\nelse. We must be true to the spirit of our ancestors, and therefore we\r\nmust avoid any servility to the letter of what they said and did. There\r\nmust be equal rights for all, and special privileges for none; but we\r\nmust remember that to achieve this ideal it is necessary to construe\r\nrights and privileges very differently from the way they were\r\nnecessarily construed, by statesmen and people alike, a century ago. We\r\nmust strive to achieve our ideal by an exercise of governmental power\r\nwhich the conditions did not render necessary a century ago, and of\r\nwhich our forefathers would have felt suspicious. This is no reflection\r\non the wisdom of our forefathers; it is simply an acknowledgment that\r\nconditions have now changed. If our farmers now used the wasteful\r\nmethods that served for their great-grandfathers, they would not merely\r\nfail in the present, but would work a grave wrong to the American\r\ncitizens of the future. In the same way we must apply new political\r\nmethods to meet the new political needs, or else we shall suffer, and\r\nour children also. In the same way, when we speak of the “square deal,”\r\nwe include two thoughts, each supplementary to the other. The square\r\ndeal can be secured in part by honest enforcement of existing laws, by\r\nhonest application of the principles upon which this Government was\r\nfounded, by the exercise of an aroused and enlightened public opinion.\r\nBut in order completely to secure it, there must be whatever legislation\r\nis necessary to meet the new conditions caused by the extraordinary\r\nindustrial change and development that have taken place during the last\r\ntwo generations. The greatest evils in our industrial system to-day are\r\nthose which rise from the abuses of aggregated wealth; and our great\r\nproblem is to overcome these evils and cut out these abuses. No one man\r\ncan deal with this matter. It is the affair of the people as a whole.\r\nWhen aggregated wealth demands what is unfair, its immense power can be\r\nmet only by the still greater power of the people as a whole, exerted in\r\nthe only way it can be exerted, through the Government; and we must be\r\nresolutely prepared to use the power of the Government to any needed\r\nextent, even though it be necessary to tread paths which are yet untrod.\r\nThe complete change in economic conditions means that governmental\r\nmethods never yet resorted to may have to be employed in order to deal\r\nwith them. We cannot tolerate anything approaching a monopoly,\r\nespecially in the necessaries of life, except on terms of such\r\nthoroughgoing governmental control as will absolutely safeguard every\r\nright of the public. Moreover, one of the most sinister manifestations\r\nof great corporate wealth during recent years has been its tendency to\r\ninterfere and dominate in politics.\r\n\r\nIt is not merely that we want to see the game played fairly. We also\r\nwant to see the rules changed, so that there shall be both less\r\nopportunity and less temptation to cheat, and less chance for some few\r\npeople to gain a profit to which either they are not entitled at all, or\r\nelse which is so enormous as to be greatly in excess of what they\r\ndeserve, even though their services have been great. We wish to do away\r\nwith the profit that comes from the illegitimate exercise of cunning and\r\ncraft. We also wish to secure a measurable equality of opportunity, a\r\nmeasurable equality of reward for services of similar value. To do all\r\nthis, two mutually supplementary movements are necessary. On the one\r\nhand, there must be—I think there now is—a genuine and permanent moral\r\nawakening, without which no wisdom of legislation or administration\r\nreally means anything; and, on the other hand, we must try to secure the\r\nsocial and economic legislation without which any improvement due to\r\npurely moral agitation is necessarily evanescent.\r\n\r\nWe pride ourselves upon being a practical people, and therefore we\r\nshould not be merely empirical in seeking to bring about results. We\r\nmust set the end in view as the goal; and then, instead of making a\r\nfetish of some particular kind of means, we should adopt whatever\r\nhonorable means will best accomplish the end. In so far as unrestricted\r\nindividual liberty brings the best results, we should encourage it. But\r\nwhen a point is reached where this complete lack of restriction on\r\nindividual liberty fails to achieve the best results, then, on behalf of\r\nthe whole people, we should exercise the collective power of the people,\r\nthrough the State Legislatures in matters of purely local concern, and\r\nthrough the National Legislature when the purpose is so big that only\r\nNational action can achieve it. There are good people who, being\r\ndiscontented with present-day conditions, think that these conditions\r\ncan be cured by a return to what they call the “principles of the\r\nfathers.” In so far as we have departed from the standards of lofty\r\nintegrity in public and private life to which the greatest men among the\r\nfounders of the Republic adhered, why, of course, we should return to\r\nthese principles. We must always remember that no system of legislation\r\ncan accomplish anything unless back of it we have the right type of\r\nNational character; unless we have ideals to which our practice\r\nmeasurably conforms. But to go back to the governmental theories of a\r\nhundred years ago would accomplish nothing whatever; for it was under\r\nthe conditions of unrestricted individualism and freedom from Government\r\ninterference, countenanced by those theories, that the trusts grew up,\r\nand private fortunes, enormous far beyond the deserts of the\r\naccumulators, were gathered. The old theories of government worked well\r\nin sparsely settled communities, before steam, electricity, and\r\nmachinery had revolutionized our industrial system; but to return to\r\nthem now would be as hopeless as for the farmers of the present to\r\nreturn to the agricultural implements which met the needs of their\r\npredecessors, the farmers who followed in the footsteps of Daniel Boone\r\nto Kentucky and Missouri. It may be that, in the past development of our\r\ncountry, complete freedom from all restrictions, and the consequent\r\nunlimited encouragement and reward given to the most successful\r\nindustrial leaders, played a part in which the benefits outweighed the\r\ndisadvantages. But nowadays such is not the case.\r\n\r\nLincoln had to meet special and peculiar problems, and therefore there\r\nwas no need and no opportunity for him to devote attention to those\r\nother problems which we face, and which in his day were so much less\r\nintense than in ours. Nevertheless, he very clearly put the proper\r\ndemocratic view when he said: “I hold that while man exists it is his\r\nduty to improve not only his own condition but to assist in ameliorating\r\nmankind.” And again: “Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital;\r\ncapital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed but for\r\nlabor. Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher\r\nconsideration. Capital has its rights which are as worthy of protection\r\nas any other rights.... Nor should this lead to a war upon the owners of\r\nproperty. Property is the fruit of labor; property is desirable; is a\r\npositive good in the world. Let not him who is houseless pull down the\r\nhouse of another, but let him work diligently and build one for himself,\r\nthus by example showing that his own shall be safe from violence when\r\nbuilt.” It seems to me that in these words Lincoln took substantially\r\nthe attitude that we ought to take; he showed the proper sense of\r\nproportion in his relative estimate of capital and labor, of human\r\nrights and property rights. Above all, in this speech, as in so many\r\nothers, he taught a lesson in wise kindliness and charity; an\r\nindispensable lesson to us of to-day, for if we approach the work of\r\nreform in a spirit of vindictiveness—in a spirit of reckless disregard\r\nfor the rights of others, or of hatred for men because they are better\r\noff than ourselves—we are sure in the end to do not good but damage to\r\nall mankind, and especially to those whose especial champions we profess\r\nourselves to be. Violent excess is sure to provoke violent reaction; and\r\nthe worst possible policy for our country would be one of violent\r\noscillation between reckless upsetting of property rights, and\r\nunscrupulous greed manifested under pretense of protecting those rights.\r\nThe agitator who preaches hatred and practices slander and\r\nuntruthfulness, and the visionary who promises perfection and\r\naccomplishes only destruction, are the worst enemies of reform; and the\r\nman of great wealth who accumulates and uses his wealth without regard\r\nto ethical standards, who profits by and breeds corruption, and robs and\r\nswindles others, is the very worst enemy of property, the very worst\r\nenemy of conservatism, the very worst enemy of those “business\r\ninterests” that only too often regard him with mean admiration and\r\nheatedly endeavor to shield him from the consequences of his iniquity.\r\n\r\nNow, the object we seek to achieve is twofold. A great democratic\r\ncommonwealth should seek to produce and reward that individual\r\ndistinction which results in the efficient performance of needed work,\r\nfor such performance is of high value to the whole community. But hand\r\nin hand with this purpose must go the purpose which Abraham Lincoln\r\ndesignated as the “amelioration of mankind.” Only by an intelligent\r\neffort to realize this joint process of individual and social betterment\r\ncan we keep our democracy sound. We all admit this to be true\r\npolitically; but we have not paid much heed to the question from its\r\neconomic side. The wage-earner primarily needs what it is pre-eminently\r\nto the interest of our democratic commonwealth that he should\r\nobtain—that is, a high standard of living, and the opportunity to\r\nacquire the means whereby to secure it. Every power of the Nation should\r\nbe used in helping him to this end; taking care, however, that the help\r\nshall be given in such fashion as to represent real help, and not harm;\r\nfor the worst injury that could be done him or any other man would be to\r\nteach him to rely primarily on “the State” instead of on himself. The\r\ncollective power of the State can help; but it is the individual’s own\r\npower of self-help which is most important.\r\n\r\nNow, I am well aware that demagogues and doctrinaire reformers of a\r\ncertain type may try to turn such use of the powers of the State into an\r\nabuse. We should set our faces like flint against any such abuse. We\r\nshould make it fully understood by the workingmen—by the men of small\r\nmeans—that we will do everything in our power for them _except what is\r\nwrong;_ but that we will do wrong for no man—neither for them nor for\r\nany one else. Nevertheless, the fact that there are dangers in following\r\na given course merely means that we should follow it with a cautious\r\nrealization of these dangers, and not that we should abandon it, if on\r\nthe whole it is the right course.\r\n\r\nIt is just so with personal liberty. The unlimited freedom which the\r\nindividual property-owner has enjoyed has been of use to this country in\r\nmany ways, and we can continue our prosperous economic career only by\r\nretaining an economic organization which will offer to the men of the\r\nstamp of the great captains of industry the opportunity and inducement\r\nto earn distinction. Nevertheless, we as Americans must now face the\r\nfact that this great freedom which the individual property-owner has\r\nenjoyed in the past has produced evils which were inevitable from its\r\nunrestrained exercise. It is this very freedom—this absence of State and\r\nNational restraint—that has tended to create a small class of enormously\r\nwealthy and economically powerful men whose chief object is to hold and\r\nincrease their power. Any feeling of special hatred toward these men is\r\nas absurd as any feeling of special regard. Some of them have gained\r\ntheir power by cheating and swindling, just as some very small business\r\nmen cheat and swindle; but, as a whole, big men are no better and no\r\nworse than their small competitors, from a moral standpoint. Where they\r\ndo wrong it is even more important to punish them than to punish a small\r\nman who does wrong, because their position makes it especially wicked\r\nfor them to yield to temptation; but the prime need is to change the\r\nconditions which enable them to accumulate a power which it is not for\r\nthe general welfare that they should hold or exercise, and to make this\r\nchange not only without vindictiveness, without doing injustice to\r\nindividuals, but also in a cautious and temperate spirit, testing our\r\ntheories by actual practice, so that our legislation may represent the\r\nminimum of restrictions upon the individual initiative of the\r\nexceptional man which is compatible with obtaining the maximum of\r\nwelfare for the average man. We grudge no man a fortune which represents\r\nmerely his own power and sagacity exercised with entire regard to the\r\nwelfare of his fellows. But the fortune must not only be honorably\r\nobtained and well used; it is also essential that it should not\r\nrepresent a necessary incident of widespread, even though partial,\r\neconomic privation. It is not even enough that the fortune should have\r\nbeen gained without doing damage to the community. We should only permit\r\nit to be gained and kept so long as the gaining and the keeping\r\nrepresent benefit to the community. This I know implies a policy of a\r\nfar more active governmental interference with social and economic\r\nconditions than we have hitherto seen in this country; but I think we\r\nhave to face the fact that such increase in governmental activity is now\r\nnecessary. We should work cautiously and patiently and with complete\r\nabsence of animosity, except toward the individuals whom we are certain\r\nhave been guilty of flagrant evil; but we should also work firmly to\r\nrealize the democratic purpose, economically and socially as well as\r\npolitically. We must make popular government responsible for the\r\nbetterment both of the individual and of society at large.\r\n\r\nLet me repeat once more that, while such responsible governmental action\r\nis an absolutely necessary thing to achieve our purpose, yet it will be\r\nworse than useless if it is not accompanied by a serious effort on the\r\npart of the individuals composing the community thus to achieve each for\r\nhimself a higher standard of individual betterment, not merely material\r\nbut spiritual and intellectual. In other words, our democracy depends on\r\nindividual improvement just as much as upon collective effort to achieve\r\nour common social improvement. The most serious troubles of the present\r\nday are unquestionably due in large part to lack of efficient\r\ngovernmental action, and cannot be remedied without such action; but\r\nneither can any remedy permanently avail unless back of it stands a high\r\ngeneral character of individual citizenship.\r\n\r\nThis governmental improvement can be accomplished partly by the States,\r\nin so far as any given evil affects only one State, or one or two\r\nStates; in so far as a merely local remedy is needed for a merely local\r\ndisease. But the betterment must be accomplished partly, and I believe\r\nmainly, through the National Government. I do not ask for\r\nover-centralization; but I do ask that we work in a spirit of broad and\r\nfar-reaching nationalism when we deal with what concerns our people as a\r\nwhole. I no more make a fetish of centralization than of\r\ndecentralization. Any given case must be treated on its special merits.\r\nEach community should be required to deal with all that is of merely\r\nlocal interest; and nothing should be undertaken by the Government of\r\nthe whole country which can thus wisely be left to local management. But\r\nthose functions of government which no wisdom on the part of the States\r\nwill enable them satisfactorily to perform must be performed by the\r\nNational Government. We are all Americans; our common interests are as\r\nbroad as the continent; the most vital problems are those that affect us\r\nall alike. The regulation of big business, and therefore the control of\r\nbig property in the public interest, are pre-eminently instances of such\r\nfunctions which can only be performed efficiently and wisely by the\r\nNation; and, moreover, so far as labor is employed in connection with\r\ninter-State business, it should also be treated as a matter for the\r\nNational Government. The National power over inter-State commerce\r\nwarrants our dealing with such questions as employers’ liability in\r\ninter-State business, and the protection and compensation for injuries\r\nof railway employees. The National Government of right has, and must\r\nexercise, its power for the protection of labor which is connected with\r\nthe instrumentalities of inter-State commerce.\r\n\r\nThe National Government belongs to the whole American people; and where\r\nthe whole American people are interested that interest can be\r\neffectively guarded only by the National Government. We ought to use the\r\nNational Government as an agency, a tool, wherever it is necessary, in\r\norder that we may organize our entire political, economical, and social\r\nlife in accordance with a far-reaching democratic purpose. We should\r\nmake the National governmental machinery an adequate and constructive\r\ninstrument for constructive work in the realization of a National\r\ndemocratic ideal. I lay emphasis upon the word _constructive_. Too often\r\nthe Federal Government, and above all the Federal judiciary, has\r\npermitted itself to be employed for purely negative purposes—that is, to\r\nthwart the action of the States while not permitting efficient National\r\naction in its place. From the National standpoint nothing can be\r\nworse—nothing can be full of graver menace—for the National life than to\r\nhave the Federal courts active in nullifying State action to remedy the\r\nevils arising from the abuse of great wealth, unless the Federal\r\nauthorities, executive, legislative, and judicial alike, do their full\r\nduty in effectually meeting the need of a thoroughgoing and radical\r\nsupervision and control of big inter-State business in all its forms.\r\nMany great financiers, and many of the great corporation lawyers who\r\nadvise them, still oppose any effective regulation of big business by\r\nthe National Government, because, for the time being, it serves their\r\ninterest to trust to the chaos which is caused on the one hand by\r\ninefficient laws and conflicting and often unwise efforts at regulation\r\nby State governments, and, on the other hand, by the efficient\r\nprotection against such regulation afforded by the Federal courts. In\r\nthe end this condition will prove intolerable, and will hurt most of all\r\nthe very class which it at present benefits. The continuation of such\r\nconditions would mean that the corporations would find that they had\r\npurchased immunity from the efficient exercise of Federal regulative\r\npower at the cost of being submitted to a violent and radical local\r\nsupervision, inflamed to fury by having repeatedly been thwarted, and\r\nnot chastened by exercised responsibility. To refuse to take, or to\r\npermit others to take, wise and practical action for the remedying of\r\nabuses is to invite unwise action under the lead of violent extremists.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to see the Nation forced into ownership of the railways if\r\nit can possibly be avoided; and the only alternative is thoroughgoing\r\nand effective regulation, which shall be based on full knowledge of all\r\nthe facts, including a physical valuation of the property, the details\r\nof its capitalization, and the like. We should immediately set about\r\nsecuring this physical valuation. The Government should oversee the\r\nissuance of all stocks and bonds, and should have complete power over\r\nrates and traffic agreements. The railways are really highways, and it\r\nis the fundamental right of the people as a whole to see that they are\r\nopen to use on just and reasonable terms, equal to all persons. The\r\nHepburn Bill marked a great step in advance; the law of last session, in\r\nits final shape and as actually passed, marks, on the whole, another\r\ndecided step in advance.\r\n\r\nCorporate regulation is merely one phase of a vast problem. The true\r\nfriend of property, the true conservative, is he who insists that\r\nproperty shall be the servant and not the master of the commonwealth;\r\nwho insists that the creature of man’s making shall be the servant and\r\nnot the master of the man who made it. The citizens of the United States\r\nmust effectively control the mighty commercial forces which they have\r\nthemselves called into being.\r\n\r\nCorporations are necessary to the effective use of the forces of\r\nproduction and commerce under modern conditions. We cannot effectively\r\nprohibit all combinations without doing far-reaching economic harm; and\r\nit is mere folly to do as we have done in the past—to try to combine\r\nincompatible systems—that is, to try both to prohibit and regulate\r\ncombinations. Combinations in industry are the result of an imperative\r\neconomic law which cannot be repealed by political legislation. The\r\neffort at prohibiting all combination has substantially failed. The only\r\ncourse left is active corporate regulation—that is, the control of\r\ncorporations for the common good—the suppression of the evils that they\r\nwork, and the retention, as far as may be, of that business efficiency\r\nin their use which has placed us in the forefront of industrial peoples.\r\nI need waste no words upon our right so to control them. The corporation\r\nis the creature of government, and the people have the right to handle\r\nit as they desire; all they need pay attention to is the expediency of\r\nrealizing this right in some way that shall be productive of good and\r\nnot harm. The corporate manager who achieves success by honest\r\nefficiency in giving the best service to the public should be favored\r\nbecause we all benefit by his efficiency. He realizes Abraham Lincoln’s\r\ndefinition which I have quoted above, because he works for his own\r\nmaterial betterment and at the same time for the “amelioration of\r\nmankind,” and he should be helped by the Government because his success\r\nis good for the National welfare. But a man who grasps and holds\r\nbusiness power by breaking the industrial efficiency of others, who wins\r\nsuccess by methods which are against the public interest and degrading\r\nto the public morals, should not be permitted to exercise such power.\r\nInstead of punishing him by a long and doubtful process of the law after\r\nthe wrong has been committed, there should be such effective Government\r\nregulation as to check the evil tendencies at the moment that they start\r\nto develop. Overcapitalization in all its shapes is one of the prime\r\nevils; for it is one of the most fruitful methods by which unscrupulous\r\nmen get improper profits, and when the holdings come into innocent hands\r\nwe are forced into the uncomfortable position of being obliged to reduce\r\nthe dividends of innocent investors, or of permitting the public and the\r\nwage-workers, either or both, to suffer. Such really effective control\r\nover great inter-State business can come only from the National\r\nGovernment. The American people demands the new Nationalism needful to\r\ndeal with the new problems; it puts the National need above sectional or\r\npersonal advantage; it is impatient of the utter confusion which results\r\nfrom local legislatures attempting to treat National issues as local\r\nissues; it is still more impatient of the National impotence which\r\nsprings from the over-division of governmental powers; the impotence\r\nwhich makes it possible for local selfishness, or for the vulpine legal\r\ncunning which is hired by wealthy special interests, to bring National\r\nactivities to a deadlock.\r\n\r\nThe control must be exercised in several different ways. It may be that\r\nNational incorporation is not at the moment possible; but there must be\r\nsome affirmative National control, on terms which will secure publicity\r\nin the affairs of and complete supervision and control over the big,\r\nNation-wide business corporations; a control that will prevent and not\r\nlegalize abuses. Such control should imply the issuance of securities by\r\ncorporations only under thoroughgoing Governmental supervision, and\r\nafter compliance with Governmental requirements which shall effectually\r\nprevent overcapitalization. Such control should protect and favor the\r\ncorporation which acts honestly, exactly as it should check and punish,\r\nwhen it cannot prevent, every species of dishonesty.\r\n\r\nIn the Inter-State Commerce Commission and in the Federal Bureau of\r\nCorporations we have bodies which, if their powers are sufficiently\r\nenlarged after the right fashion, can render great and substantial\r\nservice. The average American citizen should have presented to him in a\r\nsimple and easily comprehended form the truth about the business affairs\r\nthat affect his daily life as consumer, employee, employer, as investor,\r\nas voter. The issue of securities should be subject to rigorous\r\nGovernment supervision. There are concrete instances of unfair\r\ncompetition that can be reached under the Federal criminal legislation,\r\nand they should be attacked and destroyed in the courts. But the laws\r\nshould be such that normally, and save in extraordinary circumstances,\r\nthere should be no need of recourse to the courts. What is needed is\r\nadministrative supervision and control. This should be so exercised that\r\nthe highways of commerce and opportunity should be open to all; and not\r\nnominally open, but really open, a consistent effort being made to\r\ndeprive every man of any advantage that is not due to his own\r\nsuperiority and efficiency, controlled by moral purpose. The National\r\nBureau of Corporations has not been given the powers or the funds to\r\ndevelop its full usefulness, and yet it offers one of the prime means at\r\nthe disposal of the people of keeping them fully acquainted with all the\r\nfacts about corporation control. We have a right to expect from this\r\nBureau and from the Inter-State Commerce Commission a very high grade of\r\npublic service. We should be as sure of the proper conduct of\r\ninter-State railways and the proper management of inter-State business\r\nas we are now sure of the conduct and management of the National banks,\r\nand we should have as effective supervision in one case as in the other.\r\n\r\nNot only as a matter of justice and honesty, but as a matter of prime\r\npopular interest, we should see that this control is so exercised as to\r\nfavor a proper return to the upright business manager and honest\r\ninvestor. In the matter of railway rates, for instance, it is just as\r\nmuch our duty to see that they are not too low as that they are not too\r\nhigh. We must preserve the right of the railway employee to proper wages\r\nand the right of the investor to proper interest as scrupulously as we\r\npreserve the right of the shipper and the producer and the consumer. We\r\ncannot afford to do injustice, or suffer it to be done, to any of these.\r\nBut in order to do justice we must have full knowledge. We must have the\r\nright to find out every fact connected with the business of the railway,\r\nso as to base our judgment, not on any one fact, but on all taken\r\ntogether. Inasmuch as it is so often impossible to punish wrongs done in\r\nthe past, and to prevent the consequences of the wrongs thus committed\r\nbeing felt by one innocent class, without shifting the burden to the\r\nshoulders of another innocent class, we ought to provide that hereafter\r\nbusiness shall be carried on from its inception in such a way as to\r\nprevent swindling. Incidentally, this will also tend to prevent that\r\nexcessive profit by one man, which may not be swindling, under existing\r\nlaws, but which nevertheless is against the interest of the\r\ncommonwealth; To know all the facts is of as much interest to the\r\ninvestor and the wageworker as to the shipper, the producer, the\r\nconsumer. Full knowledge of the past helps us in dealing with the\r\nfuture. If we find that high rates are due to overcapitalization in the\r\npast, or to any kind of sharp practice in the past, then, whether or not\r\nit is possible to take action which will partly remedy the wrong, we are\r\ncertainly in a better position to prevent a repetition of the wrong.\r\n\r\nLet me, in closing, put my position in a nutshell. When I say that I am\r\nfor the square deal, I mean not merely that I stand for fair play under\r\nthe present rules of the game, but that I stand for having these rules\r\nchanged so as to work for a more substantial equality of opportunity and\r\nof reward for equally good service. So far as possible, the reward\r\nshould be based upon service; and this necessarily implies that where a\r\nman renders us service in return for the fortune he receives, he has the\r\nright to receive it only on terms just to the whole people. For this\r\nreason there should be a heavily progressive National inheritance tax on\r\nbig fortunes. The really big fortune, by the mere fact of its size,\r\nacquires qualities which differentiate it in kind as well as in degree\r\nfrom what is possessed by men of relatively small means. A heavily\r\nprogressive inheritance tax on all such fortunes (heaviest on absentees)\r\nhas the good qualities of an income tax, without its drawbacks; it is\r\nfar more beneficial to the community at large, and far less burdensome\r\nto private individuals, as well as far more easily collected. A\r\nmoderate, but progressive, income tax, carefully devised to fall\r\ngenuinely on those who ought to pay, would, I believe, be a good thing;\r\nbut a heavy and heavily progressive inheritance tax on great fortunes\r\nwould be a far better thing.\r\n\r\nI have tried to set before you my creed. I believe in property rights,\r\nbut I believe in them as adjuncts to, and not as substitutes for, human\r\nrights. I believe that normally the rights of property coincide with the\r\nrights of man; but where they do not, then the rights of man must be put\r\nabove the rights of property. I believe in shaping the ends of\r\ngovernment to protect property; but wherever the alternative must be\r\nfaced, I am for man and not for property. I am far from underestimating\r\nthe importance of dividends, but I rank dividends below human character.\r\nI know well that if there is not sufficient prosperity the people will\r\nin the end rebel against any system, no matter how exalted morally; and\r\nreformers must not bring upon the people permanent economic ruin, or the\r\nreforms themselves will go down in the ruin. But we must be ready to\r\nface any temporary disaster—whether or not brought on by those who will\r\nwar against us to the knife—if only through such disaster can we attain\r\nour goal. And those who oppose all reform will do well to remember that\r\nruin in its worst form is inevitable if our National life brings us\r\nnothing whatever but a swollen and badly distributed material\r\nprosperity. In other words, I feel that material interests are chiefly\r\ngood, not in themselves, but as an indispensable foundation upon which\r\nwe should build a higher superstructure, a superstructure without which\r\nthe foundation becomes worthless. Therefore I believe that the destinies\r\nof this country should be shaped primarily by moral forces, and by\r\nmaterial forces only as they are subordinated to these moral forces. I\r\nbelieve that material wealth is an exceedingly valuable servant, and a\r\nparticularly abhorrent master, in our National life. I think one end of\r\ngovernment should be to achieve prosperity; but it should follow this\r\nend chiefly to serve an even higher and more important end—that of\r\npromoting the character and welfare of the average man. In the long run,\r\nand inevitably, the actual control of the government will be determined\r\nby the chief end which the government subserves. If the end and aim of\r\ngovernment action is merely to accumulate general material prosperity,\r\ntreating such prosperity as an end in itself and not as a means, then it\r\nis inevitable that material wealth and the masters of that wealth will\r\ndominate and control the course of national action. If, on the other\r\nhand, the achievement of material wealth is treated, not as an end of\r\ngovernment, but as a thing of great value, it is true—so valuable as to\r\nbe indispensable—but of value only in connection with the achievement of\r\nother ends, then we are free to seek through our government, and through\r\nthe supervision of our individual activities, the realization of a true\r\ndemocracy. Then we are free to seek not only the heaping up of material\r\nwealth, but a wise and generous distribution of such wealth so as to\r\ndiminish grinding poverty, and, so far as may be, to equalize social and\r\neconomic no less than political opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe people as a whole can be benefited morally and materially by a\r\nsystem which shall permit of ample reward for exceptional efficiency,\r\nbut which shall nevertheless secure to the average man who does his work\r\nfaithfully and well, the reward to which he is entitled. Remember that I\r\nspeak only of the man who does his work faithfully and well. The man who\r\nshirks his work, who is lazy or vicious, or even merely incompetent,\r\ndeserves scant consideration; we may be sorry for his family, but it is\r\nfolly to waste sympathy on the man himself; and it is also folly for\r\nsentimentalists to try to shift the burden of blame from such a man\r\nhimself to “society;” and it is an outrage to give him the reward given\r\nto his hard-working, upright, and efficient brother. Still less should\r\nwe waste sympathy on the criminal; there are altogether too many honest\r\nmen who need it; and one chief point in dealing with the criminal should\r\nbe to make him understand that he will be in personal peril if he\r\nbecomes a lawbreaker. I realize entirely that in the last analysis, with\r\nthe nation as with the individual, it is private character that counts\r\nfor most. It is because of this realization that I gladly lay myself\r\nopen to the charge that I preach too much, and dwell too much upon moral\r\ncommonplaces; for though I believe with all my heart in the\r\nnationalization of this Nation—in the collective use on behalf of the\r\nAmerican people of the governmental powers which can be derived only\r\nfrom the American people as a whole—yet I believe even more in the\r\npractical application by the individual of those great fundamental\r\nmoralities.\r\n\r\nA certain type of rather thinly intellectual man sneers at these\r\nmoralities as “commonplaces;” and base and evil men, selfish and\r\nshortsighted men, are immensely pleased to see them denounced and\r\nderided. Yet surely it is the duty of every public man to try to make\r\nall of us keep in mind, and practice, the moralities essential to the\r\nwelfare of the American people. It is of vital concern to the American\r\npeople that the men and women of this great Nation should be good\r\nhusbands and wives, fathers and mothers, sons and daughters; that we\r\nshould be good neighbors, one to another, in business and in social\r\nlife; that we should each do his or her primary duty in the home without\r\nneglecting the duty to the State; that we should dwell even more on our\r\nduties than on our rights; that we should work hard and faithfully; that\r\nwe should prize intelligence, but prize courage and honesty and\r\ncleanliness even more. Inefficiency is a curse; and no good intention\r\natones for weakness of will and flabbiness of moral, mental, and\r\nphysical fiber; yet it is also true that no intellectual cleverness, no\r\nability to achieve material prosperity, can atone for the lack of the\r\ngreat moral qualities which are the surest foundation of national might.\r\nIn this great free democracy it behooves all the people so to bear\r\nthemselves that, not with their lips only but in their lives, they shall\r\nshow their fealty to the great truth pronounced of old—the truth that\r\nRighteousness exalteth a nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                The Pioneer Spirit and American Problems\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a number of years I have believed and urged the principles I set\r\nforth in the following article. Their presentation here is in substance\r\nwhat I said in three recent speeches at Cheyenne, Denver, and Omaha.\r\n\r\nThe men who have made this great republic what it is, and especially the\r\nmen who have turned it into a continental commonwealth, have possessed\r\nin the highest degree the great virile virtues of strength, courage,\r\nenergy, and undaunted and unwavering resolution. Their typical\r\nleaders—of whom Abraham Lincoln, though the most exceptional, was the\r\nmost typical—have possessed keen intelligence, and a character not\r\nmerely strong but lofty, a character exalted by the fact that great\r\npower was accompanied by a high and fine determination to use this great\r\npower for the common good, for the advancement of mankind. Such men were\r\nthe builders of New England. As the country grew, such men were the\r\npioneers that pushed the frontiers of civilization westward. A hundred\r\nyears ago, when men spoke of the West, they meant the country between\r\nthe Alleghanies and the Mississippi. Fifty years ago the white man’s\r\nWest took in Minnesota, Iowa, and Kansas, and then skipped across to\r\nCalifornia and Oregon. The country of the great plains and the Rockies\r\nhas grown up within my own lifetime. I myself saw and took part in the\r\nclosing years of the pioneer period, and it was my great privilege to\r\nwork side by side with the pioneers—the ranchmen, the miners, the\r\ncow-punchers, the mule-skinners, the bull-whackers—who actually opened\r\nup the country. I now travel in every comfort on railways across lands\r\nwhich, when I first rode across them, were still the home of the Indian\r\nand the buffalo; and I find cities where one can obtain not merely\r\ncomfort but luxury, in the places where, thirty years ago, there was not\r\na building beyond a log hut or a ’dobe house. The men who did this work\r\nwere engaged in the final stages of conquering the continent; and it was\r\ntheir privilege to do one of the great works of all time, to do their\r\npart in the performance of an epic feat in the history of the progress\r\nof mankind.\r\n\r\nThe pioneer days are over, save in a few places; and the more complex\r\nlife of to-day calls for a greater variety of good qualities than were\r\nneeded on the frontier. There is need at present to encourage the\r\ndevelopment of new abilities which can be brought to high perfection\r\nonly by a kind of training useless in pioneer times; but these new\r\nqualities can only supplement, and never supplant, the old, homely\r\nvirtues; the need for the special and distinctive pioneer virtues is as\r\ngreat as ever. In other words, as our civilization grows older and more\r\ncomplex, while it is true that we need new forms of trained ability, and\r\nneed to develop men whose lives are devoted wholly to the pursuit of\r\nspecial objects, it is yet also true that we need a greater and not a\r\nless development of the fundamental frontier virtues.\r\n\r\nThese qualities, derived from the pioneers, were not confined to the\r\npioneers. They are shown in the deeds of the Nation; and especially in\r\nthe two great feats which during the past decade have made the deepest\r\nimpression abroad—the cruise of the battle fleet around the world, and\r\nthe digging of the Panama Canal.\r\n\r\nNow, there is no use of a nation claiming to be a great nation, unless\r\nit is prepared to play a great part. A nation such as ours cannot\r\npossibly play a great part in international affairs, cannot expect to be\r\ntreated as of weight in either the Atlantic or the Pacific, or to have\r\nits voice as to the Monroe Doctrine or the management of the Panama\r\nCanal heeded, unless it has a strong and thoroughly efficient navy. So\r\nfar from this increase in naval strength representing on our part either\r\na menace of aggression to weaker nations or a menace of war to stronger\r\nnations, it has told most powerfully for peace. No nation regarded the\r\ncruise as fraught with any menace of hostility to itself; and yet every\r\nnation accepted it as a proof that we were not only desirous ourselves\r\nto keep the peace, but able to prevent the peace being broken at our\r\nexpense. No cruise in any way approaching it has ever been made by any\r\nfleet of any other Power; and the best naval opinion abroad had been\r\nthat no such feat was possible; that is, that no such cruise as that we\r\nactually made could be undertaken by a fleet of such size without\r\ninnumerable breakdowns and accidents. The success of the cruise,\r\nperformed as it was without a single accident, immeasurably raised the\r\nprestige, not only of our fleet, but of our Nation; and was a distinct\r\nhelp to the cause of international peace.\r\n\r\nAs regards the Panama Canal, I really think that outside nations have a\r\njuster idea than our own people of the magnitude and success of the\r\nwork. Six years ago last spring the American Government took possession\r\nof the Isthmus. The first two years were devoted to the sanitation of\r\nthe Isthmus, to assembling the plant and working force, and providing\r\nquarters, food, and water supplies. In all these points the success was\r\nextraordinary. From one of the plague-spots of the globe, one of the\r\nmost unhealthy regions in the entire world, the Isthmus has been turned\r\ninto a singularly healthy place of abode. Active excavation on a large\r\nscale did not begin until January, 1907. Three years and a half have\r\ngone by since then, and three-fifths of the total excavation has already\r\nbeen accomplished. In 1908 and 1909 the monthly average of rock and\r\nearth removed was three million cubic yards, notwithstanding the fact\r\nthat nine months of each year constituted a season of very heavy\r\nrainfall; but it is impossible to maintain such a ratio as the depth\r\nincreases. Still, it is certain that such a rate can be maintained as\r\nwill enable the workers to finish the excavation considerably in advance\r\nof the date fixed for opening the Canal—January 1, 1915. Indeed, I shall\r\nbe surprised if the Canal cannot be opened six months or even a year in\r\nadvance of the time set. The work has two great features: The Culebra\r\nCut, which I have been considering, and the great dam at Gatun. The\r\nconstruction of the dam has advanced sufficiently to convince the\r\nengineers in charge of the work of its absolute stability and\r\nimperviousness. The engineer in charge has announced that all the\r\nconcrete in all the locks will be in place two years hence.\r\n\r\nThis is a stupendous record of achievement. As a people we are rather\r\nfond of criticising ourselves, and sometimes with very great justice;\r\nbut even the most pessimistic critic should sometimes think of what is\r\nto our credit. Among our assets of the past ten years will be placed the\r\nextraordinary ability, integrity, and success with which we have handled\r\nall the problems inherited as the result of the Spanish War; the way we\r\nhave handled ourselves in the Philippines, in Cuba, in Porto Rico, in\r\nSan Domingo, and in Panama. The cruise of the battle fleet around the\r\nworld was a striking proof that we had made good with the navy; and what\r\nwe have done at Panama represents the accomplishment of one of the great\r\nfeats of the ages. It is a feat which reflects the highest honor upon\r\nour country; and our gratitude is due to every man who has taken an\r\nhonorable part in any capacity in bringing it about.\r\n\r\nThe same qualities that have enabled Americans to conquer the\r\nwilderness, and to attempt tasks like the building of the Panama Canal\r\nand the sending of the battle fleet around the world, need to be applied\r\nnow to our future problems; and these qualities, which include the power\r\nof self-government, together with the power of joining with others for\r\nmutual help, and, what is especially important, the feeling of\r\ncomradeship, need to be applied in particular to that foremost of\r\nNational problems, the problem of the preservation of our National\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nThe question has two sides. In the first place, the actual destruction,\r\nor, if this is not possible, at any rate the needless waste, of the\r\nnatural resources must be stopped. In the second place, so far as\r\npossible, these resources must be kept for the use of the whole people,\r\nand not handed over for exploitation to single individuals or groups of\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nThe first point I shall not here discuss at length. It is rapidly\r\nbecoming a well-settled policy of this people that we of the present\r\ngeneration hold the land in part as trustees for the next generation,\r\nand not exclusively for our own selfish enjoyment. Just as the farmer is\r\na good citizen if he leaves his farm improved and not impaired to his\r\nchildren, and a bad citizen if he cares nothing for his children and\r\nskins the land and destroys its value in his own selfish interest; so\r\nthe Nation behaves well if it treats the soil and the water and the\r\nforests as assets which it must turn over to the next generation\r\nincreased and not impaired in value, and behaves badly if it leaves the\r\nland poorer to those who come after us. No farm should be so used that\r\nthe soil is permitted to depreciate in value; no forest so used as\r\npermanently to impair its productivity.\r\n\r\nThe second part of the question relates to preserving and using our\r\nnatural resources in the interest of the public as a whole. We do not\r\nintend to discourage individual excellence by improperly diminishing the\r\nreward for that individual excellence; on the contrary, our desire is to\r\nsee that the fullest reward is given to the men of exceptional\r\nabilities, up to the point when the abilities are used to the detriment\r\nof the people as a whole. We favor the sheep man who feeds his sheep on\r\nhis own range in such manner that the range increases instead of\r\ndiminishes in value; and we are against the big man who does not live in\r\nthe country at all, but who sends migratory bands of sheep with a few\r\nhired shepherds to wander over it, destroying pasturage and forests, and\r\nseriously impairing the value of the country for actual settlers. We are\r\nfor the liberty of the individual up to, but not beyond, the point where\r\nit becomes inconsistent with the welfare of the community as a whole.\r\n\r\nNow, to preserve the general welfare, to see to it that the rights of\r\nthe public are protected, and the liberty of the individual secured and\r\nencouraged as long as consistent with this welfare, and curbed when it\r\nbecomes inconsistent therewith, it is necessary to invoke the aid of the\r\nGovernment. There are points in which this governmental aid can best be\r\nrendered by the States; that is, where the exercise of States’ rights\r\nhelps to secure popular rights, and as to these I believe in States’\r\nrights. But there are large classes of cases where only the authority of\r\nthe National Government will secure the rights of the people, and where\r\nthis is the case I am a convinced and a thoroughgoing believer in the\r\nrights of the National Government. Big business, for instance, is no\r\nlonger an affair of any one State; big business has become nationalized;\r\nand the only effective way of controlling and directing it, and\r\npreventing abuses in connection with it, is by having the people\r\nnationalize this control in order to prevent their being exploited by\r\nthe individuals who have nationalized the business. All commerce on a\r\nscale sufficiently large to warrant any control over it by Government is\r\nnowadays inter-State or foreign commerce; and until this fact is\r\nheartily acknowledged, in particular by both courts and legislative\r\nbodies, National and State alike, the interest of the people will\r\nsuffer.\r\n\r\nTake the question of the control of the water power sites. The enormous\r\nimportance of water power sites to the future industrial development of\r\nthis country has only been realized within a very few years.\r\nUnfortunately, the realization has come too late as regards many of the\r\npower sites, but many yet remain with which our hands are free to deal.\r\nWe should make it our duty to see that hereafter the power sites are\r\nkept under the control of the general Government for the use of the\r\npeople as a whole. The fee should remain with the people as a whole,\r\nwhile the use is leased on terms which will secure an ample reward to\r\nthe lessees, which will encourage the development and use of the water\r\npower, but which will not create a permanent monopoly or permit the\r\ndevelopment to be anti-social, to be in any respect hostile to the\r\npublic good.\r\n\r\nIn this country, nowadays, capital has a National and not a State use.\r\nThe great corporations which are managed and largely owned in the older\r\nStates are those which are most in evidence in developing and using the\r\nmines and water powers and forests of the new Territories and new\r\nStates, from Alaska to Arizona. I have been genuinely amused during the\r\npast two months at having arguments presented to me on behalf of certain\r\nrich men from New York and Ohio, for instance, as to why Colorado and\r\nother Rocky Mountain States should manage their own water power sites.\r\nNow I am sure that those men, according to their lights, are good\r\ncitizens; but, naturally enough, their special interest obscures their\r\nsense of the public need; and as their object is to escape efficient\r\ncontrol, they clamor to be put under the State instead of under the\r\nNation. If we are foolish enough to grant their requests, we shall have\r\nourselves to blame when we wake up to find that we have permitted\r\nanother privilege to intrench itself, and another portion of what should\r\nbe kept for the public good to be turned over to individuals for\r\npurposes of private enrichment.\r\n\r\nOur people have for many years proceeded upon the assumption that the\r\nNation controls the public land. The coal should be kept for the people,\r\nand those who mine it should pay part of the profit back to the people.\r\n\r\nRemember also that many of the men who protest loudly against effective\r\nNational action would be the first to turn round and protest against the\r\nState action if such action in its turn became effective, and would then\r\nunhesitatingly invoke the law to show that the State had no\r\nConstitutional power to act. I am a strong believer in efficient\r\nNational action; and if there is one thing which I abhor more than\r\nanother, it is the creation by legislative, by executive, or by judicial\r\naction of a neutral ground in which neither the State nor the Nation has\r\npower, and which can serve as a place of refuge for the lawless man, and\r\nespecially for the lawless man of great wealth, who can hire the best\r\nlegal counsel to advise him how to keep his abiding-place equally\r\ndistant from the uncertain frontier of both State and National power.\r\n\r\nLet me illustrate what I mean by a reference to two concrete cases. The\r\nfirst is the decision of the United States Supreme Court in the Knight\r\nSugar Trust case. This was really a decision rendering it exceedingly\r\ndifficult for the people to devise any method of controlling and\r\nregulating the business use of great capital in inter-State commerce. It\r\nwas a decision nominally against National rights, but really against\r\npopular rights, against the democratic principle of government by the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe second case is the so-called New York Bake-Shop case. In New York\r\nCity, as in most large cities, the baking business is likely to be\r\ncarried on under unhygienic conditions, conditions which tell against\r\nthe welfare of the workers, and therefore against the welfare of the\r\ngeneral public. The New York Legislature passed, and the New York\r\nGovernor signed, a bill remedying these improper conditions. New York\r\nState was the only body that could deal with them; the Nation had no\r\npower whatever in the matter. Acting on information which to them seemed\r\nample and sufficient; acting in the interest of the public and in\r\naccordance with the demand of the public, the only governmental\r\nauthority having affirmative power in the matter, the Governor and the\r\nLegislature of New York, took the action which they deemed necessary,\r\nafter what inquiry and study were needed to satisfy them as to the\r\nconditions and as to the remedy. The Governor and the Legislature alone\r\nhad the power to remedy the abuse. But the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates possessed, and unfortunately exercised, the negative power of not\r\npermitting the abuse to be remedied. By a five to four vote they\r\ndeclared the action of the State of New York unconstitutional. They\r\nwere, of course, themselves powerless to make the remotest attempt to\r\nprovide a remedy for the wrong which undoubtedly existed, and their\r\nrefusal to permit action by the State did not confer any power upon the\r\nNation to act. In effect, it reduced to impotence the only body which\r\ndid have power, so that in this case the decision, although nominally\r\nagainst State rights, was really against popular rights, against the\r\ndemocratic principle of government by the people under the forms of law.\r\n\r\nIf such decisions as these two indicated the Court’s permanent attitude,\r\nthere would be real and grave cause of alarm; for such decisions, if\r\nconsistently followed up, would upset our whole system of popular\r\nGovernment. I am, however, convinced, both from the inconsistency of\r\nthese decisions with the tenor of other decisions, and furthermore from\r\nthe very fact that they are in such flagrant and direct contradiction to\r\nthe spirit and needs of the time, that sooner or later they will be\r\nexplicitly or implicitly reversed. I mention them merely to illustrate\r\nthe need of having a truly National system of government under which the\r\npeople can deal effectively with all problems, meeting those that affect\r\nthe people as a whole by affirmative Federal action, and those that\r\nmerely affect the people of one locality by affirmative State action.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with future problems like this one of Conservation, we need\r\nto keep in mind the lesson taught by the American pioneer. It is a\r\nlesson that is to be found in the fact that the pioneer is so good an\r\nAmerican. He is an American, first and foremost. The man of the West\r\nthroughout the successive stages of Western growth has always been one\r\nof the two or three most typical figures, indeed I am tempted to say the\r\nmost typical figure, in American life; and no man can really understand\r\nour country, and appreciate what it really is and what it promises,\r\nunless he has the fullest and closest sympathy with the ideals and\r\naspirations of the West.\r\n\r\nThe great lesson that all of us need to learn and to keep is the lesson\r\nthat it is unimportant whether a man lives North or South, East or West,\r\nprovided that he is genuinely and in good faith an American; that he\r\nfeels every part of the United States as his own, and that he is\r\nhonestly desirous to uphold the interests of all other Americans in\r\nwhatever sections of the country they may dwell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       The Tariff: A Moral Issue\r\n\r\n\r\nWhenever men just like ourselves—probably not much better, and certainly\r\nno worse—continually fail to give us the results we have a right to\r\nexpect from their efforts, we may just as well make up our minds that\r\nthe fault lies, not in their personality, but in the conditions under\r\nwhich they work, and profit comes, not from denouncing them, but in\r\nseeing that the conditions are changed. This is especially true of\r\ntariff-making. It has been conclusively shown, by experiments repeated\r\nagain and again, that the methods of tariff-making by Congress, which\r\nhave now obtained for so many years, cannot, from the very nature of the\r\ncase, bring really satisfactory results. I think that the present tariff\r\nis better than the last, and considerably better than the one before the\r\nlast; but it has certainly failed to give general satisfaction. I\r\nbelieve this country is fully committed to the principle of protection;\r\nbut it is to protection as a principle; to protection primarily in the\r\ninterest of the standard of living of the American workingman. I believe\r\nthat when protection becomes, not a principle, but a privilege and a\r\npreference—or, rather, a jumble of privileges and preferences—then the\r\nAmerican people disapprove of it. Now, to correct the trouble, it is\r\nnecessary, in the first place, to get in mind clearly what we want, and,\r\nin the next place, to get in mind clearly the method by which we hope to\r\nobtain what we want. What we want is a square deal in the tariff as in\r\neverything else; a square deal for the wage-earner; a square deal for\r\nthe employer; and a square deal for the general public. To obtain it we\r\nmust have a thoroughly efficient and well-equipped tariff commission.\r\n\r\nThe tariff ought to be a material issue and not a moral issue; but if\r\ninstead of a square deal we get a crooked deal, then it becomes very\r\nemphatically a moral issue. What we desire in a tariff is such measure\r\nof protection as will equalize the cost of production here and abroad;\r\nand as the cost of production is mainly labor cost, this means primarily\r\na tariff sufficient to make up for the difference in labor cost here and\r\nabroad. The American public wants the American laboring man put on an\r\nequality with other citizens, so that he shall have the ability to\r\nachieve the American standard of living and the capacity to enjoy it;\r\nand to do this we must see that his wages are not lowered by improper\r\ncompetition with inferior wage-workers abroad—with wage-workers who are\r\npaid poorly and who live as no Americans are willing to live. But the\r\nAmerican public does not wish to see the tariff so arranged as to\r\nbenefit primarily a few wealthy men.\r\n\r\nAs a means toward the attainment of its end in view we have as yet\r\ndevised nothing in any way as effective as a tariff commission. There\r\nshould be a commission of well-paid experts; men who should not\r\nrepresent any industry; who should be masters of their subjects; of the\r\nvery highest character; and who should approach the matter with absolute\r\ndisregard of every outside consideration. These men should take up in\r\nsuccession each subject with which the tariff deals and investigate the\r\nconditions of production here and abroad; they should find out the facts\r\nand not merely accept the statements of interested parties; and they\r\nshould report to Congress on each subject as soon as that subject has\r\nbeen covered. Then action can be taken at once on the particular subject\r\nconcerned, while the commission immediately proceeds to investigate\r\nanother. By these means log-rolling would be avoided and each subject\r\ntreated on its merits, while there would be no such shock to general\r\nindustry as is implied in the present custom of making sweeping changes\r\nin the whole tariff at once. Finally, it should be the duty of some\r\nGovernmental department or bureau to investigate the conditions in the\r\nvarious protected industries, and see that the laborers really are\r\ngetting the benefit of the tariff supposed to be enacted in their\r\ninterest. Moreover, to insure good treatment abroad we should keep the\r\nmaximum and minimum provision.\r\n\r\nThe same principle of a first-class outside commission should be applied\r\nto river and harbor legislation. At present a river and harbor bill,\r\nlike a tariff bill, tends to be settled by a squabble among a lot of big\r\nselfish interests and little selfish interests, with scant regard to the\r\none really vital interest, that of the general public. In this matter\r\nthe National Legislature would do well to profit by the example of\r\nMassachusetts. Formerly Massachusetts dealt with its land and harbor\r\nlegislation just as at Washington tariff and river and harbor laws have\r\nbeen dealt with; and there was just the same pulling and hauling, the\r\nsame bargaining and log-rolling, the same subordination of the general\r\ninterest to various special interests. Last year Governor Draper took up\r\nthe matter, and on his recommendation the Legislature turned the whole\r\nbusiness over to a commission of experts; and all trouble and scandal\r\nforthwith disappeared. Incidentally, this seems to me to be a\r\nfirst-class instance of progressive legislation.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n 1.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks."
