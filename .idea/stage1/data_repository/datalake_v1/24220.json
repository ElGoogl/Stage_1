Six thousand feet above the valley\r\nfloor green and orange slopes run to the edges of perennial\r\nice-fields, while farther away, and peering above these almost\r\ninaccessible defences, like tents of besieging Titans, rise three\r\ngreat mountains gleaming with snow and thunderous with storms.\r\nAltogether a stage worthy of some colossal drama rather than the calm\r\nslumber of a forgotten hamlet.\r\n\r\nThe railway enters the valley from the south by sinuously following\r\nthe windings of a rushing, foam-white stream, and for many miles the\r\nengines cautiously feel their way among stupendous walls, passing\r\nhaltingly over bridges hung perilously between perpendicular cliffs by\r\nslender iron rods, or creep like mountain-cats from ledge to ledge,\r\nso that when they have reached safe harbor beside the little red depot\r\nthey never fail to pant and wheeze like a tired, gratified dog beside\r\nhis master's door. Aside from the coming and going of these trains,\r\nthe town is silent as the regarding pines.\r\n\r\nThe only other ways of entrance to this deep pocket lie over\r\nthreadlike trails which climb the divide from Silver City and Toltec\r\nand Vermilion, and loop their terrifying courses down the declivities\r\ntrod only by the sturdy burro or the agile, sure-footed\r\nmountain-horse. These wavering paths, worn deep and dusty once, are\r\ngrass-grown now, for they were built in the days when silver was\r\naccounted a precious metal, and only an occasional hunter or\r\nprospector makes present use of them.\r\n\r\nColorow itself, once a flaming, tumultuous centre of miners, gamblers,\r\nand social outcasts, is now risen (or declined) to the quiet of a New\r\nEngland summer resort, supported partly by two or three big mines\r\n(whose white ore is streaked with gold), but more and more by the\r\ngrowing fame of its mountains and their medicinal springs, for these\r\nsplendid peaks have their waters, hot and cold and sweet and bitter,\r\nwhose healing powers are becoming known to an ever-growing number of\r\nthose Americans who are minded to explore their native land.\r\n\r\nThis centre of aërial storms, these groups of transcendent summits,\r\nwould be more widely known still, but for the singular sense of\r\nproprietorship with which each discoverer regards them. The lucky\r\ntraveller who falls into this paradise is seized with a certain\r\ninstant jealousy of it, and communicates his knowledge only to his\r\nfamily and his friends. Nevertheless, its fame spreads slowly, and\r\neach year new discoverers flock in growing numbers to the one little\r\nhotel and its ramshackle bath-house, so that the community once\r\nabsolutely and viciously utilitarian begins to take timid account of\r\nits aesthetic surroundings, and here and there a little log-cabin (as\r\nappropriate to this land as the chalet to the Alps) is built beside\r\nthe calling ripples of the river, while saddled horses, laden burros\r\nin long lines, and now and then a vast yellow or red ore-wagon\r\ncreaking dolefully as it descends, still give evidence of the mining\r\nwhich goes on far up the zigzag trails towards the soaring, shining\r\npeaks of the Continental Divide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE MAID ON THE MOUNTAIN-SIDE\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day in July a fair young girl, with beautiful gray eyes, sat\r\nmusingly beside one of these southern trails gazing upon the inverted\r\npyramid of red sky which glowed between the sloping shoulders of the\r\nwestward warding peaks. Her exquisite lips, scarlet as strawberry\r\nstains, were drawn into an expression of bitter constraint, and her\r\nbrows were unnaturally knit. Her hat lay beside her on the ground, her\r\nbrown hair was blowing free, and in her eyes was the look of one\r\nlonging for the world beyond the hills. She appeared both lonely and\r\ndesolate.\r\n\r\nIt was a pity to see one so young and so comely confronting with sad\r\nand sullen brow such aërial majesty as the evening presented. It was,\r\nindeed, a sort of impiety, and the girl seemed at last to feel this.\r\nHer frowning brow smoothed out, her lips grew more girlish of line,\r\nand at length, rapt with wonder, she fixed her eyes on a single purple\r\ncloud which was dissolving, becoming each moment smaller, more remote,\r\nlike a fleeing eagle, yet burning each instant with even more dazzling\r\nflame of color than before--hasting as if to overtake the failing day.\r\nA dream of still fairer lands, of conquest, and of love, swept over\r\nher--became mirrored in her face. She had at this moment the wistful\r\ngaze which comes to the eyes of the young when desire of the future is\r\nstrong.\r\n\r\nUpon her musings a small sound broke, so faint, so far, she could not\r\ntell from whence it came nor what its cause might be. It might have\r\nbeen the rattle of a pebble under the feet of a near-by squirrel or\r\nthe scrambling rush of a distant bear. A few moments later the voice\r\nof a man--very diminished and yet unmistakable--came pulsing down the\r\nmountain-side.\r\n\r\nThe girl rose as lightly, as gracefully as a fawn who, roused but not\r\naffrighted, stands on her imprint in the grass and waits and listens.\r\n\r\nThe man or men--for another voice could now be heard in answer--came\r\nrapidly on, and soon a couple of men and a small pack-train came out\r\nof a clump of thick trees at the head of a gulch, and, doubling\r\nbackward and forward, descended swiftly upon the girl, who stood, with\r\nsome natural curiosity, to let the travellers, whoever they might be,\r\npass and precede her down to the valley. She resented them, for the\r\nreason that they cut short her reverie, her moment of spiritual peace.\r\n\r\nThe man who first appeared was a familiar type of the West, a small,\r\nlean, sharp-featured, foxy-eyed mountaineer, riding gracefully yet\r\nwearily--the natural horseman and trailer. Behind him two tired\r\nhorses, heaped with a camp outfit, stumbled, with low-hanging heads,\r\nwhile at the rear, sitting his saddle sturdily rather than with\r\ngrace, rode a young man bareheaded, but otherwise in the\r\nrough-and-ready dress of a plainsman. His eyes were on the sunset\r\nalso, and something in the manner of his beard, as well as in the\r\npoise of his head, proclaimed him to be the master of the little\r\ntrain, a man of culture and an alien.\r\n\r\nAt sight of the girl he smiled and bowed with a look of frank and most\r\nrespectful admiration, quite removed from the impudent stare of his\r\nguide. His hands were gloved, he wore a neat shirt, and his tie was in\r\norder--so much the girl saw as he faced her--and as he passed she\r\napprehended something strong and manly in the lines of his back and\r\nshoulders. Plainly he was not to the saddle born, like the man ahead,\r\nand yet he was quite as bronzed and travel-worn.\r\n\r\nA turn in the trail brought them both close under her feet, and again\r\nthe man in the rear glanced up at the figure poised on the bowlder\r\nabove him, and his eyes glowed once more with pleasure. There was in\r\nhis look an expression of acknowledged kinship, as of one refined soul\r\nto another, a kind of subtle flattery which pleased while it puzzled\r\nthe girl. Men with eyes of that appeal were not common in her world.\r\n\r\nThe bitter look vanished out of her face. She gazed after the trailer\r\nwith the unabashed interest of a child, wondering who he might be. In\r\nthat instant her soul, impressionable and eager, received and\r\nretained, like a sensitive plate, every line of his figure, every\r\nminute modelling of his face--even his fashion of saddle and the\r\nleather of his gun-case remained with her as food for reflection, and\r\nas she loitered down the trail a wish to know more about him rose in\r\nher heart. There was a kind of smiling ecstasy on his face before he\r\nsaw her--as if he, too, were transported by the scene, and this\r\nexpression came at last to be the chief revelation of his character.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: \"THERE WAS IN HIS LOOK AN EXPRESSION OF\r\n   ACKNOWLEDGED KINSHIP\"]\r\n\r\nThe red went out of the sky. The golden eagle of cloud flew home over\r\nthe illimitable seas of saffron, the purple shadows rose in the\r\nvalleys, the lights of the town began to sparkle. Engine-bells clanged\r\nto and fro, and the strains of a saloon band rose to vex the girl's\r\npoetic soul with repugnant remembrances of the dance-hall. \"I suppose\r\nhe is only camping through,\" she thought, a little wistfully,\r\nreferring back to the stranger. \"I wish I knew who he is.\"\r\n\r\nAs she came down to the level of the stream its friendly roar cut off\r\nthe ribald music and the clamor of the engines precisely as the bank\r\nshut away the visible town, leaving the little row of pretty cottages\r\nin the ward of the mountains and the martial, ranked, and towering\r\nfirs.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the trail a gray-haired woman met her. It was her\r\nmother, disturbed, indignant. \"Viola Lambert, what do you mean by\r\nstaying up there after dark? I'm all a-tremble over you.\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't dark, mother,\" answered the girl; \"and if it were, it isn't\r\nthe first time I've been out alone.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lambert's voice softened. \"Child, I can hardly see your face!\r\nYou must not do such things. I don't mind your being out on horseback,\r\nbut you must not go up there afoot. It is dangerous with all these\r\ntramp miners coming and going.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, don't scold--I'm here safe and sound.\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't had such a turn for years, Viola,\" the mother explained, as\r\nthey waited side by side along the narrow walk. \"I had an\r\n_impression_--so vivid--that I dropped my work and ran to find you. It\r\nwas just as if you called me, asking for help. It seemed to me that\r\nsome dreadful thing had happened to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But nothing did. I went up to see the sunset. I didn't meet a soul.\"\r\nShe ended abruptly, for she did not wish to retrace her sad reverie.\r\n\r\n\"Who were the two men who came down just now? They must have passed\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they passed me--I didn't know them. The one behind looked like\r\nan 'expert.' Perhaps he has come to examine the San Luis mine. Some\r\none said they were expecting a man from England.\"\r\n\r\n\"He looked more like a Frenchman to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"It may be he is,\" answered Viola, restrainedly.\r\n\r\nThey turned in at a rustic gateway opening into the yard of a small\r\nand very pretty log-cabin which seemed a toy house, so minute was it\r\nin contrast to the mighty, fir-decked wall of gray and yellow rock\r\nbehind it. Flowers had been planted along the path, and through the\r\nopen door a red-shaded lamp shone like a poppy. Plainly it was the\r\nhome of refined and tasteful women, a place where tall, rude men\r\nentered timidly and with apologies.\r\n\r\n\"Was there any mail?\" asked the girl, as she put aside her hat.\r\n\r\n\"Not a thing.\"\r\n\r\nThe shadow deepened on her small, sensitive face. \"Oh, why _don't_ the\r\ngirls write? they should know how horribly lonely it is here. I'm\r\ntired of everything to-day, mother--perfectly stone-blue. I don't like\r\nwhat I am; I'm tired of church-work and the people here. I want to go\r\nback East; I want to change my life completely.\"\r\n\r\nThe mother, a handsome woman, with fresh, unlined face, made no reply\r\nto this outburst. \"Gusta won't be back until late; we will have to get\r\nour own supper.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl seemed rather pleased at this opportunity to do something,\r\nand went to her work cheerfully, moving with such grace and lightness\r\nthat the mother stood in doting admiration to watch her; she was so\r\ntall and lithe and full-bosomed--her one treasure.\r\n\r\nAs she worked, the shadow again lifted from the girl's face, a smile\r\ncame back to her scarlet lips, and she sang underbreath as only a\r\nyoung maiden can sing to whom love is a wonder and marriage a far-off\r\ndream.\r\n\r\nShe recalled the look which lay on the face of the man who was riding\r\nwith bared head in ecstasy of the scene above and below him; but, most\r\nof all, she dwelt upon the gracious and candid glance of admiration\r\nwith which he greeted her and which he repeated as he disappeared\r\nbelow her to be seen no more.\r\n\r\nThis look went with her to her room, and as she sat at her window,\r\nwhich opened upon the river, she wondered whether he had gone into\r\ncamp in the pine groves just below the bridge, or whether he had taken\r\nlodgings at the hotel.\r\n\r\nShe had lovers--no girl of her charm could move without meeting the\r\nadmiring glances of men; but this stranger's regard was so much more\r\nsubtly exalting--it held an impersonal quality--it went beyond her\r\nentire understanding, adding an element of mystery to herself, to him,\r\nand to the sunset.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the young tourist had alighted before the door of the\r\nprincipal hotel, and, after writing his name in a clear and precise\r\nhand on the book in the office, had hastened to his supper, carrying a\r\nmost vivid recollection of the slender figure and flushed and speaking\r\nface of the girl on the trail. That moment of meeting, accidental and\r\nfleeting, had already become a most beautiful climax of his\r\npilgrimage. \"She was born of the sunset; she does not really exist,\"\r\nhe said, with unwonted warmth of phrase. \"How could this little mining\r\ntown produce so exquisite a flower?\"\r\n\r\nHis grosser needs supplied, he lit his big student's pipe and went out\r\nupon the upper story of the hotel's rude porch, and there sat,\r\nlistening to the rush of the stream, while the great yellow stars\r\nappeared one by one above the lofty peaks, and the air grew crisp to\r\nfrostiness. He was profoundly at peace with the world and himself, his\r\nphysical weariness being just sufficient to give this hour a sound\r\ncompleteness of content.\r\n\r\nAs the beauty of the night deepened, the girl's beauty allured like\r\nthe moon. He still sought to explain her. \"She is some traveller like\r\nmyself,\" he said, \"Bret Harte to the contrary, notwithstanding, the\r\nwilderness does not produce maids of her evident refinement and grace.\r\nShe comes of a long line of well-bred people.\"\r\n\r\nHe was not an emotional person, and had not been permitted to consider\r\npleasure the chief object, even of a vacation, but he went to his bed\r\nthat night well pleased with Colorow, and with a half-defined sense\r\nthat this was, after all, the point towards which his long journey,\r\nwith all its windings, had really tended. However, he was not ready to\r\nacknowledge that a large part of the charm of the place was due to the\r\nglamour of a slender maid lit by the sunset light.\r\n\r\nThis delight in the town and its surroundings gained a new quality\r\nnext morning as he looked from his window upon a single white cloud\r\nresting like a weary swan on the keen point of old Kanab. Though the\r\nmesas of New Mexico and the deserts of Arizona were his special field,\r\nhe bared his head to the charm of \"the high country.\"\r\n\r\nEach summer, after months of prolonged peering into the hidden heart\r\nof microscopic things in his laboratory (he was both analytical\r\nchemist and biologist), it was his custom to return for a few weeks to\r\nhuge, crude synthetic, nature for relief. After endless discussion of\r\n\"whorls of force\" and of \"the office of germs in the human organism,\"\r\nhe enjoyed the racy vernacular of the plainsman, to whom bacteria\r\nwere as indifferent as blackberry-seeds. Each year he resolved to go\r\nto the forest, to the lake regions, or to the mountains; but as the\r\nday of departure drew near the desert and the strange peoples living\r\nthereon reasserted their dominion, and so he had continued to return\r\nto the sand, to the home of the horned toad and the rattlesnake. These\r\ntrips restored the sane balance of his mind. To camp in the chaparral,\r\nto explore the source of streams, and to relive the wonder of the boy\r\nkept his faculties alert and keen.\r\n\r\nHis love of the sands and the purple buttes of the plain did not blind\r\nhim to the beauty of coloring and the gracious majesty of these peaks,\r\nclothed as they were with the russet and gold and amber of ripened\r\ngrasses, which grew even to the very summits (only the kingliest of\r\nthe peaks were permitted to wear the ermine robes which denoted\r\nsovereignty); the Continental Divide was, indeed, much more impressive\r\nthan he had expected it to be.\r\n\r\nHe was not one of those who seek out strange women, and he had no hope\r\nof meeting the girl of the mountain-side again. He was content to have\r\nher remain a poem--a song of the sunset--a picture seen only for a\r\nmoment, yet whose impression outlasts iron. Everything in nature had\r\nconverged to make her momentous. His long stay among the ugly, dusky\r\nwomen of the desert, his exultant joy in the mountain sunset, and his\r\nabounding health (which filled his heart with the buoyancy of a\r\nboy)--all these causes combined to revive emotions which his absorption\r\nin scientific investigation had set in the background--emotions which\r\nconcern the common man, but which the deeply ambitious chemist, eager\r\nto discover the chemical molecular structure of the plasm, must put\r\naside with a firm hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nA SECOND MEETING\r\n\r\n\r\nViola was just leaving her mother's gate the following afternoon when\r\na man's voice, cordial, assured, and cultivated, startled her.\r\n\r\n\"Good-morning. Is this your home?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked up to meet the smiling eyes of the stranger horseman. Again\r\nan indefinable charm of manner robbed his greeting of offence, and\r\nquite composedly she replied:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, this is our home.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a view you have, and what music!\" He indicated the river which\r\nran white and broad over its pebbles, just below the walk. \"I am\r\nenchanted with the place. I think you must love it very much.\"\r\n\r\nHer face expressed a qualified assent. \"Oh yes, but I get tired of it\r\nsometimes, especially in winter when we are all shut in with snow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you really are a year-round resident? I suppose my view _is_ the\r\ntourist's view. I can't believe anybody lives here in winter. I hope\r\nyou won't mind my introducing myself\"--he handed her a card. \"You made\r\nsuch a pretty picture up there beside the trail yesterday that I\r\ncouldn't forbear speaking to you on a second meeting. I wanted to\r\nknow whether you were real or just a fragment of sunset cloud.\"\r\n\r\nThe ease and candor of his manner, joined to the effect of the name on\r\nthe card, fully reassured her, and she looked up with a smile. \"Won't\r\nyou come in and rest?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, I should like particularly to do so, I've been for a climb\r\nup that peak behind your cottage and I'm tired.\"\r\n\r\nHer reserve quite melted, the girl led the way to the door where her\r\nmother stood in artless wonder.\r\n\r\n\"Mother, this is Dr. Serviss, of Corlear College.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad to know you, sir,\" said Mrs. Lambert, with old-fashioned\r\nformality. \"Won't you come in?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. It will be a pleasure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you a physician?\" she asked, as she took his hat and stick.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear, no! Nothing so useful as that. I'm a doctor by brevet, as\r\nthey say in the army.\" Then, as though acknowledging that his hostess\r\nwas entitled to know a little more about her intrusive guest, he\r\nadded: \"I am a student of biology, Mrs. Lambert, and assistant to Dr.\r\nWeissmann, the head of the bacteriological department of Corlear\r\nMedical College. We study germs--microscopic 'bugs,'\" he ended, with\r\nhumorous glance at Viola. \"What a charming bungalow you have here! Did\r\nyou gather those wild flowers?\"\r\n\r\nViola answered in the tone of a pupil to her master, \"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"But some of them grow high. You must be a mountaineer. Pardon my\r\ncuriosity--it is inexcusable--but how long have you lived here?\"\r\n\r\nThe mother looked at her daughter for confirmation. \"Eight years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you are from the East?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, from Wisconsin.\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed. \"_We_ call Wisconsin a Western State. Of course, it's the\r\nignorant prejudice of the New-Yorker, but I find it hard to think of\r\nyou as actual residents of this far-away little town. I thought only\r\nminers lived here?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are miners. My husband has a mine up in the Basin, but he's\r\nputting in some new machinery just now and is unable to come down but\r\nonce a week.\" Then mildly resenting his implied criticism of the town,\r\nshe added: \"We have just as nice people here as you'll find anywhere.\"\r\n\r\nHe responded gallantly, \"I am quite prepared to believe that, Mrs.\r\nLambert. But do many nice people like you live here all the year\r\nround?\" He was bent on drawing the girl out, but she did not respond.\r\n\r\nThe mother answered: \"I haven't been away except to take my daughter\r\nEast to school.\"\r\n\r\nHe was cautious. \"By East you mean Milwaukee?\"\r\n\r\n\"Diamond Lake, Wisconsin.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned to the girl. \"How long were you away?\"\r\n\r\n\"Four years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you like it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very much.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the reason you find it lonesome here.\" Up to this moment his\r\nattitude was that of a teacher towards a pretty pupil. \"You miss your\r\nclassmates, I suppose? Still there must be diversions here, even for a\r\nyoung girl.\"\r\n\r\nThe mother sighed. \"It really is very lonesome here for Viola--if it\r\nweren't for her church work and her music I don't know what she'd do.\r\nThere are so few young people, and then her years at the seminary\r\nspoiled her for the society out here, anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"So much the worse for Colorow society,\" laughed Serviss. Then, to\r\nclear the shadow which had gathered on the girl's face, he said: \"I\r\nsee a fine piano, and shelves of music books. This argues that you\r\nlove music. Won't you sing for me? I am hungry for a song.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not sing,\" she replied, coldly, \"I have no voice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then play for me. I have been for eight weeks on the desert and I am\r\nfamishing for music.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you a musician?\" asked Mrs. Lambert.\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, only a music-lover.\"\r\n\r\n\"My daughter is passionately fond of the piano,\" the mother explained,\r\n\"and her teachers advised her to go on and make a specialty of it.\r\nThey recommended Boston, but Viola wants to go to New York. She wanted\r\nto go last year, but I couldn't let her go. I'd been without her for\r\nfour years, and Mr. Lambert's affairs wouldn't permit us both to go,\r\nand so she had to stay; but it _does_ seem too bad for one as gifted\r\nas she is to give it up.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment Serviss changed his entire attitude towards these\r\npeople. They were too genuine, too trustful, and too fine to permit of\r\nany patronization, and the girl's dignified silence and the charm of\r\nher pellucid eyes and rose-leaf lips quite transmuted him from the\r\ncurious onlooker to the friend. \"I can understand your dilemma,\" he\r\nsaid, with less of formal cheer and more of genuine sympathy. \"And\r\nyet, if your daughter has most decided talent it is only fair to give\r\nher a chance to show what she can do.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl flushed and her eyes fell as the mother bent towards her\r\nvisitor.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you would listen to her play, Dr. Serviss, and tell me what\r\nyou think of her talent.\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes shone with humor. \"I will listen with great pleasure; but\r\ndon't ask a chemist to judge a pianist. I love music--it is a sweet\r\nnoise in my ears--but I can hardly distinguish Chopin from Schumann.\"\r\nHe faced the girl. \"Play for me. I shall be very deeply indebted.\" As\r\nshe still hesitated he added: \"Please do, or I will certainly think\r\nyou consider me intrusive.\"\r\n\r\nAs Viola slowly rose, Mrs. Lambert said: \"You must not feel that way,\r\nDr. Serviss. We are highly honored to entertain one so eminent as you\r\nare. I was brought up to value learning. Play for him, Viola.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the reason for her reluctance?\" Serviss asked himself. \"Is it\r\nshyness? Or does she resent me?\"\r\n\r\nWith a glance of protest at her mother the girl took her seat at the\r\npiano. \"I will try,\" she said, bluntly. \"But I know I shall fail.\"\r\n\r\nTwice she laid her hands upon the keys only to snatch them away again\r\nas if they were white-hot metal, and Serviss fancied her cheek grew\r\npale. The third time she clashed out a few jarring chords intermixed\r\nwith quite astonishing roulade on the treble--an unaccountable\r\ninterruption, as if a third hand had been thrust in to confuse her.\r\nShe stopped, and he began to share her embarrassment.\r\n\r\nShe tried again, shaking her head determinedly from side to side as if\r\nto escape some invisible annoying object. It seemed as if some mocking\r\nsprite in the instrument were laboring to make her every harmony a\r\ndiscord, and Serviss keenly regretted his insistence.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she sprang up with an impatient, choking cry. \"I can't do it!\r\nHe won't let me!\" she passionately exclaimed, and rushed from the room\r\nleaving her visitor gazing with pity and amazement into the face of\r\nthe mother, who seemed troubled but in no wise astounded by her\r\ndaughter's hysterical action. She sat in silence--a painful silence,\r\nas if lacking words to express her thought; and Serviss rose, rebuked,\r\nand for the first time ill at ease.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, Mrs. Lambert; I didn't intend to embarrass your\r\ndaughter.\"\r\n\r\n\"She is very nervous--\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand. Being a complete stranger, I should not have insisted.\r\nOne of the best singers I ever knew was so morbidly shy that on the\r\nplatform she was an absolute failure. Her vocal chords became so\r\ncontracted that she sang quite out of tune, and yet among friends she\r\nwas magnificent.\"\r\n\r\nThe mother's voice was quite calm. \"It was not your fault, sir.\r\nSometimes she's this way, even when her best friends ask her to play.\r\nThat's why I fear she will never be able to perform in concerts--she\r\nis _liable_ to these break-downs.\"\r\n\r\nHe was puzzled by something concealed in the mother's tone, and pained\r\nand deeply anxious to restore the peaceful charm of the home into which\r\nhe had, in a sense, unbiddenly penetrated. \"I am guilty--unpardonably\r\nguilty. I beg you to tell her that my request was something more than\r\npolite seeming--I was sincerely eager to hear her play. Perhaps at\r\nanother time, when she has come to know me better, she will feel like\r\ntrying again. I don't like to think that our acquaintance has ended\r\nthus--in discord. May I not come in again, now that I am, in a sense,\r\nexplained?\"\r\n\r\nHe blundered on from sentence to sentence, seeking to soften the\r\nstern, straight line on the mother's lips--a line of singular\r\nrepression, sweet but firm.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you _would_ come again. I should really like your advice about\r\nViola's future. Can't you come in this evening?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be very glad to do so. At what hour?\"\r\n\r\n\"At eight. Perhaps she will be able to play for you then.\"\r\n\r\nWith a feeling of having blundered into a most unpleasant predicament,\r\nthrough a passing interest in a pretty girl, Serviss retreated to his\r\nhotel across the river.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nPUPIL AND MASTER\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce out of the spell of the immediate presence of this troubled\r\nmother and her appealing daughter, Serviss began to doubt and to\r\nquestion. \"They are almost too simple, too confiding. Why should Mrs.\r\nLambert, at a first meeting, accidental and without explanation, ask\r\nme to take thought of her daughter's future?\" The fact that his\r\nconnection with an institution of learning gave him a sort of sanctity\r\nin their eyes did not weigh with him. He was of those who take\r\nprofessorships in the modern way--with levity, either real or assumed.\r\n\r\n\"I think, on the whole, I'd better keep out of this family\r\ncomplication, whatever it may be,\" he concluded. \"This absence of the\r\nhusband in the hills may be more significant than at present\r\nappears--it may be a voluntary sequestration. I take the hint. I am\r\nnot seeking new responsibilities, and I don't care to act as adviser,\r\neven to a pretty girl--especially _not_ to a pretty girl.\" And he\r\nwaved his hand in the manner of one declining a doubtful cigar.\r\n\r\nBut this slim young witch, with the scarlet lips and pleading gray\r\neyes, was not so easily banished. His inward eye dwelt upon her with\r\nincreasing joy, \"How beautiful she was, as she stood there on that\r\nbowlder! Perhaps she was posing? She is now at the very height of her\r\ngirlish charm. What an appeal she must make to the men of this\r\nregion--those exquisite lips--that pliant waist--that full bosom!\r\nThere is some antagonism between mother and daughter--something more\r\nthan appears on the surface. She is both sullen and hysterical. What a\r\npity!\"\r\n\r\nShe continued to trouble him as he sat again after his evening meal on\r\nthe veranda of the hotel. He could hear the slow tramp of heavy boots\r\nalong the sidewalks beneath him, and the roar of the Colorow, softened\r\nby distance, rose and fell like a drowsy tune. On the highest peaks\r\nthe after-glow still lingered, and from one of the little cottages\r\ndeep in the shadow across the stream a light appeared like a signal,\r\nan invitation, and, the blood in him being young, accepted the lure.\r\nHe rose with the impulse. \"I'm going! Why not? 'Tis a night for\r\nadventure. There's no need of involving myself in any wise with their\r\nfuture. I'm an outsider, and will take precious good care to stay so.\"\r\nHis face was impassive, but his heart was quick within him as he set\r\nfoot on the bridge. \"Perhaps this is my Rubicon?\" he said, and paused\r\nwith a moment's irresolution.\r\n\r\nHis doubt, his suspicion, instantly vanished as he re-entered the\r\npretty little sitting-room and faced the sweet-visaged mother, who\r\ntacitly acknowledged her daughter as the cause of his coming by\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n\"Viola has just stepped over to the parsonage. She will return in a\r\nmoment. Won't you please be seated?\"\r\n\r\nServiss took a chair, quite ready--even eager--to listen to the\r\nfurther confidences which he perceived his hostess was about to give\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you won't think it strange, professor--\"\r\n\r\nHe interrupted her. \"Please don't call me professor.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, sir. I understood that you were a professor in a\r\nuniversity.\"\r\n\r\nShe seemed disappointed, and he explained: \"It's true I am in the\r\nhand-book as a member of the faculty, and I plead guilty to the degree\r\nof doctor of philosophy--_that_ I am proud of; but to be called\r\nprofessor robs me of my young humanity.\" This humorous explanation\r\nseemed to confuse her, and he added, kindly and naturally: \"Really,\r\nMrs. Lambert, I am a chemist and experimentalist in biology. I have no\r\nclass-room work, because the college prefers to have me make what they\r\ncall 'original investigation.' And, pray, let me say that while I am\r\nvery willing to assist your daughter, or to advise you in any way, I\r\nsee very little of musical New York. My work confines me to my 'shop'\r\nvery closely, and when I go out I associate almost wholly with my\r\npeculiar kind. However, I can easily secure information as to the best\r\nschools of music, for I have several friends who know all about it. I\r\ninterrupted you--please continue.\"\r\n\r\nThis pleasant, straightforward speech restored her confidence. \"I\r\nthink I was about to say, sir, that it may seem strange to you that I\r\nshould so suddenly ask your advice, but, you see--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, not at all,\" he genially interrupted. \"I am consulted on all\r\nkinds of matters; in fact, I pass for a real doctor--out on the trail.\r\nI carry a little medicine-case for emergencies, and I assume all the\r\nauthority of the regular practitioner--on occasion. I shall be very\r\nsorry if my distaste for the title 'professor' leads you to think me\r\nunsympathetic. I shall be very glad to assist you in any way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. You see, I was brought up to esteem learning, and we\r\nseldom meet one of your eminence--we are so completely out of the\r\nworld here--it is a great pleasure to us--\"\r\n\r\nFootsteps just outside of the screen-door announced the return of the\r\ngirl, who entered composedly, followed by a young man. Her manner was\r\ncold, her glance aloof, as she greeted Serviss.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad you came,\" she said. \"I was afraid you would forget us.\" She\r\nturned towards her escort, who had halted in the doorway. \"Professor\r\nServiss, this is the Reverend Mr. Clarke, the pastor of our church.\"\r\n\r\nAs Serviss shook hands with the Reverend Clarke he experienced a\r\ndistinct shock of repulsion--an unaccountable feeling, for the\r\nclergyman was decidedly handsome, at first sight. But his hand was\r\ncold, his face pallid, and a bitter line, the worn pathway of a sneer,\r\ncurved at one corner of his mouth. \"Unwholesome, anæmic,\" was\r\nServiss's inward comment as he turned away to address the girl, whose\r\nchange of manner exerted a new witchery over him.\r\n\r\nShe was dressed in black for some reason, and her face seemed both sad\r\nand morose, but the graceful dignity of her strong young body was\r\nenhanced by her dark gown. Her hands, her feet, were shapely, without\r\nbeing dainty. \"Plainly these women come of good stock, no matter what\r\nthe husband and father may be,\" Serviss thought. He resented the\r\nclergyman's intrusive presence more and more. \"Is he brought in as a\r\nsafeguard?\" he asked himself.\r\n\r\nMr. Clarke's attitude was certainly forbidding. He perched in grim,\r\nexpectant silence on the edge of his chair, waiting, watching. His\r\nlean face had the blue-white look of the much-shaven actor, and his\r\nmanner was as portentous as that of a tragedian.\r\n\r\n\"What the devil does he mean by staring at me like that?\" Serviss\r\ncontinued to ask himself. \"Does he expect me to go off like a bomb?\"\r\n\r\nHe had started a discussion of the weather or some other harmless\r\ntopic, when Clarke began, in a deep voice, with the formal inflections\r\nof the parson: \"Miss Lambert tells me you are from Corlear University,\r\nprofessor?\"\r\n\r\nServiss groaned and threw up his hands with a comical gesture. \"Well,\r\nlet it go at that. I suppose it explains me to call me 'professor.'\r\nYes, I have a connection there--I draw a salary from the\r\ninstitution.\"\r\n\r\nThe clergyman regarded him soberly, as did the women, without sharing\r\nhis humor in the least. Evidently being a professor in a university\r\nwas no light thing to a Western preacher. \"She tells me you have\r\nproposed to act as her adviser--\"\r\n\r\nAgain Serviss protested. \"Oh, nothing so formidable as that, my dear\r\nsir. I have promised to make inquiries for her.\" Then, obscurely moved\r\nto create a better impression in the girl's mind, he added: \"I shall\r\nbe very happy, of course, to do all that is in my power to aid you,\r\nMiss Lambert, but, as I have just been saying to your mother, I can\r\nonly act through my friends. Nobody enjoys music more than I, but no\r\none can possibly know less about it. In these days of specialization\r\none is forced to one's own little groove in order to achieve practical\r\nresults. General culture is impossible to specially trained sharps\r\nlike myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"What _is_ your specialty, may I ask?\" inquired Clarke, remotely.\r\n\r\n\"I usually answer 'bugs,' but when I wish to be quite understood I\r\nexplain that I am a physiological chemist and biologist. At the\r\npresent moment I am assistant in the pathological department of the\r\nCorlear Medical College.\"\r\n\r\nThe preacher seemed to lighten a little. \"Ah! that is a noble study, a\r\nstudy of incalculable service to mankind. I am deeply interested in\r\nthat line of thought myself--I may say _vitally_ interested, for I\r\nsuffer from lung trouble. One by one the germs of disease are being\r\ndiscovered and their antitoxins catalogued.\" It was evident that he\r\nwas anxious to impress the women with his wonderful understanding of\r\nthe scientist's work and aims.\r\n\r\nHis tone was so sententious that Serviss instantly became flippant, as\r\nan offset. \"Yes, one by one we round 'em up! But don't think me\r\nunfriendly to the 'beasts.' They have their uses. I'd no sooner kill a\r\nbacterium than a song-bird. I think we care too highly for the\r\ncancerous and the consumptive. I'm not at all sure that humanity\r\noughtn't to be hackled like weeds, and so toughen its hold on life.\r\nGerms may be blessings in disguise.\"\r\n\r\nClarke pursued his way. \"How little we know about their\r\nreactions--their secretions. You've given some attention to the X-ray\r\nand its effect on these cells, I presume?\"\r\n\r\nServiss inwardly grinned to think what Weissmann would say at sight of\r\nhis assistant sitting in solemn discussion of the germs and X-rays\r\nwith a village clergyman and two reverential women. \"Why, yes, I've\r\nconsidered it. Naturally, any new thing that bears on my specialty\r\nmakes me sit up. I've even done a little experimenting with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But have you considered the bearing of all these subtleties of\r\nscience upon\"--he hesitated--\"a--upon certain--a--occult phenomena?\"\r\n\r\nServiss eyed him non-committally. \"Well, what, for instance?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, upon, say, telepathy--and--a--well, upon spiritual healing--and\r\nthe like.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't say that I have; I don't exactly see the connection.\r\nFurthermore, I don't believe in these particular delusions. My work\r\nconcerns the material facts of life, not the dying superstitions of\r\nthe race. I have no patience with any morbid theory of life.\"\r\n\r\nThis remark plainly produced a sensation. The preacher cast a\r\nsignificant glance at the mother, and the girl looked away at the\r\nlamp, a flush upon her face.\r\n\r\n\"Hello!\" exclaimed Serviss, under his breath. \"Have I discovered a\r\nneat of cranks? I've been enlisted on somebody's side--I wonder\r\nwhose?\"\r\n\r\nThe clergyman faced him again and calmly asked: \"Have you ever\r\n_investigated_ these occult phenomena?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not. I have no time to waste on such imaginings. My time is\r\nall taken in a study of certain definite processes in the living\r\norganism.\"\r\n\r\nA light began to glow in the eyes of the young clergyman. \"I suppose\r\nyou class mental healing among the delusions?\"\r\n\r\n\"Most assuredly I do,\" answered Serviss, with the remorselessness of\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\n\"You would say that the mind of man cannot mend the body of another--\"\r\n\r\n\"If you mean directly--in the manner of 'faith cures' and the like--I\r\nwould answer certainly not, unless the disorder happens to be in\r\nitself due to a delusion. I can imagine the hypochondriac being cured\r\nby mental stimulus.\" He felt that he was drawing near the point at\r\nissue, and his eyes shone with glee.\r\n\r\nThe preacher set his trap. \"You believe in the action of a drug--say,\r\nprussic acid--you believe it will kill?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and quite irrespective of the opinion of the one who takes it.\r\nHis thinking it water will not check or change its action in the\r\nslightest degree.\"\r\n\r\n\"But _how_ does it kill?\" persisted Clarke. \"What does it _do_?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you mean why, at the last analysis, does one drug attack cells and\r\nthe other nourish them, I answer, frankly, I don't know--nobody\r\nknows.\"\r\n\r\nClarke pursued his point. \"Under the microscope, the germ of, say,\r\ntetanus is a minute bar with spore at the end like the head of a\r\ntadpole. Of what is this cell composed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably of a jelly-like substance with excessively minute filaments,\r\nbut we don't know. We are at the limit of the microscope. We trace\r\ncertain processes, we even dissect certain cells, but elemental\r\ncomposition of plasm remains a mystery.\"\r\n\r\nThe preacher glowed with triumph. \"Then you confess yourself baffled?\r\nThe union of matter and spirit is beyond your microscope. What do you\r\nknow about a drop of water? You say it is formed of hydrogen and\r\noxygen in such and such proportions. What _is_ hydrogen? Why do they\r\nunite?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" calmly replied Serviss. \"We admit that any material\r\nsubstance remains inexplicable. The molecule lies far below the line\r\nof visibility. We only push the zone of the known a little farther\r\ninto the realm of the unknown; but how does that serve your argument?\"\r\n\r\n\"By demonstrating that the mind of a man is simply the mastering\r\nmystery in a world of mysteries, and that there is no known limit to\r\nwhat it may do. We say that at the point where life enters to\r\ndifferentiate the germ is beyond science--there of necessity faith is\r\nborn.\"\r\n\r\n\"You say 'we'--are you an apostle of 'the new church'?\" asked Serviss,\r\nabruptly.\r\n\r\nThe preacher visibly shrank. \"I do not care to announce my growing\r\nconviction to my congregation, at present; but I find many things\r\nabout the doctrine which appeal to me. Some form of spiritism is the\r\ncoming religion--in my judgment. The old order changeth. The\r\ntraditional theology--the very faith I preach--has become too gross,\r\ntoo materialistic, for this age; some sweeter and more mystic faith is\r\nto follow. Even science is prophesying new power for man, new realms\r\nfor the spirit. You men of science pretend to lead, but you are\r\nlaggards. You pore upon the culture of germs, but shut your eyes to\r\nthe most vital of all truths. Is the life beyond the grave of less\r\naccount than the habits of animalculæ?\"\r\n\r\nThe young scientist listened to this query with outward courtesy, but\r\ninwardly his gorge rose. \"I see one gain in your new position,\" he\r\nanswered, lightly. \"Matter is no longer the dead, inorganic, 'godless\r\nthing' which the old-time theologians declared it to be. Matter, so\r\nfar from being some inert lump, is permeated with life--is life\r\nitself. So far as we now know, all the visible and tangible universe\r\nis resolvable into terms of force--that is to say, chemical process.\r\nThere may be no line of demarcation between the organic and the\r\ninorganic.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet with your knowledge of the inscrutable final mystery of\r\nmatter you set a mark at the grave! You condemn all manifestation of\r\nthe spirit, all the phenomena of spiritism, for example?\"\r\n\r\n\"Condemn is not the word--we simply say the phenomena are absurd, the\r\nspirit cannot exist without the body--\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever investigated a single form of spirit manifestation?\r\nHave you studied the claims of those who are in touch with the spirit\r\nworld?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\nThe preacher's sneer broke forth. \"I can't see but you scientists are\r\nquite as dogmatic, quite as bigoted as the theologians.\"\r\n\r\nServiss laughed. \"It does look a little that way. However, I'm not as\r\nuninformed as I seem. It happens that I am in close personal contact\r\nwith men whose specialty is the study of morbid psychology, and I know\r\nthe quality of those who act as mediums for the return of the dead.\"\r\nThe intensity of the interest on the part of the little group before\r\nhim was astonishing, not to say appalling. \"It is evident that the\r\nmother and her pastor are both of the new dispensation or worse,\" was\r\nhis thought, but his natural courtesy led him to say, placably: \"There\r\nare mysteries in the world, I admit--in chemistry as in biology--but\r\nthey seem to me to be different in very essence from the 'mysteries'\r\nof spiritualism and all allied 'psychic phenomena,' which appear to me\r\nessentially absurd, ignoble--'ratty,' to use a slang phrase--a faith\r\nfounded upon things done in the dark, always in the dark.\"\r\n\r\nThe preacher flamed out at this. \"I knew you would get round to that;\r\nthat is the reason why I began by drawing you out on the X-ray. How\r\nlittle do we know of motion! The X-ray moves in straight lines, I\r\nunderstand, while light has a wave motion. Hence they are\r\nantagonistic. May it not be that the spirits of those gone before\r\nmanifest by means of an unknown force which light neutralizes? May\r\nthis not be the explanation why the phenomena of the spirit world\r\nrequire darkness?\"\r\n\r\n\"It may,\" answered Serviss, dryly; \"but there is a far easier\r\nexplanation--But, see here,\" he returned to his boyish humor, \"this is\r\nmy vacation. I came out here to escape 'shop,' and here we are wasting\r\ntime on X-rays and spiritism, and boring our patient hostess besides.\r\nMiss Lambert, won't you play for us and clear the air of our\r\ncontroversial dust?\"\r\n\r\nThe girl, who had been sitting during this conversation in rigid\r\nimmobility, intent on every word, now turned towards Clarke as if\r\nasking his consent. The mother, too, seemed to wait anxiously for the\r\nminister's answer, as if wondering whether he would willingly cut\r\nshort his interrogation.\r\n\r\nHis eyes were still glowing with the heat of controversy, but he\r\ngravely said: \"I hope you will give me another opportunity to discuss\r\nthis matter. It is very important to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, with pleasure,\" answered Serviss, glad to rid himself of\r\nthe discussion of the moment.\r\n\r\nAs Viola stood slowly turning the leaves of her music, three loud\r\nknocks sounded upon the inner door, as if an insistent neighbor had\r\nentered and signalled for help. The mother rose and went out\r\nhurriedly, but the clergyman merely glanced after her, and said to the\r\ngirl:\r\n\r\n\"You would better play, Viola.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl dashed into a stormy Polish march, which she played very\r\nwell, but with a mechanical precision which seemed to offend Clarke,\r\nwho rose and laid his hand on her arm. \"Wait, you're not in the mood\r\nyet.\" He turned to Serviss. \"The spirit of our discussion is upon her.\r\nShe is very sensitive to such things. I will sing first--if you don't\r\nobject,\" he added, in a new tone, a touch of apology in his voice, and\r\nhe gave out the effect of addressing an unseen auditor--some one in\r\nthe inner room.\r\n\r\n\"I shall be delighted,\" replied Serviss, with formal politeness,\r\nthough he began to apprehend something morbidly forbidding in the\r\nminister and in his influence on the girl. An extraordinary intimacy\r\nwas revealed, not so much in the words he spoke as in the tones he\r\nused. \"Here is the girl's lover,\" he decided.\r\n\r\nThere was no timidity or hesitation in Viola's manner as she struck\r\nthe first chords of an old ballad, and Clarke, transformed by a new\r\nand lofty mood, sang, with notable beauty of phrasing, \"The Banks o'\r\nBen Lomond.\" Something in the melancholy of the lover's cry seemed to\r\nfit with this singular young preacher's mood. His voice searched the\r\nheart, his eyes misted with feeling, and when he finished Serviss\r\napplauded most fervently, \"Bravo!\" and impulsively offered his hand.\r\n\r\n\"My dear fellow, you have a wonderful voice. _You_ are the one to go\r\nto New York; you'd make Carolus look to his laurels. Sing something\r\nelse--something of Strauss. Do you know Strauss?\"\r\n\r\nClarke smiled with wistful sadness. \"I sing very few ballads. My voice\r\nwas given me to use in Christ's service, not for the gratification of\r\nmy pride.\"\r\n\r\nServiss recoiled before this sanctimonious speech, and the light went\r\nout of his face. A disgust which he could not entirely conceal crossed\r\nhis lips. \"My dear sir, you can't serve the Lord better than by\r\nsinging beautiful songs to the weary people of this earth. To wear out\r\na voice like that on pinchbeck hymn tunes is a crime.\" Then, as if\r\nbecoming conscious of a neglect of the girl, he added: \"Now that you\r\nare in the mood, Miss Lambert, you must try that sonata again.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl seemed not to be offended by his enthusiasm over the\r\nminister's singing, and with a word in a low voice to Clarke, who\r\nplaced a sheet of music before her, she began to play, opening the\r\ncomposition with unexpected breadth and dignity of phrasing. Serviss\r\nlistened with growing amazement. Her hands were not large, but they\r\nhad ample spread and were under perfect control. There was power in\r\nthe poise of her head and in the rhythmic swaying of her body, but her\r\nplaying was curiously unfeminine. There was no touch of girlish grace,\r\nof sentiment, in her performance, and with a sudden enlightenment\r\nServiss inwardly exclaimed: \"Aha! A clerical Svengali! This musical\r\npreacher has trained his pupil till she plays as _he_ would play if he\r\nhad the digital facility. It's all fine, but it is not the girl,\" and\r\nthe question of their relationship again engaged him.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: \"SERVISS LISTENED WITH GROWING AMAZEMENT\"]\r\n\r\nWhen the final stormy note was still, Viola remained on her stool, as\r\nthough waiting for her critic to applaud.\r\n\r\nServiss broke the silence by exclaiming: \"See here, you people are\r\nmaking game of me. You are both professionals in disguise. Come now,\r\n'fess up,\" he challenged Clarke. \"You are Señor Del Corte, barytone of\r\nthe Salt-Air Opera Company; and you, Miss Lambert, belong to the Arion\r\nLadies' Orchestra. I have found you both out!\"\r\n\r\nThe girl smiled with pleasure, but Clarke remained so unassailably\r\nserious that Serviss was moved to further deeps of audacity. \"Don't\r\ntell me you are a comedian, also! You certainly have me guessing. Who\r\nare you, really?\"\r\n\r\nClarke answered, resentfully: \"I am the pastor of the Presbyterian\r\nchurch in this village, as Miss Lambert has told you, and she is my\r\norganist.\"\r\n\r\nAgain that thump three times repeated sounded upon the door. Serviss,\r\nbaffled and silenced by Clarke's impenetrable gravity, and by\r\nsomething inexplicably submissive, yet watchful, in the face of the\r\ngirl, felt himself confronted by an intangible, sinister, and\r\ninescapable influence. The young clergyman seemed to darken and\r\noppress both women. It was as if they were all leagued in a conspiracy\r\nto deceive and cajole. This bewilderment lasted but a moment, and he\r\nrose from his chair with a spring. \"Well, now, play something\r\nelse--give us a bit of rag-time; that last piece has left us all a\r\nlittle dashed--try a cake-walk.\"\r\n\r\nClarke interposed. \"Miss Lambert does not play those trashy melodies.\r\nI consider them essentially irreligious.\"\r\n\r\nServiss resented the preacher's tone, but quickly answered: \"They're\r\nnot exactly reverent, I'll admit; but without them American music\r\nwould be but a poor reflection of the German.\"\r\n\r\nAs if to save his reputation the preacher sang \"The Palms,\" and sang\r\nit magnificently; and the girl accompanied him with such accuracy and\r\ngood judgment that Serviss was able to infer long hours of practice,\r\nand this did not please him.\r\n\r\n\"His influence on her and on this household is not good,\" he decided.\r\n\"That chap is decidedly morbid. If he is married, so much the worse.\r\nHe's far too handsome to be a safe guide to an impressionable young\r\ngirl. There is some mystery here,\" and he recalled that Viola's face\r\nwas troubled when first he saw it. And at the close of this song,\r\nwithout a glance at the preacher, he offered a parting hand to Viola.\r\n\"If I can be of any aid in putting you in touch with a teacher in New\r\nYork, please write me. I think you have my card. You play with\r\nastonishing power and brilliancy. You would certainly interest a man\r\nlike Greer.\"\r\n\r\nHer face flamed with color--all her sullen restraint vanished, all her\r\ngirlish charm came back. \"Oh, do you think so? Do you suppose I could\r\nget him to teach me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't say that--he is a very busy man--but I think you are\r\ndecidedly to be encouraged. But I may be able to hear you again before\r\nI go. I want to hear you play alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you would come again.\" There was a subtle entreaty in her\r\nvoice, almost a prayer; and in her uplifted face was expressed the\r\nrespect and confidence of a child. His heart was moved with pity as\r\nwell as with admiration, and, turning to the mother, he added: \"I\r\nshall probably remain over Sunday, and it would be a pleasure if I\r\nmight come again to your pretty home.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lambert's face glowed with pleasure. \"It will be a great honor to\r\nhave you, sir.\"\r\n\r\nIn this spirit he went away, without again taking Clarke's hand, with\r\na last glance at the girl's face as she stood at the open door to let\r\nhim pass. He turned from the gate with a sense of having been\r\npermitted a glance into the very heart of a secret drama which might\r\nat any moment become a tragedy. His interest was profoundly stirred,\r\nhis sympathies wholly enlisted in behalf of this girl, so young and so\r\naspiring.\r\n\r\nAs he stood above the roaring water he formulated a theory with regard\r\nto the relationship of the personalities he had just left behind him.\r\n\"The girl is being persecuted by this man Clarke, who is madly in love\r\nwith her. She has an inner repugnance to him; but he is a clergyman,\r\nand that means a great deal to a girl in the adoration stage. Her\r\nmother, a nice, religious sort of person, favors the preacher, of\r\ncourse; but the father probably despises him. Clarke is evidently\r\nlosing his hold on the rock-ballasted keel of his creed, and in his\r\nshipwreck he may carry that girl down with him; such cases are all too\r\ncommon. If he is married, he is all the more dangerous. But it is not\r\nmy duty to interfere.\" He ended, resolute to put the whole problem\r\nfrom him: \"The girl has legal guardians--on them rests the blame if\r\nshe is corrupted. To reform this world has never been my call.\"\r\n\r\nBut he could not rid himself of a growing sense of responsibility. His\r\nmind returned again and again to the complication into which he had\r\nsuddenly been thrust. \"Perhaps this desire on the part of the girl to\r\ngo away to study is only an instinctive desire to escape. It would be\r\nlike that preacher to have a worn, little, commonplace wife. What can\r\nLambert be thinking of to let such a man come into his home and direct\r\nthe daily life of both his wife and daughter? He is neglecting his\r\nplain duty.\"\r\n\r\nHe fell asleep, fancying himself on the way up the trail to the mine,\r\nand when he woke to find the good, rectifying rays of the morning sun\r\nfilling his room the theories of the night were absurd. He desired to\r\nsee the girl again, not to warn her of her peril, but because she was\r\npiquant and lovely, as befitted her romantic surroundings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nIN THE MARSHALL BASIN\r\n\r\n\r\nIt must have been about eleven o'clock next morning when Serviss rode\r\nup and dismounted at the Lambert gate, and in the flaming light of\r\nmid-day the sense of mystification, the feeling that the girl was in\r\nthe coils of some invisible menace, had entirely vanished. The\r\npreacher had sunk to the rôle of a conceited clerical ass who regarded\r\nscience as an enemy to his especial theories and the visible universe\r\nas an outlying province of Calvinism; while Viola, who came to the\r\ndoor, was again most humanly charming, delighting his eyes like the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nShe smiled blithely and spoke collectedly, in response to his\r\ngreeting; but when he asked her to be his guide to the wonders of the\r\nregion her face clouded in dismay.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry; I wish I could; but I must carry a message up to my\r\nfather at the mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, why not take me? I infer you go on horseback?\"\r\n\r\nShe hesitated. \"Yes, but it's a long, hard ride--and you said you were\r\ntired of the saddle.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was yesterday; but I feel quite rested now. By all means let me\r\naccompany you. I should particularly enjoy mounting high to-day. I\r\nshould also like to meet your father.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, I will speak to mother,\" she replied, with shining face,\r\nand disappeared within.\r\n\r\nThe mother, mindful of Serviss's connection with a great university,\r\nmade no objection to the plan. On the contrary, she was pleased and\r\nflattered by his interest in her daughter, and a few moments later the\r\nyoung people rode off up the mountain road side by side and in high\r\nspirits.\r\n\r\nServiss winced at times at the childish flatness of Viola's comment,\r\nbut her voice was musical and her face flower-like--therefore he\r\nforgave her. With all his knowledge of the constitution of matter, he\r\nwas still young and in the mating mood.\r\n\r\nThey talked of the flowers, of the trails, of the birds to be found on\r\nthe heights for a time; but soon, inevitably, they came to talk of\r\nthemselves. Under his questioning she outlined her plans for a musical\r\neducation, and this led at last to a consideration of the Reverend Mr.\r\nClarke.\r\n\r\nAt the first mention of his name the girl's face distinctly darkened\r\nand her answers became curiously studied, almost evasive--or so it\r\nseemed to Serviss.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I play in his church,\" she said, \"and he teaches me. He is a\r\nsplendid musician--don't you think so? I owe a great deal to him. He\r\nhas helped me so much--especially in my phrasing. He is a wonderful\r\nman. We are fortunate in having him with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"He struck me as a little morbid, not to say morose. Has he had\r\ntrouble in his church?\"\r\n\r\nHer answer was deep-toned and affectedly solemn in one so young. \"No,\r\nbut his wife passed out last year.\"\r\n\r\n\"Passed out? What do you mean by that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean she died.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I see!\" His inflection checked her confidence, and they rode for\r\na little way in silence.\r\n\r\nServiss was thinking. The situation is now clear. Clarke is working\r\nupon this sweet and charming girl in order to have her take the place\r\nof his dead wife. A sorrowful thing to think of, but not so bad as I\r\nhave been imagining. At length he asked: \"What else can you tell me\r\nabout this Mr. Clarke? Is he a native of the West?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, he is from the East. He had a big church in Brooklyn; but his\r\nhealth gave out and he was forced to leave it. He came here for the\r\nbaths and the air. He is much better now.\"\r\n\r\n\"He retains all his intellectual diseases, however. What medicine will\r\nhe find for those?\" Meeting the girl's startled glance, he hastened to\r\nadd: \"I beg your pardon, I was just wondering if he were as morbid\r\nwhen he came as he now seems.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no! He was quite cheerful till his wife went away. That changed\r\nhim greatly. For months he hardly left his study. He reads too much\r\neven now. That is why he looks so pale. His house is packed with\r\nbooks.\"\r\n\r\n\"He seems in need of fresh air. How does your father get on with him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all well.\"\r\n\r\n\"I inferred that. Your father is a man of deeds--of open air--I take\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Lambert isn't my own father,\" she took this opportunity to\r\nexplain. \"My own father passed to the other side when I was eleven.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon my curiosity, Miss Lambert, but you've used a phrase once or\r\ntwice which I've heard the people of a certain faith use. Is your\r\nmother a spiritualist?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with timid eyes, then turned quickly away. \"She--she\r\nused to be; she's studying theosophy now.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the minister is trying to convert you all to his especial theory!\r\nI can imagine his discourses. No wonder you want to flee.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl's whole face, voice, and manner changed--became bitter,\r\npassionate. \"Oh, I hate it! I hate it! I want to be free of it all!\"\r\n\r\nThe intensity of her utterance amazed Serviss, and he studied her\r\nprofile in silence before he answered. \"I think I know what you mean,\r\nand I sympathize with you. You're too young to be troubled by the\r\ndoubts and dismays of men like Clarke. He is preposterous in the face\r\nof a landscape like this. Let us forget him and his 'isms.'\" With\r\nthese words he straightened in his saddle and lifted his eyes towards\r\nthe height before them. \"Isn't that superb!\"\r\n\r\nThey were drawing near the great gray boundary-wall of the valley,\r\nand the sound of roaring water grew tumultuous as they rounded the\r\ncurve in the road and came into the little triangular nook which had\r\nbeen anciently formed by the Colorow as it descended in power from its\r\nsource in the high parks. On the left the ledges rose almost sheer for\r\na thousand feet, and from the edge of this cliff ore-buckets, a-slide\r\non invisible cables, appeared in the sky, swooping like eagles,\r\nsilently dropping one by one, to disappear, tamely as doves, in the\r\ngable end of a huge, drab-colored mill which stood upon the flat\r\nbeside the stream. Beyond the mill Mount Ignacio rose darkly purple,\r\nhooded in white clouds.\r\n\r\nThe entire scene was typical of the West, of its energy, its greed,\r\nand its faith. Here was life--life and buoyant health--and the blood\r\nof the young scientist quickened as he comprehended the daring, the\r\noriginality of the miner's plan.\r\n\r\n\"Is this your father's enterprise?\" he asked, in the hope of an\r\naffirmative answer. A man of this quality would hang the minister if\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\"Oh no. We've got to climb the hill and cross the upper Basin before\r\nwe reach our mine. This is the ore from the San Luis tunnel.\"\r\n\r\nShe was, happily, of the sunny world now, and, with a gay smile,\r\nturned her horse into a narrow trail and called back to him: \"We climb\r\nhere.\" He followed, admiring the strength and grace of her rounded\r\nfigure as her horse zigzagged up the steep acclivity. She was troubled\r\nby no problems at this moment. She was rather a daughter of the\r\nmountains, a sister to the eagles.\r\n\r\nShe stopped once or twice to permit him to locate the far-famed peaks\r\nrising one by one to the south of them, and the third time she drew\r\nrein he was a-foot, and she said, \"We're almost to the top of this\r\ngrade; it's easier in the Basin.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am thinking only of my horse,\" he answered. \"You see, he is\r\ncarrying a forty-pound saddle, and is not so fresh as yours. I'm sorry\r\nto delay you.\"\r\n\r\nThe Basin was a most glorious valley, bowl-shaped, green with grass\r\nand groves of aspen and fir, and flooded with a cataract of sunshine.\r\nAll about it ran a rim of lofty summits, purple in shadow, garnet and\r\ngold and green in the sun. Here and there a prospect-hole showed like\r\na scar, or a gray, dismantled stamp-mill stood like a disintegrating\r\nbowlder beside its yellow-gray dump of useless ore. Serviss, familiar\r\nwith the rise and fall of the silver-miner, looked over the lovely\r\nvalley with a certain sense of satisfaction, for he was able to\r\nreconstruct its beauty before that flood of devastating humankind\r\nswept up from the eastern plain. \"Nature is reasserting her dominion,\"\r\nhe said, aloud. \"Mining is a wounding business--like murder.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl glanced away to the south. \"We'll have to hurry if we reach\r\ncamp by one o'clock,\" she called, and he waved his hand as a sign of\r\nsurrender to her leadership.\r\n\r\nThey overtook a long train of burros bearing a most miscellaneous\r\ncargo of odds and ends of machinery, nail-kegs, iron-rods, bundles of\r\nbolts, lumber, oil, and boxes of groceries.\r\n\r\n\"This is all father's--all for the new mill,\" said the girl, nodding\r\nand smiling at the Mexicans in charge of the donkeys. \"Hello, Clint!\"\r\nshe called, cheerily, to another muleteer, a little farther up the\r\ntrail, a brown, good-looking young fellow, who saluted her joyfully,\r\nhis eyes aglow with adoration.\r\n\r\n\"Every man is her suitor,\" thought Serviss, with a twinge of\r\ndisapproval. \"Think what she must seem to that leather-colored Arab\r\nurging forward those donkeys!\" And a knowledge of her danger--he put\r\nit that way--began to oppress him. \"She is too fine and sweet to marry\r\namong these rough miners.\"\r\n\r\nShe, it seemed, was not afraid of mountaineers, for she had a gay nod\r\nand a bright word for every one she met, though some of them were\r\nbrutal-mouthed and grimy and sullen. Serviss derived no comfort from\r\nthe fact that the most sinister of them brightened for an instant in\r\nthe light of her adorable smile.\r\n\r\nAt last, far ahead, they came in sight of the mill on a bare peak. The\r\nwhite clouds which had been silently gathering round the great domes\r\nswiftly overspread the whole sky. The air grew chill as November. The\r\nwind began to roar in the firs with a stern mournfulness which went to\r\nthe heart of the man; but the girl, without once stopping her horse,\r\nunrolled her raincoat and put it on, calling back at her cavalier as\r\nshe did so with a fine, challenging, gleeful shout.\r\n\r\nThey were very high now. Perennial ice lay in the gullies and on the\r\nnorth side of the cliffs, and the air was light and keen. Suddenly the\r\nwind died away. A gray hush came over the valley. The water in the\r\nstreams lost its vivid green and became lead-color streaked with white\r\nfoam. One by one the mountains were blotted out by the storm. The\r\nworld of sky and rocks grew mysterious, menacing; but the girl pushed\r\nfearlessly forward, singing like a robin, while the rain slashed over\r\nher, and the thunder boomed and re-echoed from crag to crag like\r\nwarning guns in magnificent alarums. \"I love this!\" she cried, her\r\nclear voice piercing the veil of water like a flute note. \"Don't you?\"\r\n\r\nServiss was not without imagination, and the contrast of this jocund,\r\nfearless, free young maid with the silent, constrained girl of the\r\nnight before moved him to wonder. \"Here she is herself--nature's own\r\nchild,\" he thought. \"Last night she was a 'subject'--a plaything of\r\nthe preacher's. Strange the mother does not realize her daughter's\r\ndanger.\"\r\n\r\nThe storm passed as quickly as it came, and when they drew rein at the\r\nmine the sun was shining. The mill, standing on a smooth, steep slope,\r\nand sheltered on the north by a group of low firs, seemed half a ruin,\r\nbut was, in fact, being rebuilt and enlarged. All about it were dumps\r\nof clay, slippery with water, and rough bunk-houses and ore-sheds. All\r\nthe structures were rude, masculine, utilitarian, and the girl grew\r\neach moment in delicacy and refinement by contrast.\r\n\r\nIn answer to her halloo a plainly clad man came to the door, his face\r\nset in amazement.\r\n\r\n\"Why--see here--daughter! I wasn't looking for you to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm here just the same,\" she laughingly replied. \"Here are some\r\ntelegrams. Professor Serviss, this is my father.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph Lambert was a small man, with shy, blue eyes and a low and\r\ngentle utterance. He carried his head leaning a little to the left and\r\nseemed a shade discouraged, almost melancholy. He was, however, a\r\nbrave, silent, tireless little man, who had made one great fortune in\r\nsilver-mines only to lose it in the panic. He was now cannily working\r\na vein which had a streak of gold in it, and, like all miners, was\r\njust on the point of making a \"strike.\" He was distracted with work,\r\nand, though cordial, could not at the moment give much time to his\r\nvisitor.\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, Viola, you take Professor Serviss into the cook-house and\r\nfeed him. I guess you'll find something left over. If not, you will\r\nhave to scratch up something.\"\r\n\r\nViola thereupon led the way into the kitchen, greeting each man she\r\nmet, cooks and waiters alike, with impartial, clear-eyed joyousness\r\nand trust, and when the food came on she ate without grimace or\r\nhesitation. The cook, a big, self-contained Chinaman, came in with a\r\nchina cup.\r\n\r\n\"Use this klup--tin klup no good for lady.\" His voice was gruff and\r\nhis manner that of one who compels a child to use a napkin; but it\r\nwas plain he adored her. As she thanked him he shuffled away with an\r\nirrepressible grin.\r\n\r\nAll this produced in Serviss an uneasiness. To him she was a lamb\r\nventuring among wolves. \"She should not expose herself to the coarse\r\ncomment, the seeking eyes of these fellows,\" he indignantly commented,\r\nblaming the acquiescent mother and the absent-minded step-father.\r\n\"This childlike trust is charming, but it is not war.\"\r\n\r\nHer essential weakness of defence, her innocence, began to move him\r\ndeeply, dangerously. He began to understand how she had turned to\r\nClarke for companionship, not merely because he was a clergyman, but\r\nbecause he was a young man of more than usual culture and attainment,\r\nwhose sympathy and counsel promised aid and comfort in her loneliness.\r\n\"She does not love him; she merely admires certain sides of his\r\ncharacter; she fears to marry him, and quite properly. His morbid\r\nfaith would destroy her.\"\r\n\r\nAs they were returning to the office they met the young driver of the\r\nmule-train, and Viola introduced him as \"Mr. Ward, of Boston.\"\r\n\r\nHe was tall and spare, with a fine, sensitive, boyish face--a face of\r\nrefinement which his rough, gray shirt, faded leggings, and badly\r\nbattered hat belied.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Ward is out here for his health, also,\" Viola explained. \"All the\r\nreally nice people are 'one-lungers.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it sad?\" said Ward, gravely. \"However, Miss Lambert is only\r\npartly right. I made my health an excuse. I'm here because I like it.\"\r\n\r\nServiss bent a keen look upon him. \"You don't look as if you had ever\r\nbeen sick.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not. I came out here to escape college--and my father's\r\nbusiness.\" He laughed. \"But don't betray me. I'm supposed to be\r\n'slowly improving.'\"\r\n\r\nThere was something fine and hawklike in the young fellow's profile as\r\nhe stood negligently leaning on the door-frame, his eyes on the\r\nflushed face of the girl; and Serviss experienced another pang of\r\njealous pain--they were so young, so comely, so full of the fire and\r\nimagination of youth. At the moment his own fame and special tasks\r\nwere of small account.\r\n\r\nUpon their return to the office Lambert met them in the same\r\nabsent-minded, apologetic way. \"I'm just getting some new machinery\r\ninto place and haven't a minute, but you must make yourself as much at\r\nhome as you can. Viola will show you around.\"\r\n\r\nServiss protested that he needed no entertainment, that he was not\r\ntired, and that he was well content to sit in the door and smoke and\r\nwatch the changing glory of the peaks, and this he did while Viola\r\nmoved about among the workmen in earnest conversation with her\r\nstep-father.\r\n\r\n\"She is explaining me,\" Serviss reasoned. \"I wish I could hear what\r\nshe says. It would be amusing to know myself as she sees me. I hope\r\nshe doesn't think me middle-aged as well as wise.\"\r\n\r\nLambert listened to his daughter's words with attention, for a\r\nprofessor in a college was an exalted person in his eyes, and one of\r\nhis chief regrets at the moment was that he was unable to say to\r\nServiss, \"I am a college man myself\"; but this he could not do for the\r\nreason that the death of his father had taken him out of his class at\r\nthe beginning of his third year, and put him at the head of a large\r\nfamily as its breadwinner.\r\n\r\n\"He looks like a very young man, almost a boy--too young to be a\r\nprofessor; but then\"--here his eyes twinkled--\"when I was at Jefferson\r\nall professors seemed old to me. What's he doing here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just riding through the mountains on his vacation.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does your mother think of him?\"\r\n\r\n\"She likes him very much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I won't make any objection, then.\"\r\n\r\nViola stared--then blushed furiously. \"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, didn't you bring him up here to see how I liked him?\"\r\n\r\nShe pounded him with her little brown fist while tears of\r\nmortification filled her eyes. \"Now, you stop that! You're teasing me.\r\nWhy, I've only known him three days.\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed silently, shaking his head. \"Well, these things move\r\nquickly sometimes--and how was I to know but you'd known him in the\r\nEast--you seemed so chummy-like--\"\r\n\r\n\"You've spoiled everything,\" she wailed, deeply disturbed and\r\npainfully self-conscious. \"You're mean to me.\"\r\n\r\nHe became instantly contrite. \"There, now, don't you mind my joking.\r\nOf course I was fooling. It's all safe between us, anyway.\"\r\n\r\nBut the mischief was done. She forgave him, but never again would she\r\nbe the same to him, to her mother, or to the imperturbable young man\r\nsmoking his pipe beneath the firs. He _was_ young--that was only too\r\nplain to her now; not so young as Clinton, but not the middle-aged\r\nperson she had been fancying him to be.\r\n\r\nAs they were about to start on their homeward trail, Serviss sought\r\nopportunity to say: \"Mr. Lambert, I met this man Clarke at your house\r\nlast night, and I want to say that I don't think his influence on your\r\nfamily is particularly wholesome. He's morbid and given to fads.\"\r\n\r\nLambert replied: \"I know what you mean, professor, and I believe\r\nyou're right. I don't believe in him myself, and I don't take any\r\nstock in any of his notions, but my wife does. She thinks he's of the\r\nCovenant, somehow. I wish you'd talk with her and try to have her let\r\nup on Viola. I don't think they're doin' right by her. If she was my\r\nown girl I'd stop it--I would so.\" Then he added, in a curious tone,\r\nthis vague defence: \"As for Viola, she would be all right if they\r\nwould leave her alone. She's gifted in a way I don't understand; but\r\nif she isn't twisted by Clarke's foolishness she's going to make some\r\nman a good wife. She's a good girl, and, as I say, if she was my own\r\nchild I'd serve notice that this circle business should stop. I wish\r\nyou'd talk to 'em. I don't count--but they'll listen to you. I'm glad\r\nto have met you. I hope you'll come up again. I'd like to mill that\r\nbusiness over with you; it's all very curious, but I'm just plumb\r\ndistracted with work now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg you not to apologize--it's time to start back, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\nAs they rode away down the valley, the girl silent and constrained,\r\nServiss pondered Lambert's words, which were plainly directed against\r\nClarke. His sense of responsibility was increased by Lambert's trust\r\nin him. \"This won't do,\" he decided; \"I must pull out or I will find\r\nmyself laden with the woes of the entire family, and Clarke's\r\ndistresses besides.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl was invested now with compelling pathos. Each mile they\r\ndescended seemed to deepen the returning shadow on her face. The\r\ngayety, the buoyancy of the upward trail was gone. She was silent,\r\nconstrained, and sad; and he set to work to restore her to the simple\r\nand girlish candor of the morning. He called attention to the wonders\r\nof the western sky. He shouted to induce echoes, and challenged her to\r\na race, and at the last descent dared her to ride down in one of the\r\nore-buckets, seeking to bring the smiles back to her lips.\r\n\r\nShe responded to his cheer, but not as before. Something clouded her\r\nclear glance--her smiles died quickly, and the poise of her head was\r\nless alert.\r\n\r\nWhen they had reached the wagon-road and he could ride by her side,\r\nhe, too, became serious. \"I hope I haven't given offence in any way,\r\nMiss Lambert? If I have, I assure you it was entirely unintentional,\r\nand I beg your pardon.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked away. \"You have done nothing,\" she said, slowly.\r\n\r\n\"But you seem distinctly less friendly to me. I hope you didn't take\r\nanything I said concerning your mother's faith to heart. I had no\r\nintention of attacking her beliefs, but I must be honest with you--I\r\ndon't like Mr. Clarke. There's something unwholesome about him, and\r\nwhat you've told me to-day is not reassuring. Evidently he took the\r\ndeath of his wife very hard, and it has added to his natural tendency\r\ntowards a sort of spiritual monomania. As a matter of fact, he's more\r\nSpiritualist than Calvinist at present. Isn't that so?\"\r\n\r\nThe girl's face grew sullen and weary. \"Oh, I don't know, I'm tired of\r\nit all.\"\r\n\r\n\"He endlessly talks his grind, I suppose. How foolish, how sickly it\r\nall seems--here in the presence of uncontaminated nature! In such\r\nsunlight as this it seems insanity to sit in a book-walled room and\r\ngrow bloodless with dreaming over insoluble problems. And yet a friend\r\nof mine told me that these towns, and especially California towns,\r\nwere filled with seers and prophets. The occult flourishes in the\r\nhigh, dry atmosphere, those of the faith say. Don't you permit Clarke\r\nto destroy your love of nature, Miss Lambert; you belong to the sane\r\nand sunny world, and he has no right to bring his gloomy conceptions\r\nhome to you. You are too young and too naturally joyous to be\r\nconcerned with the problems of disease and death. You were made to be\r\nhappy.\"\r\n\r\nHe ended with greater earnestness than he had intended to use, and the\r\neffect of his words on the girl was very great. She could not speak;\r\ntears were in her eyes, and her bosom heaved most piteously. His sense\r\nof her helplessness deepened, and he added, \"Will you permit me to\r\ntalk to Mr. Clarke about you and your plans?\"\r\n\r\nThis seemed to alarm her. \"No, no!\" she cried out, distressfully.\r\n\"Please don't say anything to him about me. It will do no good. You\r\ndon't understand, and I can't tell you,\" she added, breathlessly.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" he said, soothingly; \"but, remember, your case interests\r\nme exceedingly, and you may call on me at any time and I will gladly\r\nhelp.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned a pale and tearful face towards him and extended her hand.\r\n\r\n\"I thank you very, very much. You _have_ helped me more than I can\r\nsay.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of the ride he discussed the springs, the source\r\nof the streams, the caverns, and other natural features of the scene,\r\nand had the satisfaction of seeing her face in a smile before he left\r\nher.\r\n\r\nHe went back to his hotel with a feeling of having spent six days in\r\nher company rather than six hours. She absorbed his entire thought,\r\nand so keen was his sense of her beleaguerment that he resolved to\r\ncall upon Clarke in order to define his character and to understand\r\nhis motives. \"His passions or his doubt overshadow the girl's sky, and\r\nI'm going to find out whether his designs are those of friend or\r\nfiend.\" At the moment he had a feeling that they were those of a\r\ndevouring fiend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nTHE FORCES OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS\r\n\r\n\r\nClarke's church typified the decaying faith of its pastor. Grass was\r\nserenely pushing up through the rotting planks of the walk which led\r\nfrom the street to the basement \"study\" just as the natural goodness\r\nand cheer of man returns to dominion through the barriers of custom.\r\nThe paint was blistering and peeling from the clap-boarding on the\r\nsunny side of the main building, and in one of the windows a piece of\r\nshingle had been set to repair a broken pane. It had the appearance of\r\nneglected age.\r\n\r\n\"The preacher was right--the creed of his church, as of all others, in\r\na lesser degree perhaps, is too crass, too mechanical, too childish to\r\ntally the ideals of a generation which is each day awakening to some\r\nnew potency of matter, some wider conception of the universe.\"\r\n\r\nOn the study door, checked by the sun and worn by the rain, the\r\ntourist applied his knuckle, and a voice, formal and sonorous, called\r\nout, \"Come in!\"\r\n\r\nOpening the door, which led directly into a dark little den with only\r\none window, Serviss confronted Clarke reading by a green-shaded lamp,\r\nin whose light he appeared as pallid, as remote from the sun, as a\r\nmonk of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nHe rose quickly upon recognizing his visitor. \"I'm glad to see you,\r\nprofessor; I beg your pardon for not rising. I thought the knock came\r\nfrom my janitor. Take a seat, please.\" He gathered a handful of books\r\nfrom a yellow arm-chair and pushed it forward with his foot. \"Your\r\nvisit is most opportune. I was meditating a call at your hotel\r\nto-night. I wanted to get your idea concerning two or three scientific\r\ndiscoveries which seem to me to have a most important bearing on the\r\nwelfare of the race.\"\r\n\r\nServiss became each moment more keenly aware of being face to face\r\nwith a task which required all his tact, his self-possession, and his\r\nwit, for the man before him was immured in self-conceit, accustomed to\r\ncarrying his point by a rush of words, and was, withal, a student\r\npossessed of unusual intellectual resource. He made a very handsome\r\nfigure as he took his seat amid his books. His face, freshly shaven,\r\ngleamed like blue-white marble, and his abundant dark hair, drawn away\r\nfrom his brow by careless fingers, lay in a tumbled mass above his\r\near, adding a noticeably sculptural finish to his shapely head. His\r\nhands, thin, long, and restless, alone betrayed the excitement which\r\nthe coming of this Master of the Germ engendered in him. He was eager\r\nto question, but he waited for his visitor to begin, which he did with\r\nmanly directness.\r\n\r\n\"I have called to talk with you about Miss Lambert. She and her mother\r\nhaving honored me by asking my advice as to her study in New York, I\r\nwould like to know whether you, as their pastor, counsel this movement\r\non her part?\"\r\n\r\nThe clergyman's sentient fingers sought, found, and closed tightly\r\nupon a ruler. \"That I cannot answer directly,\" he said, slowly. \"Miss\r\nLambert's case is not simple. She is a very remarkable musician, that\r\nyou know, and yet her talent is fitful. She sometimes plays very\r\nbadly. I am not at all sure she has the temperament which will succeed\r\non the music-stage.\"\r\n\r\n\"I made a somewhat similar remark to the mother myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Moreover, her interests are not the only factors in the problem. Mrs.\r\nLambert's life is bound up in her daughter, and without her she would\r\nsuffer. The well-being of the family as a whole is against her going.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have your own interests, too, I dare say.\"\r\n\r\nClarke's eyes narrowed. \"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be difficult to replace her here in your church-work, would\r\nit not?\"\r\n\r\nThe clergyman returned to his candid manner. \"It would, indeed. She is\r\nthe only organist in the village, and is invaluable to me, especially\r\nin the Sunday-school.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am disposed to consider her interests, and not those of the mother\r\nand father, or even the church,\" pursued Serviss. \"I am of those who\r\nrecognize the rights of the young as of chief importance to the race.\"\r\n\r\nClarke seized upon this as a gage of battle. \"The race! Oh, you\r\ninexorable men of science! What do we care for the race? We would save\r\nindividuals. The race can take care of itself. The race is only an\r\nabstraction--it cannot suffer. Of what avail to the individual to know\r\nthat the race is to be perfected a thousand years hence?\"\r\n\r\n\"We wander,\" interposed Serviss, with decision. \"The question is\r\nreally quite simple. Shall we advise the Lamberts to send their\r\ndaughter to New York to study music, or shall we counsel her to remain\r\nhere, and in marriage to some good, honest young miner resign herself\r\nto the common lot of women. Her talent should determine.\"\r\n\r\nA dull flush rose to the cheek of the preacher, his eyes fell and his\r\nvoice unconsciously softened. \"Marriage is still a long way off for\r\nViola Lambert; she is but a child, and, besides--\" He paused.\r\n\r\nServiss smiled. \"They marry young in the West, I believe. Besides, she\r\nmust be twenty, and quite robust.\"\r\n\r\n\"She seems but a child to me,\" repeated Clarke, returning to his\r\nclerical manner, and something in the hypocritical tone of his speech\r\nangered and disgusted Serviss, and to himself he said: \"He is a fraud.\r\nHe does not intend to let the girl pass out of his control.\" Then\r\naloud he reopened the discussion: \"It all comes back to a question of\r\nthe girl's talent. If it is sufficient to enable her to earn a living\r\nin some larger community, she has a right to go; if not, she should\r\ncertainly stay here. I believe in the largest possible life for every\r\nhuman being, and Miss Lambert's ambition is a perfectly legitimate\r\ncraving. Furthermore, she seems eager to escape from this life. She\r\nhints at some sort of mysterious persecution. She has not defined her\r\ntroubles in detail, but I inferred that some undesirable suitor made\r\nlife miserable for her.\" With these words he bent a keen glance at\r\nClarke.\r\n\r\n\"You are quite mistaken, sir. Miss Lambert has many admirers but no\r\nsuitors. I have cautioned her against entanglements of that kind. I\r\nhave shown how they would interfere with her work.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean her work in your church?\"\r\n\r\nClarke's eyes again took on the narrowed glance of suspicion. \"Partly\r\nthat, but more on account of other and higher work which I hope to see\r\nher do.\"\r\n\r\n\"To what do you refer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, of that I cannot at present speak; I can only say that it\r\nis a work whose preliminary stages can be passed as well here as in\r\nNew York City--better, in fact.\"\r\n\r\n\"You arouse my curiosity--\"\r\n\r\nClarke suddenly awoke from his musing and became aggressive. He\r\nresolutely changed the subject. \"Before you go I want to ask you--do\r\nyou, as a chemist, deny the immortality of the soul?\"\r\n\r\n\"Chemistry does not concern itself with the soul.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you, as a _man_, deny the immortality of the soul?\"\r\n\r\n\"I neither deny nor affirm. I have never concerned myself with the\r\nquestion.\"\r\n\r\nClarke was a little daunted. \"You leave the most vital question in all\r\nthis world uninvestigated!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, because I was long ago convinced that the problem of death, like\r\nthe origin of life, is insoluble, and why waste time on the insoluble?\r\nTo pore upon the constitution of matter is a species of mediævalism. I\r\nam concerned with what bacteria do--not what they are.\"\r\n\r\n\"I deny that the question of immortality _is_ insoluble!\" replied\r\nClarke, his eyes glowing with the fire of his faith. \"It is because\r\nyou scientists ignore the phenomena of spiritism that you remain\r\nignorant of the messages which come from the other side.\"\r\n\r\n\"What other side?\"\r\n\r\n\"The realm of those you call 'the dead.'\" He caught up a book. \"There\r\nis the word of a German scientist, a hundred times more eminent than\r\nyou, and here are the conclusions of two great Englishmen, members of\r\nthe Royal Academy, who have investigated and have been convinced of\r\nthe return of the dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know those men,\" replied Serviss, coldly. \"The common opinion is\r\nthat they ceased to be scientists when they wrote these volumes. All\r\nwere past their prime and bereaved, and one was nearly blind. Their\r\ntrue balance of judgment was lost before they set to work on what you\r\ncall their investigations. The German was considered insane on the\r\n'Fourth Dimension.' But what has this girl to do with your 'realm of\r\nthe dead' or my study of cancerous tissue? She belongs to the realm\r\nof music and flowers. I beg you to remember that. You have no right to\r\nthrow over her the shadow of your religious perplexities any more than\r\nI would have the right to lay before her my knowledge of parasitic\r\ngrowths. Youth, and especially young womanhood, has its rights, and\r\none of them is to be blithe. You admit that you are losing faith; why\r\ndestroy hers? Your doubts and despairs should not touch her. But they\r\nhave. She is troubled and sad by reason of your attitude towards life,\r\nand especially by your insistence upon the presence of death in the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\nThis was not precisely what Serviss had started out to say, but as he\r\nwent on a sense of being misled, a suspicion that he was playing into\r\nthe hands of the enemy, kept him from putting into words the strong\r\nconviction which had seized him.\r\n\r\nThe preacher put his interlocked fingers behind his head, and, looking\r\nat his visitor beneath lowered, contemptuous lids, replied: \"My dear\r\nsir, you don't know a thing of what you're talking about.\"\r\n\r\nThe note of patronization, the tone of superior wisdom, stung the\r\nscientist. He felt in the clergyman's reply not merely opposition, but\r\ninsult. His very pose was an affront.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know your motives, that is perfectly true, but I can infer\r\nthem. It is due me to say that I am not in the habit of mixing in\r\nwhere I am not wanted; but as Mr. and Mrs. Lambert have both asked my\r\nadvice, I shall give it. The girl is morbid and unhappy here, and I\r\nshall tell them to send her away for a time. She has musical talent. I\r\nshall advise them to allow her to go East to study.\"\r\n\r\nThe preacher's smile deepened into a sneer. \"I think I understand\r\n_your_ motives, and I shall oppose her going. What is there to\r\nrestrain a man who recognizes neither spirit nor God?\"\r\n\r\nServiss was at first astounded, then hot at the grossness of this\r\ninsinuation, and his strong, brown hands clinched in the instinct to\r\npunish--to retaliate--but his anger cooled to the level of words, and\r\nhe said: \"This interview has more than convinced me of the justice of\r\nLambert's distrust of you. I shall see him again and repeat the\r\nwarning I have already given.\" And with these words he turned and went\r\nout.\r\n\r\nIt was with a sense of astonishment and relief that he re-entered the\r\ndaylight, for the sunset glow was not yet out of the sky. A moment\r\nbefore the world had seemed enveloped in midnight darkness, and lo!\r\nhere now were the splendid peaks, the singing river, all aglow with\r\ngolden light. The encounter of the moment before receded swiftly,\r\nbecame incredible, but the preacher remained squat in his den like a\r\nvampire in his cave.\r\n\r\nAs he went slowly up the street he acknowledged a feeling of growing\r\nweight, of uncertainty. Having given his word in such wise, he had\r\nbecome the defender, the protector of one of whom he knew nothing that\r\nwas reassuring. His youth seemed to have suddenly taken on care. His\r\nvacation had ended in a cloud of distrust. From the detachment of the\r\nscientist he had descended to the level of a moralist and meddler,\r\nand, most significant of all, a meddler in the affairs of a young and\r\nattractive girl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nDR. BRITT EXPLAINS\r\n\r\n\r\nServiss had just written and sealed a letter to his sister, wherein he\r\nsaid, \"I shall remain a few days longer here in the mountains--they\r\ninterest me greatly,\" when a knock on the door announced the bell-boy\r\nbearing a card.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Britt!\" exclaimed Serviss, with pleasure. \"Bring him up, please,\"\r\nand to himself added, \"Now we will learn something definite about this\r\namazing group of people.\"\r\n\r\nThe manner in which Britt entered the room proclaimed a distinctive\r\ncharacter. He edged himself through the door, not stealthily, but\r\ncarelessly, casually. He, too, was tall, with a wide, dark beard\r\ncurling over very pink and rather plump cheeks, and in his bright\r\nblack eyes a sardonic sheen played as he loosely shook his host's\r\nhand. His expression was that of a man perpetually amused, as if\r\nanticipating a joke or recollecting a mockery. His voice was as\r\nlanguid as his limbs, but his words were precise and to their mark.\r\n\r\nServiss greeted him heartily. \"I am glad to meet you, Dr. Britt; take\r\na seat. I have heard of you through Miss Lambert.\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw you on the street,\" replied Britt, without change of\r\nexpression, \"so I looked over the register to find out who you were.\r\nI'm mighty glad to meet up with you. I know you very well by\r\nreputation, and Weissmann is an old acquaintance of our family's. What\r\nare you doing out here? Visiting the Lamberts?\"\r\n\r\nFor some reason this directness disturbed Serviss a little. \"No--oh\r\nno! I just drifted in over the divide from the desert, and met Miss\r\nLambert by accident, quite by accident. I dropped into Colorow to rest\r\nand rinse the desert dust away, before returning East. Turn about is\r\nfair play--what are you doing here?\"\r\n\r\nBritt struck his left breast with his thumb. \"Same old story--busted\r\nlung. Whenever you strike a suspicious character out here he's either\r\na 'one-lunger' or a 'remittance man.'\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what makes your country worth while.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know about that, but you'll find a good many of us waiting.\r\nWhen you fellows develop an anti-toxin for the consumption 'bug,'\r\nwe're all going back to God's country.\"\r\n\r\n\"We're hot on its trail,\" replied Serviss, jocularly.\r\n\r\n\"I know you are. I 'read after you,' as they say out here. In fact,\r\nI've got a little 'farm,' and take a shy at breeding the beasts\r\nmyself. I'd like you to come in and give me a hint or two.\"\r\n\r\n\"With pleasure,\" Serviss heartily responded. \"So you know Weissmann?\"\r\n\r\n\"I used to. My father was an attaché of the embassy at Berlin at one\r\ntime, and was a factor in getting old 'Hair and Goggles' to come\r\nover; he was a conceited ass at that time, with more wool than brains,\r\nthe governor always said; but the governor wanted to do something for\r\nthe college.\"\r\n\r\nServiss studied the card. \"Do I know your father?--is he still in\r\npublic life?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is not.\" Britt's glance veered. \"The governor, I'm sorry to say,\r\nhas a weakness for toddy, and I've retired him. He boards in White\r\nPlains with Patsy Cline summers, and relapses winters.\"\r\n\r\nServiss changed the subject. \"By-the-way, I want to ask you about this\r\nman Clarke. What kind of a chap is he?\"\r\n\r\nBritt's answer was languid but adequate. \"Three parts fakir and the\r\nrest fanatic.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was afraid so--and the Lamberts, what of them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Lambert is a dear old ninny. Viola is a mighty bright girl\r\nsuffering from a well-developed case of hysteria and auto-hypnosis.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Serviss, sharply.\r\n\r\nBritt checked himself. \"I ought not to speak of it, I suppose, but, as\r\nyou are a stranger and can keep a professional secret, I will explain.\r\nThe mother is a spiritualist--has been for years--and, being on the\r\nlookout for it, naturally discovered what she calls 'mediumship' in\r\nViola when a child. By carefully nursing the delusion in herself and\r\nin her subject, she has been able to develop a rare 'up-rush of the\r\nsubliminal,' as Myers would say. When I came here to take Dr.\r\nRandall's practice, I found among his papers elaborate notes on the\r\ngirl's development.\"\r\n\r\n\"You amaze me!\" exclaimed Serviss. \"She seems so normal and so\r\ncharming.\"\r\n\r\n\"In reality she's the most extraordinary puzzle I have ever undertaken\r\nto solve. It seems, according to Randall, that this power came upon\r\nher soon after the death of her little brother--a couple of years\r\nyounger than herself. I'll let you see these notes if you like.\r\nThey're very curious; in fact, I brought the book along--I wanted your\r\nopinion of them and your advice as to the girl's treatment.\"\r\n\r\nServiss leaned forward in growing interest. \"By all means let me see\r\nthe notes. You begin to throw light on something that puzzled me.\"\r\n\r\nBritt drew a small brown book from his pocket and said: \"Your first\r\nthought will be to relate this business to hysteria, and one of\r\nRandall's first entries is a reflection along these lines: 'There is\r\nmuch inconclusive literature on the shelves of medical libraries on\r\nthe subject of hysteria, and many diverse ailments are thrown into\r\nthat box of explanations.'\" Britt looked up. \"He's right there, but he\r\ngoes on to slate the medical profession thus: 'The mind of a child,\r\nlike any other expanding, growing thing, tends to depart from the\r\nnorm--loves apparently to surprise its progenitors. Holding in its\r\ngrasp latent tendencies of all ages, of all the race, it may at any\r\ntime astound by its sudden expansion in unexpected directions, as well\r\nas by its inexplicable failure to follow ordained grooves.'\" Here\r\nBritt paused again. \"You can see the old chap was hard hit. He now\r\ngets evolutionary. 'We are all goats, satyrs, and serpents\r\npotentially--even from the neurologist's point of view our minds are\r\ninfinitely complex.'\"\r\n\r\nServiss said, \"All this is wise, but is it pertinent?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's coming at it. 'Now, what we men of medicine call hysteria seems\r\nto be a violent and, in a sense, unaccountable departure from the\r\nnorm, induced by the removal of some check--by some deep change in the\r\nnervous constitution. Thus a girl suddenly refuses to eat, has\r\nvisions, shouts, and sings uncontrollably, perhaps speaks in an\r\nunknown tongue--she is said to be hysterical. A mother, hearing of the\r\ndeath of her child, begins to laugh, passes at length into a\r\ncataleptic state, during which a child's voice sounds from her throat;\r\nthis, too, is hysteria. A man of forty-five becomes melancholy,\r\nprofesses to hear music inaudible to others, develops automatic\r\nwriting, and trances in which he is able to hear distant voices, and\r\nto read sealed letters; this, too, is hysteria. In reality, nothing is\r\nexplained.'\"\r\n\r\n\"What of it?\" interrupted Serviss. \"Let's have the application.\"\r\n\r\n\"He makes his point in the next paragraph: 'In conformity with this\r\nhabit, when called in by Mrs. Lambert to study her daughter, who had\r\npassed suddenly into deep sleep and was speaking with the voice of her\r\ngrandfather, I, with owlish gravity, pronounced her attack a case of\r\nhysteria. \"Take her on a little trip,\" said I. \"Keep her well\r\nnourished and out-of-doors, and she will outgrow it.\"'\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good advice.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it was, but mark the sequel: '_She did not outgrow it._' He puts\r\nthis in italics. 'The power within her gained in mastery, and, what is\r\nmost singular and baffling to me, she continues to be a hearty,\r\nhealthy child in all other ways, and yet at times she seems the calm\r\ncentre of a whirlwind of invisible forces. Chairs, books, thimbles,\r\neven the piano, move to and fro without visible pushing. Electric\r\nsnapping is heard in the carpet under her little feet, and loud\r\nknocking comes upon the walls--'\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Serviss, and recalled the knocking at his first visit,\r\nwhile the girl was at the piano.\r\n\r\n\"Here he drops into italics again. '_One by one all the familiar\r\nmanifestations of the spiritualistic medium are being reproduced by\r\nthis pretty maiden here in this mountain home._'\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord, what a pity!\" exclaimed Serviss.\r\n\r\nBritt read on: \"'The mother, aggrieved and alarmed by the rude way in\r\nwhich the girl is buffeted, has been put to her paces to conceal the\r\ntopsy-turvy doings of her household. Stones are hurled through the\r\nwindows, cabinets are opened by invisible and silent locksmiths, _and\r\nI have seen these things and can offer no explanation_.'\" Britt closed\r\nthe book. \"Right here the old doctor lost his nerve, up to this time\r\nhe was a fairly acute observer. His next entry is evidently some weeks\r\nor, possibly, months later. He says: 'Slowly we have learned to\r\nunderstand the phenomena, but we cannot control them, and the child is\r\nstill cruelly embarrassed by intrusive tappings and cracklings as she\r\nvisits her friends or as she sits in her seat in school. She has\r\nbecome afraid to sleep alone, and calls piteously for a light whenever\r\nthe noises begin.'\"\r\n\r\n\"The poor child--\"\r\n\r\n\"You may well say that,\" replied Britt. \"She has told me that her time\r\nof greatest trial comes just after the family have had their evening\r\nmeal, and while she is seated at her book; but Randall grows eloquent\r\nin his description of what took place: 'Almost every night at seven\r\no'clock the obscure powers begin their uncanny and invisible riot,\r\nending by seizing upon the child as if to destroy her, compelling her\r\nin the end to sleep. Then her voice, her limbs, seem at the disposal\r\nof some invisible intelligence.' You see, the old man is weakening. He\r\nsays no more of hysteria, and nothing about taking the girl away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to tell me he joined in fostering this delusion?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mark his change of tone. He goes on: 'The mother, convinced by her\r\nreading, as well as by messages in writing, believes that the spirits\r\nof her dead are trying to communicate with her, and so sits night\r\nafter night terrified yet hoping, waiting for further instructions\r\nfrom the imponderable ones.'\" Britt turned a few pages rapidly.\r\n\"Listen to this. Here is the key to the old man's change of heart:\r\n'To-night the child began to speak to me in the voice of a man.\r\nHoarse words rose from deep in her throat, a voice and words\r\nimpossible to her in her normal condition. The voice purported to be\r\nmy father's. It is all very singular. I do not understand how she\r\ncould know the things this voice uttered to me.' You see,\" said Britt,\r\n\"he has ceased to be the medical adviser.\" He turned a number of pages\r\nslowly. \"Well, the girl passed rapidly through these various phases,\r\naccording to Randall. She wrote messages with her left hand, wherein\r\nher grandfather McLeod detailed the method of treating her, and\r\nRandall was so far gone that he acquiesced. From her eleventh to her\r\nfifteenth year she lived under this 'control.' The manifestations\r\nincreased in power and definiteness. The 'controls' at last were\r\nthree--her grandfather, her brother, and her own father. At sixteen\r\nthe most violent of the manifestations ceased, and the girl went away\r\nto school. At this point Joe Lambert enters--he married the mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did he take these doings?\"\r\n\r\n\"He seems to have been a silent and reluctant witness; the doctor only\r\nmentions him incidentally. There are one or two pitiful letters from\r\nthe girl written while at school, detailing several embarrassing\r\nreturns of the 'spirits,' but, on the whole, she was happy. According\r\nto the record, her vacations must have been a torment, for 'Waltie,'\r\nthat's no _Polter-geist_, seemed determined to make up for lost time.\r\nHe came every night, making life a hell for his sister. She could go\r\nnowhere, and it was with the greatest difficulty that the mother kept\r\nher dreadful secret.\"\r\n\r\nServiss, with darkened brow, writhed uneasily in his chair. \"I have\r\nheard of these things before now, but this is a new view of a medium's\r\ndevelopment. I don't understand the mother's attitude.\"\r\n\r\n\"Randall notes that the mother was resigned and content as soon as she\r\nwas convinced of the return of her dead father and husband and son,\r\nand at present will not think of giving up her fancied communion,\r\nespecially as the 'guides' constantly assure her that 'they' will\r\nprotect the girl. But observe the senility of this note in Randall's\r\ndiary: 'Martha comes regularly to me now, and I am happy in a renewed\r\nsense of her companionship. Indeed, I fancy at times that I can see\r\nher. She showed me her hands last night; I could see them plainly\r\nagainst the window. I had quite a controversy with Lambert after the\r\nsitting. \"It's all bad business,\" he said. \"I am scared when I think\r\nof what's going to become of Viola. Here she is growing to be a big\r\ngirl, and a pretty girl, and she ought to be out in company--she ought\r\nto be singing and dancing like other girls. She ought to marry like\r\nother girls and be happy, and she can't be so long as these things are\r\ngoing on. It isn't right.\"'\"\r\n\r\n\"No more was it,\" said Serviss. \"It was villainous.\"\r\n\r\n\"Randall was too far gone to even agree. 'But it hasn't hurt her,' I\r\nreplied; 'and, indeed, this marvellous fact resigns me to the\r\npractice. I can't endure now the thought of being cut off from Martha\r\nand Paul, our precious boy. It would be like shutting the door in\r\ntheir faces. Besides, they are in control; we could not stop their\r\nuse of the girl if we were to try. As for me, it is now my life. I am\r\nold. My friends, my dear ones, are all on that side. I have only a few\r\nmore days to live, and then--' Right here the old man stopped. He\r\nlived a month or two after that, but he made no more notes, and when I\r\ncame on the scene Clarke was in control of the situation. I had no\r\nacquaintance with the family and no personal knowledge of the case\r\ntill Lambert called one day and told me of the sittings going on in\r\nthe little cottage. He had a notion that I might be able to cure the\r\ngirl.\"\r\n\r\nServiss had listened to Britt with growing pain and indignation--pain\r\nat thought of Viola's undoing, indignation that the mother and her\r\nphysician could so complacently join in the dark proceedings. \"Of\r\ncourse, you took hold of the case.\"\r\n\r\n\"I tried to, but Mrs. Lambert and Clarke would not admit that the girl\r\nwas in need of my care. They invited me to join the circle as a\r\nspectator, which I did. I am still the onlooker--merely.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean to say they are still experimenting with her?\"\r\n\r\n\"You may call it that. They sit regularly two or three nights each\r\nweek. Clarke is preparing to renounce his pulpit and startle the world\r\nby a book on 'spiritism,' as he calls his faith. The girl is his\r\nsource of thunder.\"\r\n\r\nServiss sank back into his chair and darkly pondered. \"That explains a\r\nnumber of very strange words and actions on the girl's part. What is\r\nher attitude? She seemed to me extremely discontented and unhappy.\"\r\n\r\n\"She _is_ unhappy. She understands her situation and has moments of\r\nrebellion. She knows that she is cut off from her rightful share in\r\nthe world of young people, and feels accursed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can understand that, and several things she said to me corroborate\r\nyour analysis of her feeling. But tell me--you have attended these\r\nsittings--what takes place--what does the girl profess to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. I can't determine Clarke's share in the hocus-pocus. It\r\nall takes place in the dark.\"\r\n\r\n\"It always does. It belongs there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Many of the good old 'stunts' of the professional medium are\r\nreproduced. Lights dance about, guitars are played, chairs nose about\r\nyour knees, hands are laid on your cheek, and so on.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't think she is wilfully tricking?\" Serviss asked this with\r\nmanifest anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"There's every inducement--darkness, deeply anxious friends. It would\r\nnot be strange if she did 'help on' now and then.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a deplorable thing!\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet I'm not so sure that she wilfully deceives, though I have\r\ndetected her in fraud. Probably the whole thing began in some childish\r\ndisorder which threw her system out of balance. There are hundreds of\r\nsuch cases in medical literature. She was 'possessed,' as of old, with\r\na sort of devilish 'secondary personality.' She probably wrote\r\ntreatises left-handed and upside-down. They often begin that way. The\r\nmother, lately bereaved, was convinced of her daughter's occult\r\npowers. She nursed the delusion, formed a circle, sat in the darkness,\r\npetting the girl when things happened, mourning when the walls were\r\nsilent--and there you are! 'Sludge the Medium' all over again, in a\r\nsmall way. Probably the girl didn't intend to deceive anybody at\r\nfirst, but she was tolled along from one fakery to another, till at\r\nlast she found herself powerless in the grasp of her self-induced\r\ncoma. She is anxious to escape her slavery; she revolts, and is most\r\nunhappy, but sees no way out. That's my present understanding of the\r\ncase. Now, what is your advice? What can I do? I am deeply interested\r\nin the girl, but I have no authority to act.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shock and disgust me,\" said Serviss, profoundly moved. \"The girl\r\nseems too fine for such chicanery. Who is this man Clarke?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was a sensational preacher in Brooklyn a few years ago, but a\r\nhemorrhage in the pulpit cut short his career in the East. He came out\r\nhere and got better, but his wife, who had a weak heart, couldn't\r\nstand the altitude. She died--a sacrifice to her husband. He's the\r\nkind of a man who demands sacrifice. After his wife's death, he fairly\r\nlived at the Lambert cottage, and is now in full control. The girl's\r\nwill is so weakened that she is but a puppet in the grasp of his\r\npowerful personality.\"\r\n\r\nServiss was now absorbed in reconstructing his conception of Viola.\r\nHer situation appealed to him with the greatest poignancy, but his\r\nability to help her seemed gone. Fair as she looked, she was to be\r\navoided, as one tainted with leprosy. His impression that first\r\nafternoon had been true--she was beleaguered, if not lost.\r\n\r\nBritt was saying: \"If the girl were under age I'd appeal to the health\r\nauthorities of the state--I really would, much as I like Mrs.\r\nLambert--but she is of age, and, what is more to the point, Clarke has\r\nwon her love and confidence, and what can you do? He fills her\r\nhorizon, and the mother favors him. He talks to her of her daughter's\r\n'mission to the world,' and such-like vapor, and has the girl herself\r\nhalf convinced that her cataleptic states are of divine origin. I\r\nconfess I haven't felt free to make any real tests--you can't treat\r\nher like a professional, you know--but she seems to have induced by\r\nlong practice a genuine coma, and until some clamp is applied I can't\r\nsay whether she or Clarke is the chief offender. Now what would you\r\ndo?\"\r\n\r\nServiss burned with the heat of his anger. \"Don't reveal to me any\r\nmore of this wretched business. I can't advise. If you, her physician,\r\nand Lambert, her step-father, can't put a stop to it, what can I, a\r\npassing stranger, do? I don't want to know anything more about it.\r\nWhy, man, it's diabolical! To warp and imprison a girl like that! To\r\nthink of that bewitching creature as a common trickster--appalls me.\r\nAnd to think that good people, millions of them, believe in such\r\nmummery! It is incredible!\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd be surprised at the number of somewhat similar cases we find\r\namong our patients. Since coming here I've gone in for a little\r\nlibrary of books on the subject. Every physician during his practice\r\ncomes upon one or more of these abnormal cases which, as Randall says,\r\nwe label, for convenience, '_hysteria_,' and I'm free to say that I\r\ndon't think we're at the bottom of the matter. Let's be just to this\r\ngirl. There are points in her favor.\"\r\n\r\nServiss protested. \"Not another word. It's too painful.\"\r\n\r\nBritt persisted. \"I was merely going to say that I think there is some\r\nbasis for all this humbuggery. These mediums don't start from nothing.\r\nThey nearly all begin with some abnormality. Some submerged power\r\nrises to the surface of their minds like a sea-serpent, and that\r\ndistinguishes them as seers. Curious friends crowd around, then the\r\nlying begins. It's going to be worth while to take the subject up,\r\nby-and-by. I'd do it myself if I could live in New York City.\" He\r\nrose. \"Well, I don't blame you for not going into this case--I wish I\r\nwere clear of it myself--but I was hoping you'd had some experience\r\nthat would help me.\" Thereupon the conversation shifted to other\r\ngrounds.\r\n\r\nAfter Britt went out Serviss sat in brooding uneasiness over his\r\nvisitor's sad revelations. He had known Viola Lambert but three days,\r\nand yet these revelations concerning her affected him most painfully,\r\nquite vitally. His pleasure in her and in the mother and their pretty\r\nhome was utterly gone, and the breaking-off of this acquaintance left\r\nan ache in his heart.\r\n\r\nOf course he put all this on very general grounds. \"I hate to lose\r\nfaith in any one. It is a shock to know that I can be so wholly\r\ndeceived by appearance. Clarke is really the one to blame in the\r\ndeception. I can't believe the girl wilfully deceives, and yet Britt\r\nwas explicit, and he seems to be a keen, dispassionate observer.\"\r\n\r\nThereupon he began to pack in order to take the early morning train\r\nfor the East. He decided not to see her again, and posted a polite\r\nnote saying he had been obliged to return to New York, and that he\r\nregretted his inability to call.\r\n\r\nAs he stood on the rear platform of his train next day, looking back\r\nup the cañon towards the shining crest of Colorow, he had a craven\r\nsense of having deserted a helpless young girl in the hour of her\r\ngreatest trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nANTHONY CLARKE, EVANGEL\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Britt was right. Mrs. Lambert was very fond of Clarke--had,\r\nindeed, quite taken him into her heart. He was at once son and\r\nspiritual adviser, and his wishes had the force of commands. His\r\nbereavement could not have anguished her much more keenly had Adele\r\nbeen her own daughter, and this affliction still lay like a mist\r\nbetween them, preventing even a foreboding of his impending confession\r\nof desire. Her remembrance of the beauty and high character of his\r\nwife made Viola seem doubly the child; and so when, from time to time,\r\nsome busybody hinted at the minister's marked intimacy with her\r\ndaughter, she put the covert insinuation away with a frank word--\"You\r\nmustn't even think such a thing.\"\r\n\r\nViola, too, from the very beginning of their acquaintance, had admired\r\nthe young minister quite as deeply as Serviss imagined, and had\r\nhumbled herself before Adele as to a very wonderful lady of the\r\nmysterious outer world, whose deportment, dress, and speech had been\r\nsources of enlightenment; and when she passed away, the land of the\r\nshadow became just that much richer, more complete in its dominion\r\nover her. Almost at once Adele spoke through the vale, saying, \"I am\r\nhere to help and guide.\"\r\n\r\nThus all powers of earth and heaven had combined to make Clarke the\r\nruler of Viola Lambert's little world. He stood between her and young\r\nClinton Ward and all other suitors--he absorbed her thought. She\r\nadmired his gifts, and trembled beneath the power of his dark eyes,\r\nhis magnetic hands, and especially responded to the music of his deep\r\nvoice, which was very enthralling when it took on the pleading melody\r\nof the lover. At times he filled her with such passion of vague unrest\r\nthat life became a torment, for she was of the age when the world is\r\nfor the lover's conquest, and the cadence of love's song means most\r\nand is least understood; and yet at times she felt a fear of him which\r\nchilled her. She was struggling, too, with growing ambitions, and with\r\nan expanding knowledge of the world which was beginning to make her\r\ncritical--the wonder of the child was giving place to the insight of\r\nthe woman. The wish to shake off her invisible tormentors and be like\r\nother girls was in reality a demand for the right to be loved and\r\nvalued for her own natural self, entirely free from the touch of\r\nspectral hands.\r\n\r\nShe was disappointed that Clarke did not understand and sympathize\r\nwith this wish, but that he desired her in marriage had never once\r\nentered her mind. He was a minister, and she reverenced his office,\r\nand, besides, she considered herself but a girl, too ignorant and too\r\ntrivial to be the wife of one so high in holy service.\r\n\r\nWith the coming of the young professor a new force seemed entered upon\r\nthe saner side of her life. She recognized in him a master of the\r\ngreat outer world--the Eastern world, the world of the unafraid--and\r\nher determination to at least subordinate her \"controls\" had expanded\r\nswiftly to a most dangerous height during the few hours of her\r\ncompanionship with him. She felt that he would sympathize with\r\nher--that he would help her. The clear positiveness of his speech, his\r\nhealth, his humor, grew upon her each moment, and she resolved to\r\nconfide in him when next they met.\r\n\r\nPart of this upspringing revolt, this antagonism, Clarke divined, and\r\nthe determination to arrest her purpose, the desire to possess her\r\nentirely and at once, excluded every other wish or plan, and to feel\r\nwas to act with Anthony Clarke, for he was born to emotional\r\nexperience as the sparks fly upward. He had ever been a creature of\r\nunreason, morbidly conscious of self--and naturally, for in him\r\nstruggled the blood of three races. His father was Scotch, and his\r\nmother--Spanish on the spindle side and Irish by way of a most\r\nmercurial father--remained an unsolved problem all her days, even to\r\nher husband. Her laughter was as illogical as her tears. Her household\r\ncould never tell what the next hour would bring forth, so ready were\r\nher sympathies, so instant her despairs. She lived all her life at the\r\nheights or the depths, with never a day of serene, womanly, reasonable\r\naction, and when she died her passing was of the same emotional\r\nstress. She clung to earth like one whose body was about to drop into\r\nsoundless deeps.\r\n\r\nHer son had inherited all her fervency, her inconstancy of purpose, as\r\nwell as her tendency to collapse under pressure. Physically he had\r\nalways been of slender figure, with weak lungs, and these weaknesses\r\nhe had used to free himself from work, from responsibility.\r\n\r\nHe was not a hypocrite--in that Britt was mistaken. He was by nature\r\ndeeply religious. His soul aspired, at times, to high things. He was\r\nsympathetic to actual pain, and had always been morbidly in awe of\r\ndeath. The sight of any poor, lost, and suffering man threw him into\r\ninstant, profound, and melancholy pity. A dead beetle in the road, a\r\nfly caught in a spider's web, a young robin water-soaked and\r\nbedraggled, appalled him, even as a boy, and he pondered them with sad\r\nand questioning eyes long after his young companions had forgotten\r\nthem. Where had the light of their eyes fled? he asked himself. He\r\nfound no sport in killing any creature, and more than once he used all\r\nhis slender force to defend a cat from stoning; and yet he was known\r\nto have joined the worst youths of his native town in secret\r\ndrinking-bouts, thereby acquiring the reputation of a liar and sneak,\r\nas well as that of licentiate. At seventeen, just when the appetite\r\nfor liquor seemed beyond his control, a great \"revivalist\" won his\r\nsoul, as the saying went, and at twenty-three he assumed his first\r\npastorate.\r\n\r\nSuccess as a pulpit orator was assured by the charm of his voice, the\r\nmagnetism of his manner. His head was singularly handsome, and often\r\nwhen he spoke his face was irradiated like that of a seraph, and the\r\nwomen of all his congregations adored him from the first glance,\r\nembarrassing him with their ardent praises. That he had remained\r\nfaithful to his wife in spite of this adoration was evidence of her\r\ngreat beauty of character. She was, indeed, his safeguard and his\r\nhourly monitor while she lived.\r\n\r\nFor him she had sacrificed all her friends in the East. She came to\r\nthe mountains without a murmur, she bore with him, cheered him, upheld\r\nhim in a hundred ways--and when she died his world went black as\r\nmidnight. It was as if in the midst of a monster, interminable cavern\r\nhis one starlike light had gone out in his hand. For days he beat his\r\nhead against the wall, crying defiant curses against his God; but in\r\nthe end he sank into voiceless despair. Then it was, as he lay prone\r\nand passive, that he began to hear mysterious whisperings and tappings\r\non the walls of his cavern of despond. He rose and listened. He groped\r\nhis way towards the dim light. He returned to the world of men. His\r\nfaith in the Scriptures was weakened; but he soon discovered a\r\nwondrous change of heart towards those who claimed to be\r\nintermediaries between the worlds of matter and of spirit. He turned\r\nhis attention to the study of the physical evidences of life after\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nUp to that moment he had given but little credence to Mrs. Lambert's\r\nhalf-hearted confidences concerning her own change of faith, and, as\r\nViola had been away at school much of the time, he had forgotten that\r\nshe was concerned in the mother's confession.\r\n\r\nThe disclosure of her powers, as he told Dr. Britt--after they were\r\nboth involved in the curious case--came violently, without warning, a\r\nfew days after Adele's death. \"I was sitting with Mrs. Lambert in sad\r\nconversation, seeking her aid and comfort. Viola occupied a low chair\r\nbeside the shaded lamp, a book upon her knee. She was listening to me.\r\nI had just finished saying, in deeply passionate tones, 'I would give\r\nall my hope of life for one whisper from the lips of my Adele,' when\r\nthe room began to darken. At first I thought the effect lay in my own\r\nbrain, but a moment later I perceived that the light had actually\r\nbegun to fail. We all watched it in silence for a moment, then Mrs.\r\nLambert remarked, 'Viola, Mary forgot to fill the lamp.'\r\n\r\n\"Even as she spoke a cool wind blew over my head and lay along my\r\nhands. The flame leaped into the air, the room went black, save where\r\na pale glow coming from the street lay upon the floor. A faint\r\nrustling arose, a hand touched my cheek, soft lips brushed my ear, and\r\na whisper that stopped the beating of my heart began. A vague,\r\ninarticulate murmur, at first; but at last I plainly heard my\r\nspirit-wife speaking in gentle reproof--'Tony, Tony, I am always with\r\nyou.'\r\n\r\n\"The whisper ceased. The hand was taken away. A deep sigh came to my\r\near. My Adele was gone! The moment of ecstasy was over. I sat stunned,\r\ninert, my brain whirling with the far-reaching import of this\r\nexperience. Before I could drag myself to my feet Mrs. Lambert,\r\npractical and undisturbed, threw open the door and let the light of\r\nthe street in. Only then, as I looked on Viola, lying in trance with\r\nwhite, set face, did I first connect her in any way with my sweet\r\ncommunion with Adele.\r\n\r\n\"Then, like a flash of joyous light irradiating my soul, came the\r\nconviction that she was the medium through whom my Adele had\r\nspoken--that she had opened the gates of silence for me.\r\n\r\n\"I was no longer body--I was a brain suspended in some invisible sea\r\nof force. Here was the reality of religion. Here was the answer to the\r\nanguished cry of humanity--an answer to my prayers which the Hebrew\r\nScriptures could not give. There _was_ a life beyond the grave. The\r\nspirit _did_ persist after the decay of the body. And here in this\r\nlittle room, when my despair was deepest, the proof had come, blinding\r\nme with its beauty.\r\n\r\n\"Then I said: 'Viola, you have given me the most wonderful moment of\r\nall my life. You brought my Adele and put her hand in mine. Through\r\nyou I heard her voice again. God has chosen you for a great work; I\r\nfeel it. You should not repel these powers; your gift may mean the\r\nmost exquisite comfort to thousands--nay, millions--of bereaved\r\nsouls.'\r\n\r\n\"I was amazed at the vehement unreason of her reply. 'I don't want\r\nit!' she cried. 'I hate it! I won't sit again!' Then I tried to\r\npersuade her of her great mission, to no result. The following night\r\nI came, and we pleaded with her to act again with us, but she still\r\npassionately refused. 'Why don't they come to you or to mother,' she\r\ncomplained, 'instead of to me?' To this I said: 'There is no answer.\r\nThey have made you their instrument, and it is your duty to do their\r\nwill.'\r\n\r\n\"That night the little parlor became a battle-field. Mrs. Lambert had\r\ninvoked the aid of Donald McLeod, her father, the girl's 'control.'\r\nViola resisted almost to the death. It seemed as if a strong hand\r\nclutched her throat, commanding obedience. I feared she would be torn\r\nto pieces, and at last I protested. 'She is suffering too much; let us\r\ngive over the sitting.' But Mrs. Lambert said, quietly: 'It is her own\r\nfault. She is being punished for her obstinacy. Father is disciplining\r\nher--he will not harm her.' In the end the power conquered, and the\r\ngirl lay back in slumber so deep, so dead, that her breath seemed\r\nstilled forever--her hands icily inert, her face as white as marble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you interfere?\" asked Britt, sternly.\r\n\r\n\"How could I, when the mother and the girl's 'controls' were minded\r\notherwise? Besides, I began to believe in the girl's mission--I began\r\nto understand the enormous value of her work. My God, Dr. Britt, had I\r\nthat girl's gift I would engross the world. I would write such words\r\nacross the tomb that death would seem as sweet as baby slumber. I\r\nwould make the grave a gateway to the light. I would eliminate sorrow\r\nfrom the earth. The Bible no longer satisfies me. I want something\r\nmore than cold, black letters on a printed page. I want to know! I\r\nwant to thrill the world with a new message; and here, now, at my\r\nhand, is a medium. I can never have this power--perhaps it is only\r\ngiven to babes and to sucklings, but I can spread the light. You, Dr.\r\nBritt, shall help me. Let us study this wonderful gift. Let us\r\nconcentrate our energies upon this supreme problem. I will note all\r\nthat comes to us, and I will write a burning book--a revelation that\r\nshall go round the globe, guiding and gladdening every human soul.\r\nThink of it! There is no mightier mission on earth. This girl can be,\r\nand must be, made a savior, a hope-bringer, to thousands of despairing\r\nsouls!\"\r\n\r\nTo this fervid appeal Britt remained impassive and coldly\r\ncritical--till, chilled and repelled, Clarke had withdrawn his\r\nconfidence. The two still met occasionally in Mrs. Lambert's home, but\r\ntheir antagonism had deepened to actual hatred. Britt, impotent to\r\nhelp, had long since ceased to protest, even to the girl herself; for\r\nhe had learned that every revolt on her part brought keener pain and\r\ndeeper humiliation in its train. He entered upon a study of the\r\nsubject, and thus far had found little to encourage the hope of the\r\ngirl's redemption from her maladies.\r\n\r\nClarke, too, had surrounded himself with every available book which\r\nbore upon these baffling phases of human experiences, and had put\r\nhimself in touch with every society organized for the investigation of\r\noccult phenomena--and in his dark little den brooded day and night\r\nover the dimly apprehended laws of the unseen universe. He left his\r\nstudies only to be with Viola, who had become as necessary to him as\r\nhis daily food--as indispensable as air. She was at once his hope and\r\nhis very present help. How to keep her, how to mould her to his will,\r\nhow to use her to his great purpose of ridding the world of the fear\r\nof death--these became his hourly care, his only interest.\r\n\r\nTo these ends he strove to enthrall her by his singing, by his\r\noratory, and by his love of poetry, knowing well that to drum\r\nconstantly upon the harsh string of her \"mission\" would revolt her;\r\nand she, thus beset, thus beleaguered, gave over her rebellion,\r\nresigning herself to her guides till this ruddy and powerful young man\r\nof science came into her world to fill her with new determination to\r\nescape from her mental slavery.\r\n\r\nClarke loved this girl, not as he had loved Adele, of course, but\r\nquite as humanly. Her mediumship, so vital to the world, so sacred in\r\nhis eyes, had but added to her allurement. \"All that I am, and all I\r\nhope to be, is bound up in the possession of that sweet, wonderful\r\nchild,\" he said, in acknowledgment of his discovery. In a very subtle\r\nway he now apprehended a change in the girl, and, realizing how\r\nutterly his aims, his daily happiness, his future depended upon her,\r\nhe rose from his seat resolved not merely to advise against her going\r\naway, but to claim her as his own--his wife.\r\n\r\n\"My wife!\" At this deeply significant word Adele's pleading face rose\r\nvividly before him. Writhing with shame before her reproachful glance,\r\nhe cried out: \"But I cannot live alone! And then consider--I shall be\r\nable to meet you each day, perhaps each hour, and as I myself develop\r\nin grace of soul I may come to you without any medium. I am not\r\ndisloyal to you, Adele. I love this girl, I confess that; but not as I\r\nloved you. You were my true wife, the only spouse I can ever have--you\r\nfilled my soul. My love for this girl is that of a father--a teacher.\r\nI need her for--Oh, my Adele, I will confess, before you came back to\r\nme through this child I was weary of the earth, ready to violently end\r\nmy anguish. Viola put your hand again in mine--she gave me to hear\r\nyour voice. I cannot bear to lose those priceless moments, and yet I\r\nmust do so if she goes from me. Am I not justified in desiring her\r\npresence? Come to me; tell me, to-night, what you would have me do. Be\r\nmerciful, my angel spouse. Remember my empty, desolate heart. Remember\r\nthe greatness of the work I have set myself to do. Oh, my sweet\r\nspirit, if you could only put an arm about my neck _now_, without any\r\nother interposing soul! Come to me, whisper to me--now! Let me know\r\nyour presence here as I sit alone and despairing--\"\r\n\r\nHe ceased to pray, and bowed his head upon his desk and waited in an\r\nagony of hope--waited while the darkness deepened and the splendid\r\neternal song of the river proclaimed the futility and folly of man. A\r\ncricket sang with heart-piercing cheer, as if to say, \"I die\r\nto-morrow, but I never despair.\" But no silken rustle, no whispering\r\nvoice came to still the agony welling in bitter sighs from the lips of\r\nthe tempted man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nCLARKE'S WOOING\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Lambert was face to face with a decision of almost equal\r\nmoment--was, indeed, in the midst of formulating the question which\r\nperplexed her, in order that she might lay it before her invisible\r\nguides for their consideration. She had just written upon a slate\r\nthese words: \"Shall I take Viola and go East, or shall I send her on\r\nalone?\" when Clarke's foot was heard outside her door. Hastily hiding\r\nthe slate, she rose to meet her visitor.\r\n\r\nHe was very pale, and something in his glance made her aware that his\r\ncall was of no ordinary intent.\r\n\r\n\"Where is Viola?\" he asked, abruptly.\r\n\r\n\"She has gone to the street with a friend. She will return soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad you are alone; I want to talk with you. I don't like the\r\ncondition of mind Viola is in to-day. The coming of this Eastern\r\nprofessor seems to have stirred her to another fit of restless desire\r\nto go away. I can't think of this, Julia; she is too precious to me to\r\nlose. She has become a part of my very heart's blood, and I am afraid\r\nto let her go out of my sight. She is young and very impressionable.\r\nIf she goes away into the city we may both lose her forever. The time\r\nhas come to tell you that I love her--not precisely as I loved Adele,\r\nbut deeply, passionately. I want her as my wife. I ask your consent to\r\ntell her so--to-night. Will you give that permission?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lambert gazed up at him with such fixity of surprise that the\r\nrush of his forthright appeal weakened towards its end. She was\r\noverwhelmed by the intensity of passion in his voice, as well as by\r\nsurprise that he, so soon after his bitter loss, could turn to\r\nanother--to her daughter, a child. And, at last, she whispered, \"What\r\nwill _they_ say, Anthony?\"\r\n\r\nThis question he had anticipated, and his reply was ready. \"_They_\r\nwill advise it, I am sure. For does it not fit to their purpose? Does\r\nnot my great book depend on Viola's daily co-operation? I have no fear\r\nof _their_ answer; I fear what she will say.\" He began to pace up and\r\ndown the room. \"What, from _their_ point of view, does her musical\r\neducation signify? Think of it! She holds the key to the gates of\r\ndeath. On her the hopes of millions hang. She is the most wonderful\r\norganism in this world--so normal in all other ways, so trustworthy.\r\nShe will convince all who come into her presence; and then, have not\r\nher 'controls' chosen me to publish their discoveries to the world? It\r\nis ordained that we work together in this way. She must not go to New\r\nYork, that vast caldron which destroys all that is spiritual. She\r\nshould go only when closely guarded by those who love her and\r\nunderstand her exquisite nature, her gifts. Some day I will take her\r\nthere. Alone she will be prevented from her grand mission, her message\r\nlost, her faith destroyed. Can't you see she must not go?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have done my best to keep her.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know you have,\" he answered, quickly; \"and now you must give me\r\nauthority over her--the authority of a husband. I am willing to put\r\nthe whole matter to the test this night. She knows that I love her,\r\nand I think she honors and respects me--perhaps she may already love\r\nme, unworthy as I am.\"\r\n\r\nThe mother began now to tremble. \"I don't know, Anthony; she\r\nthought--we all understood--that you--\"\r\n\r\n\"I know what you mean,\" he irritably exclaimed. \"Why will you persist\r\nin misreading me? I am not disloyal to Adele. Can't you see that my\r\ndevotion for her remains, and that my regard for Viola is no treason\r\nto the dead? Adele will understand how vital, how necessary, Viola is\r\nto me, for does she not know that I could not even communicate with\r\nher if Viola went away? I do not love Viola as a boy loves, but as a\r\nman who understands himself and her--as one who understands her\r\nduties. It is a different love, but it is just as true, and it is high\r\nand holy. Without her I would have gone mad. She saved me from\r\ndespair. Her union with me will make her an evangel to the earth-bound\r\nmillions.\"\r\n\r\nFlattered as well as awed by this disclosure of her daughter's power,\r\nthe mother consented to his demand. Marriage with him would\r\nsafe-harbor Viola, would establish her in life, and would also carry\r\nforward the work which she, too, considered of greater importance than\r\nany other concern of her life.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know her mind, Anthony,\" she said, after a silence. \"She\r\nworries and puzzles me lately by her opposition to all our plans; but\r\nI don't think she is attached to any of the young men she knows.\r\nStill, she is not one to speak of such things. And if she consents--\"\r\n\r\n\"When she comes, leave her to me,\" answered he, with returning\r\nconfidence. Deep in the man's egotistic soul lay the thought, \"I know\r\nwhy this girl is restless and uneasy--I know why she seeks afar off;\r\nit is because she thinks me indissolubly bound to Adele. When she\r\nfinds that I love her, that I want her for my wife, she will come--her\r\nvague rebellions will cease. Her longings will close round me--\"\r\n\r\nWhen the door opened and Viola stepped into the room, so tall, so\r\nvivid, so tingling with life, the very force of his desire rendered\r\nClarke outwardly humble, drove him to a feigning of sadness and to the\r\nvoicing of desolate weakness. After the mother left them alone he\r\nbegan speaking in a low voice with deep-dropping cadences.\r\n\r\n\"Viola, I have something important to say to you. I am much disturbed\r\nover your renewed determination to go away. In the face of the great\r\nwork which is yours to do I do not understand how you can think of\r\ndropping it in mid-air, so to speak, to go away on an errand which is\r\nessentially selfish--as well as most unwise and full of danger. I\r\ndon't understand this renewal of restlessness on your part.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl's face was clouded, for she had just learned of Serviss's\r\ndeparture and was deeply hurt. She drew the pin from her hat and\r\nsilently laid it on the table, and in this gesture was something of\r\nthe resolution of the warrior who divests himself of his cumbering\r\nplumed helmet. \"It's very simple,\" she curtly answered. \"I want to get\r\naway from here for a while. I can't endure my life here any longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not? Why are you so unhappy?\" he asked, with an accent of stern\r\nreproof. \"It is a beautiful land--you are among your own people, you\r\nhave your music, your work, and you are young. You ought to be happy.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just it,\" she interrupted, quite fiercely. \"It is because I am\r\nyoung that I want to do something. It seems to me to-day as if I were\r\nlosing the best years of my life here in this little town, and I want\r\nto get away. I _must_ get away!\"\r\n\r\n\"Does your work with me seem of no value?\" His glowing eyes sought\r\nhers. He approached her. \"Do I weary you? Am I an irritation?\"\r\n\r\nHer face softened. \"No, you have helped me very much. I couldn't have\r\nendured this life without you and my music; but this other life--these\r\nsittings--I can't go on with them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you feel that you must? Don't you feel their enormous\r\nimportance?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't! I begin to doubt myself--everybody. What have _they_\r\ndone for you, for anybody, that I should sacrifice nay whole life to\r\nthem and their wishes?\"\r\n\r\n\"They brought me healing; they made Dr. Randall happy in his last\r\nyears; they are a daily solace to your mother; they will comfort\r\nmillions through our agency.\" He bent towards her. \"Viola, my girl,\r\nGod has designed for you and me a closer union than even this. You say\r\nI have comforted you, that I have made life happier for you. I have\r\ncome to-night to tell you that I love you, and that I want you to be\r\nmy wife.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl recoiled from the touch of his hand, uttering a low cry of\r\nsurprise, of question.\r\n\r\nHe went on: \"Yes, I have grown to care for you beyond any other human\r\nbeing. You are my staff, my stay. God sent you to my spiritual\r\nhealing. I should have gone mad but for you.\" He bent upon her a look\r\nof passion and command. \"You must not think of going away. You belong\r\nto me.\" Her face warned him that his appeal was being misinterpreted,\r\nand he added, quickly: \"I know this comes to you abruptly, and yet you\r\nmust have felt my love, you must have read my heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not in that way,\" she answered, in a low voice. \"I thought you--I\r\nalways understood--\" The memory of his professed suffering, his\r\noft-expressed adoration for the dead Adele, checked her, filled her\r\nwith a storm of doubt, and she could not finish her accusation.\r\n\r\nHe caught up the thread she dropped. \"I _did_ love Adele, I love her\r\nstill--a holy, mysterious love--a love you cannot understand; my\r\nfeeling for you is different, but no less high. It is the cry of a\r\nlonely, desolate man. Come to me, Viola; do not question; follow your\r\nheart's leadings, as I do.\" The light of her accusing young eyes\r\npierced the armor of his defence, and he fell upon his knees before\r\nher. \"I can't explain it, but it is true, Viola. I have not deceived\r\nyou. I loved her--I love her still. She is vital in my life. I was\r\nsincere in all I said; but you are flesh and she is spirit. Don't you\r\nsee? You can comfort me--assist me, work with me as she cannot.\"\r\n\r\nAs he poured out his passionate plea, a sense of injury, of\r\ndisillusionment, overran the girl. She revolted from the touch of his\r\nhead against her knee. \"You must not talk to me that way--you belong\r\nto her.\" She pushed him away. \"Get up. Go away from me. I hate you\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\nThere was something so final, so convicting in her gesture of\r\nrepulsion that the man's head dropped. He covered his face and uttered\r\na groaning cry, and so lay silently sobbing, while she looked down at\r\nhim--woman-grown in that instant. His passion moved her to pity, not\r\nto love, and she put him aside gently and left the room without\r\nfurther word. Her master, her highest earthly guide, had fallen from\r\nhis lofty place and lay grovelling at her feet. This conception, vague\r\nbut massive, oppressed her heart, and lay upon her brain like a leaden\r\ncap.\r\n\r\nAt the moment she, too, despaired of life and knew not where to turn\r\nfor aid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE MODERNISTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bacteriologic Department of the Corlear Medical School stood at\r\nthis time on one of the cross-streets of the old East Side, not far\r\nfrom Corlear Park. It was a large, old-fashioned brick building, worn\r\nof threshold, and as ugly in line as a livery barn. Its entrance was\r\nmerely a gap in the wall, its windows rectangular openings to let in\r\nthe light. Not one touch of color or grace, not one dignified line\r\ncould be detected throughout its whole exterior. It was constructed\r\nfor use, not ornament.\r\n\r\nInteriorly it was quite as utilitarian. Its halls, bare and cheerless,\r\nechoed to the tread and were repellent as those of a barracks. The\r\nvisitor felt chilled, disappointed, as if he had been met by the\r\ninsolent servant of an indifferent hostess. It seemed the home of the\r\nmathematical, the mechanical, the material; but this was a mistake. It\r\nwas a house of dreams. The right knock at one of those ugly doors\r\nwould permit one to step into the presence of the most cheery, the\r\nmost learned, the most imaginative of individuals--the man of germs,\r\npoet, dreamer, and experimentalist, absorbed in the pursuit of the\r\nunattainable, concerned with the ultimate structure of organic life,\r\nbaffled, yet toiling on for love of his work, while the sick of the\r\nworld believe in him as an angel of altruism.\r\n\r\nThe far-away rivers of the world have all been traversed and mapped,\r\nbut the streams of blood in the arteries of man are filled with the\r\nunknown. The habits of the Esquimaux, the customs of the dwarfs of\r\nCentral Africa, the ways of the baboons of Sumatra are minutely set to\r\nbook, but the wars of the phagocytes remain indeterminate,\r\nunexplained. With microscope to his eye the bacteriologist is now\r\nexamining the constituent parts of the blood, isolating, breeding, and\r\nminutely studying the germs of fevers, the growths of tumors, and\r\nother elemental forms of human parasites, in order to discover their\r\nantagonisms, their likings; for in these jungles of the flesh the war\r\nof races proceeds quite as in the Amazonian forests--the white cells\r\nagainst the red, devouring, destroying.\r\n\r\nThe men behind these bald, bleak doors are tireless workers as well as\r\nseers and sages. They toil (at ridiculously low salaries) in the\r\navowed hope of eradicating diseases. They do not pause in dismay of\r\nthe insoluble. They--or such as they--discovered the cure for\r\nsmall-pox, for hydrophobia, diphtheria, and for yellow-fever. They and\r\ntheir like brought chloroform to the woman in travail, and ether to\r\nthe wounded soldier. They have enormously reduced the number of those\r\nwho die on the battle-field by their antiseptic dressings, and by one\r\ndiscovery after another have made infantile diseases less destructive.\r\nThey already control yellow-fever and are about to eradicate\r\ntyphoid--yet they say \"our work is but begun.\"\r\n\r\nHere one comes upon their dreams. Calm and contained as their words\r\nare, their hearts are aflame with passion for the undiscovered. They\r\nare akin to those who seek the theoretic poles of the earth, undaunted\r\nby endless defeats. With quickening breath they watch the electrons\r\nflame and fall, seeing the ultimate constitution of matter almost\r\nwithin their grasp, and yet they do not permit their dreams to blind\r\nor weaken them in their wearisome, hopeless quest.\r\n\r\nThey have their heroism for humanity, too. They meet death face to\r\nface, as they pry close into the cause of decay, the secret of morbid\r\ngrowth. There is more danger in certain germs than in lions.\r\nBlood-poisoning is to the surgeon a more constant menace than hunger\r\nto an Arctic explorer. These students never know what destroyer they\r\nmay unwittingly unloose. Cross-section of abnormal tissue is more\r\nentrancing than a rose-leaf, a cluster of bacilli more beautiful than\r\na snowflake. They have gone past all creeds, these calm young men, but\r\nthey bow before the unspeakable majesty of the unknown. To them the\r\nHebrew Scriptures are but the tales of minstrels in the childhood of\r\nthe race, Mohammed a dreamer of baseless visions, and Christ but\r\nincarnate love in an age of war. The Creator they conceive is too\r\nprofound to admit of any attribute. He neither thinks nor feels, and\r\nthe life that pulses at the base of the first faint cell is a part of\r\nthe same power that binds the stars to their circling suns.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding their daily contact with the most appalling cases of\r\ndisease and death, they come and go briskly with jocular greetings on\r\nthe stair-ways. They return to their homes each night to read, to\r\nsmoke their pipes, deporting themselves like commonplace fathers and\r\nbrothers and husbands. They even make love like other men; but,\r\nnevertheless, they may be overtaken in muse like alchemists, subject\r\nto fear and hope like children. To the business-man their ways are\r\nways of silence and sorcery. Their deep-hid convictions are at\r\nvariance with all theories of Christian redemption, and the realities\r\nof their realm more startling than any romance of war or peace. To\r\nthem matter is as insoluble as the transforming forces which emanate\r\nfrom it. They play with nerves, laying bare the beating heart of life,\r\nforever finding, yet forever failing.\r\n\r\nTo this big, bare building, to one of these barren rooms, Morton\r\nServiss returned after eight weeks study of the sands and the stars\r\nand the cave-dwellings of vanished men. From the infinitely lonely and\r\nhuge and beautiful he cloistered himself to pore upon the habits of\r\nthe infinitely small, to listen to the swarming, diminished tumult of\r\nthe protozoa. He came back, as usual, brown, alert, and\r\nkeen-eyed--eager for work, confident of some new victory, for he was\r\nan investigator of weight and standing among the younger men of\r\nscience. On the street he was indistinguishable from other debonair\r\nyoung men of good social position; in his laboratory he was a master,\r\nabsorbed, reticent, and precise of plan.\r\n\r\nHis chief, a little, gray, bent, brusque German, greeted him with\r\nabsent-minded smile, remarked briefly upon his good health, and then\r\nthey set to work. In thirty seconds he had forgotten the desert, the\r\nface of Viola, all his energies concentrated on the segment of cancer\r\nbeneath his eye. A newly developed germ, a thousandth part the stature\r\nof a gnat's toe, shut out the valley of the Colorow. All day he moved\r\namong a wilderness of tubes, jars, and copper ovens, peering,\r\nobserving--and in a sense happy.\r\n\r\nBut at night, when alone with his pipe in his study, the lavender\r\nsands, the violet peaks, the vivid saffron skies returned with power.\r\nViola, too, came back to bewitch him from his reading, to make his\r\nmicroscopic world of shadowy substance and the smell of his laboratory\r\na hateful thing.\r\n\r\nHe heard nothing further of her. Britt wrote once or twice, but did\r\nnot allude to either Clarke or the Lamberts, and Serviss did not care\r\nto ask particularly about them. It was better for him not to be\r\nconcerned further with the girl's singular history. He hated the\r\nirregular, the pretentious. His own life, so clear, so well regulated,\r\nmade her daily performances the more monstrous. The whole had become\r\nso foolish in retrospect that he refrained from speaking of it, even\r\nto his sister.\r\n\r\nIt was not quite true that he saw little of New York, for his sister,\r\nMrs. Rice--a widow with two children--who kept his house, or, rather,\r\nhis double flat, was a social soul, and not merely went about freely,\r\nbut entertained regularly. They lived handsomely, and the world in\r\nwhich they moved was crowded with duties as well as with sane\r\npleasures. They entertained at their table artists from Paris, savans\r\nfrom Berlin, and literary lesser lights from London, and they enjoyed\r\nall this, envying the richer and more ostentatious families of the\r\ncity as little as they despised the poor of Hester Street. The one\r\nquality which they insisted upon in their guests was intellectual\r\ncleverness. Perhaps they were a little severe on bores.\r\n\r\nTheir ways were quite as remote from the so-called captains of\r\nindustry as from the farmers of Jersey, and the roar of Broad Street\r\nwas so far away it reached them but as the hum of hornets outside\r\ntheir window-pane. To the explorer of Tibet this life was narrow. To\r\nthe gay dinner-parties of upper Fifth Avenue it would have seemed\r\ndull. To the wrecker of railroads on Wall Street it was indubitably\r\npetty. To the merchant it was unprofitable, and yet they were quite\r\ncontent with it, and looked out upon the bustling throngs of fashion\r\nand the hustling world of business with equal word of good-natured\r\ncontempt.\r\n\r\n\"We can't all be biologists,\" Serviss was accustomed to say, \"and I\r\nsuppose somebody must continue to steal and murder.\"\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: \"VIOLA, TOO, CAME BACK TO BEWITCH HIM FROM HIS\r\n   READING\"]\r\n\r\nThey came of good stock, these Servisses, and knew it and felt it.\r\nBreeding was indicated in their well-set heads, in their shapely\r\nhands, and especially in their handsome noses. \"We are inclined to be\r\nstubby, that's true, but we have the noses of aristocrats--they go\r\nback to the Aryans of the Danube,\" said Mrs. Rice to a friend. \"Morton\r\ncannot consider a girl of questionable pedigree, no matter how rich or\r\ncharming she may be. We believe in stock--not in family, but _strain_;\r\na family is an accident, a strain is a formation. The Mortons and the\r\nServisses are _strains_. Their union in my brother will yet make\r\nitself felt.\" Her confidence in his powers was absolute. \"He is one of\r\nthe greatest young men of his day. Time will show,\" she added, as if\r\nto clinch her argument.\r\n\r\nThe circle of their acquaintance included, first of all--and of\r\ncourse--the scientific group, then in successive widening waves the\r\ngeneral literary and educational fraternities, the artistic and\r\nmusical sets, and finally they kept in touch with the old New York\r\nfamilies, their own school-mates and friends and those related. All\r\nthe details and duties of the social side of his life Morton turned\r\nover to Kate, and such was her tact, and her skill and charm as\r\nhostess, that her rooms of a Tuesday afternoon were filled with a\r\ncompany of men and women as cheerful and as informal as they were\r\nclever and distinguished. Among these groups Serviss moved as detached\r\nof all responsibility as any of his guests, finding in this contact\r\nwith bright minds one of the greatest pleasures of his life.\r\n\r\nThese various circles moved afar from isms. They prided themselves on\r\ntheir balance, their commonsense, their fund of comparative ideas.\r\nTrue, some of the women had embraced Christian Science more or less\r\nopenly, but they did not esteem it necessary to proselyte. Political\r\ncreeds were but jocularly discussed. To advocate any special belief\r\nwas to prick one's self down a bore, although some of those in the\r\nstrictly university circles did at times become troublesomely learned\r\nin conversation. However, this was esteemed \"old fogy-ism\" by the\r\nyounger men like Serviss, who alluded to \"the days of the professional\r\nmonologue\" with smiling contempt. Conversation with them was a means\r\nof diversion, not of enlightenment as to any special subject.\r\n\r\nInto these circles a thorough-going spiritualist never penetrated. To\r\ntell the truth, these modernists did not permit the hereafter to awe\r\nor affright them. Some of them went to church, but they did so calmly,\r\npatiently, as to a decorous function, and some may at times have\r\nprayed, through the medium of printed supplication, but, generally\r\nspeaking, they had reached a sort of philosophic indifference as to\r\nthe one-time burning question of heaven or hell. So far from\r\nacquiescing in the dictum that morality was but filthy rags, they\r\nesteemed good deeds and clean thoughts higher than any religion\r\nwhatsoever.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rice expressed the convictions of many of her associates by\r\nsaying, humorously: \"No, I don't want to be saved. I'm not lost. I\r\ndon't know as I care for immortality. Forever is a long time--I might\r\nget bored; anyhow, the future must take care of itself.\"\r\n\r\nIn all the drawing-rooms of his friends, Morton Serviss was a most\r\nwelcome guest. His frank, boyish ways, his careless dress, his freedom\r\nfrom cant, his essential good-fellowship deceived the most of his\r\nacquaintances into thinking him a mere dabbler in science, a man of\r\nwealth amusing himself; but Weissmann, who was qualified to know,\r\nsaid: \"He has persistency, concentration, a keen mind, a clear eye,\r\nand a _voonderful_ physique.\"\r\n\r\nHe belonged, moreover, to the men of imagination, not to those who\r\nwrite books or poems, but to those who tunnel mountains, build vast\r\nbridges, invent new motors, and play with electrical currents as if\r\nthey were ribbons. The novelist basing himself on what he knows of\r\nhuman nature projects himself into the unknown, just as the scientist\r\nwho stands on the discoveries of those before him feels out into the\r\ndarkness for new stars, new forces. And yet as Clarke and his party\r\nindignantly declared, \"both novelist and scientist ignore the question\r\nmost vital to us all--the question of the soul's survival after\r\ndeath\"--ignore it till some loved one dies, then they, too, agonize in\r\nsecret over the mystery for a space, only to rise and go back to their\r\nwork, concealing the conviction which their hour of anguish brought to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was not chance, but deep design, which had brought this\r\nvigorous young investigator face to face with a mystery crying out for\r\nsolution--certainly it was not without craft that the unseen powers\r\nhad baited their hook with the almost irresistible allurement of a\r\nyoung and ardent girl. If there is logic in the shadow, fate was on\r\nViola's side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nNEWS OF VIOLA\r\n\r\n\r\nOne morning in late March, while Serviss was still at his morning's\r\nmail, Dr. Britt's card came in, bringing with it instant, vivid\r\nrecollection of Colorow. The beauty of his days there had by no means\r\nfaded from his mind, although he had succeeded in putting his romance\r\nin the background of his working brain, and had given up all thought\r\nof ever seeing Viola again.\r\n\r\nHe greeted Britt most cordially. \"So you turned up at last! How is the\r\nlung? Isn't this a raw time of the year for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes; but my father died a few days ago, and I had to come on,\r\nand being near I ran in to see how you and the 'bugs' were getting\r\non.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we're thriving. Their ways are quite absorbing. How is your own\r\n'farm'?\"\r\n\r\n\"All in ruins. The fact is I've neglected the poor little brutes. I\r\nhad no time for germs after I went off into the study of 'spooks.'\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't tell me you've turned investigator of spirits! What have\r\nyou discovered?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a thing. It's the most elusive problem I ever tackled. You\r\nremember the Lamberts?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well. I was about to ask about them.\"\r\n\r\n\"They're here now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here! In New York?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. They went to Boston last fall--Boston is a hot-bed of spookism,\r\nas you may know. They spent the winter there among the brethren, and\r\nhave come on here for a change.\"\r\n\r\n\"They'll get it. What is--the girl doing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Spooking mainly. That's all her 'guides' will allow her to do. Clarke\r\nstill dominates the household by the aid of the ghostly granddaddy--a\r\ngrim old chap that. They hold regular 'séances' now.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean it!\" Serviss grew graver yet of countenance. \"I had\r\nhoped they would spare her that humiliation. I haven't seen her name\r\nin the papers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they don't go quite so far as that. The circles are 'very\r\nselect.' Only the priests of the faith and their friends are\r\ninvited--no admission fee--you understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad of that. It would be too bad to put that child forward in\r\nthe double rôle of fakir and money-breeder; but, tell me, have you any\r\nfresh light on the subject of her mediumship?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes. I've changed my point of view slightly. I'm inclined to\r\nthink there is pretty generally some basis for the faith. The\r\nliterature of the subject is immense, and some of it is as well\r\nauthenticated as any physical treatise. I'm convinced that Miss\r\nLambert has no intent to deceive--she has no possible motive to do\r\nso--but Clarke has, and yet I cannot connect him directly with the\r\nphenomena.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is her health?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, apparently. She is quite as blooming as when you saw her,\r\nand is immensely more mature mentally.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is she resigned to her life?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes she is and sometimes not. She is very sensitive to\r\ninfluences, and at times when Clarke is near she grows almost as\r\nenthusiastic as he--at other times she bitterly complains. I tried to\r\nfree her from Clarke, but she wouldn't give me the authority\r\nnecessary.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\r\n\r\nThere was something both sad and mocking in Britt's face as he\r\nanswered: \"I offered to marry her--wasn't that generous of me? She\r\nspurned my humble offer, intimating that there was small choice\r\nbetween me and Clarke and the spooks. No, I'll be honest, she was very\r\nnice and kind about it, and added that perhaps Mr. Clarke was\r\nright--her duty in the world was to 'convince people of the reality of\r\nthe forces,' or something like that. 'I shall never marry,' she added,\r\nto soften the blow, and really she does seem a person set apart.\"\r\n\r\nServiss looked down at his book. \"I suppose she imagines herself\r\nstricken with a mortal illness. I confess I sometimes think of her in\r\nthat way. I can't understand why her parents--\" He checked himself.\r\n\"Where are they stopping?\"\r\n\r\n\"They're housed over near the Riverside Drive with a wild enthusiast\r\nwho has oodles and wads of money--old Simeon Pratt.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've heard of Simeon--Uncle Simeon the reporters call him on 'the\r\nStreet.' I remember now about his spiritualism. He had some remarkable\r\nexperiences after his wife's death--drowned, wasn't she?\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't afford to be indefinite about Simeon's sorrows, doctor, for\r\nthey made him what he is. I find these believers all start in about\r\nthe same way. Simeon's wife and two daughters were lost in the English\r\nChannel. Simeon became a believer the following Monday--or maybe it\r\nwas Tuesday.\"\r\n\r\n\"I recall the story of his life now. It was all very tragic. I wonder\r\nhe didn't become a maniac.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some people think he did,\" answered Britt, dryly.\r\n\r\n\"So they're with Simeon. He lives gorgeously, I'm told.\"\r\n\r\n\"About like a lone American guest in a twenty-franc-per-day hotel in\r\nParis. Why, yes, they're very comfortable there--all but the girl.\r\nShe's discontented and unhappy, if I'm any judge, and is besieged day\r\nand night by the mourning faithful, not to speak of certain amorous\r\nmales.\"\r\n\r\nThis hurt, and Serviss shifted ground. \"Does she keep up her music?\"\r\n\r\nAgain Britt smiled, but not humorously. \"She plays the harp--in the\r\ndark.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean--\"\r\n\r\n\"She's taken on a lot more of the regulation tricks--materializing\r\nflowers, slate-writing, music without hands, etc.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean it! I can hardly associate such doings with her,\"\r\nsorrow and indignation mingled in his voice.\r\n\r\n\"I assure you I was there last night at a 'circle,' and these things\r\ntook place with Clarke as ring-master. There wasn't a particle of\r\noriginality--it was the same old mill, and the same old grist, yet I\r\ndon't hold her responsible in any harmful degree. I can't believe she\r\ndesignedly tricks, but she's surrounded now by a gang of chattering,\r\nsoft-pated women, and men with bats in their belfry, who unite in\r\nassuring her that her God-given powers must be fostered. They've cut\r\nher off from any decent marriage--she's virtually a prisoner to their\r\nwhims. What they may induce her to do next I don't know. I'm going to\r\nhang round here for a week or two and see.\" A violent fit of coughing\r\ninterrupted him. When he recovered he looked up sidewise. \"Isn't this\r\na peach of a climate? Wouldn't you think they'd build at least one of\r\ntheir big cities where microbes couldn't fatten on genius?\"\r\n\r\n\"What led Clarke to consent to leaving the West? When I was there he\r\nbitterly opposed her going.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's very simple. He has written a book on _The Physical Proof of\r\nImmortality_, and, being anxious for a publisher, withdrew his\r\nopposition to her plan, and declared himself willing to go to\r\nBoston--at Lambert's expense.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he out of the Church?\"\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely. You should have heard his farewell sermon. It really was\r\nas dramatic a speech as I ever heard. He went on to declare that the\r\nHebrews were not the only seers, that the wells of inspiration were\r\nnot yet dry, that revelation was waiting upon every soul to-day, and\r\nthat he had been led by sorrow to listen at the key-hole, and so on. I\r\ntrembled for the girl's secret, but he had himself in hand, and did\r\nnot betray her. No one out there knows for certain what her\r\nabnormalities are.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about Lambert? Why didn't he take a hand?\"\r\n\r\n\"He seemed bewildered by it all, and overawed by Clarke and the girl's\r\n'controls.' 'It's all above timber-line for me,' he said, but he\r\ndidn't like their coming away a little bit. He was angry with Clarke\r\nfor breaking up his home, and if the girl had been his own I think he\r\nwould have stopped the business long ago. Then there was a young\r\nfellow, Clinton Ward, who was working for Lambert, a fine young\r\nfellow--\"\r\n\r\n\"I remember him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it seems that his father is a partner in a publishing firm in\r\nBoston, and Clarke tried to make use of him to get his book published,\r\nand I believe his firm is to take it. Meanwhile the young fellow is in\r\nlove with Viola, and willing to marry her and take chances, but his\r\nfamily is very properly aghast. Viola, knowing this--or for some other\r\nreason--refuses him. And there you are! The girl seems cursed on all\r\nsides, and, worst of all, has to endure Clarke and his ravings twelve\r\nhours of every mortal day.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is her relation to Clarke?\" asked Serviss, hesitatingly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, I don't know. Sometimes I think he controls her by some\r\ninfernal hypnotic power; and then again, from some phrase of her own,\r\nI think she considers her mind diseased, and marriage with any one\r\nelse impossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see how the mother can stand by and see her daughter's life\r\nburned away.\"\r\n\r\n\"She, in her turn, seems enslaved to the dead. She has often told me\r\nthat her father's spirit is leading her every movement.\"\r\n\r\n\"That particular ghost is Clarke--don't you think?\"\r\n\r\nBritt's eyes narrowed. \"I don't know. I have never been able to\r\nconnect him directly with a single one of these manifestations, and\r\nyet he must be at the bottom of part of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It all comes back, then, to the girl herself.\"\r\n\r\nBritt rose uneasily. \"I repeat I am completely at sea. I have studied\r\nevery line of old Randall's notes till I'm 'dopy' myself. Everything\r\nhas conspired to make the girl hysterical--to fasten some accursed\r\nmental weakness upon her. If I could have stopped it two years ago she\r\nmight have outgrown it. Every year now makes it less easy for her to\r\nshake it off--whatever it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Atrocious!\" exclaimed Serviss. \"Has no one authority to act?\"\r\n\r\nBritt shrugged his shoulders. \"What would you do when both\r\nparents--the living and the dead--consent? Only a husband could\r\nintervene, and Clarke seems to be about to claim that place. No, I see\r\nno hope for the girl. She may be right, after all, in joining Clarke.\"\r\n\r\nServiss rose to release the emotional tension under which he had kept\r\nhis limbs. \"You don't know their present plans?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, only that Clarke is going to publish soon.\" He looked round the\r\nroom. \"What a development since my time! Bacteriology and\r\nauto-transportation are neck and neck in their amazing expansion.\"\r\n\r\nThereupon they dropped all reference to the Lamberts and their trials,\r\nand turned their minds upon phagocytes and other ravening mites whose\r\nlikes and dislikes, minute as they are, work more devastation than\r\ncannon.\r\n\r\nServiss's work was over for that day; after Britt went away he sat\r\nidly at his desk, his mind busy with the revolting pictures called up\r\nby what he had heard of Viola. \"They are destroying a beautiful soul,\"\r\nhe exclaimed, bitterly, as he recalled the charm of her face and voice\r\non that ride to the mine. \"They are forcing a charming girl into an\r\nabominable life, they are warping her moral fibre into ugliness and\r\ndeath--and Clarke is the fanatic devil of the scheme.\"\r\n\r\nThe desire to see her, to talk with her, to measure the change in her\r\ngrew very strong--so strong that he meditated a call, but the thought\r\nof Clarke cut the resolution off before it was fully formed.\r\n\"Probably Britt is right--Clarke's rotten soul has fatally infected\r\nhers.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Weissmann came in Serviss turned to him and said: \"Doctor, I want\r\nto ask you a very unusual question.\"\r\n\r\n\"Proceed,\" replied the old man, who spoke with a little touch of the\r\nGerman now and then.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think of the claims of spiritualism?\"\r\n\r\nWeissmann did not smile as Serviss had expected. He became grave. \"I\r\nam not qualified to judge. Speaking generally, I would say there are\r\nmany phases to be considered. There are some millions of people who\r\nbelieve in it--which would argue some small basis of truth to start\r\nwith. On the other hand, the extraordinary credulity of these people\r\nis to be taken into account.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean they are those bereaved and anxious to believe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely. Again, speaking generally, I find few things impossible in\r\nthis world of mystery. To take an old metaphor, I would not be\r\nsurprised to find a grain of wheat in all this bushel of chaff. Every\r\ngenuine phenomenon in the world stands related to every other\r\nphenomenon, and I believe that the truth or falsity of the\r\nspiritualistic hypothesis can be determined in accordance with\r\nphysical science. If I were young and strong like you I would devote\r\nmyself to the study of this delusion. It should be studied by one like\r\nyourself--to whom death is no near presence; as for me, I have two\r\nsons and one wife dead; my judgment would be vitiated therewith. You\r\nhave no dead; you would make an admirable student of these\r\nspirit-voices and signs.\"\r\n\r\nServiss, though a little awed by the old man's unexpectedly solemn\r\nmanner, ventured further. \"Have you ever witnessed any of these\r\nunaccountable doings which Crookes and Zöllner instance?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have had them in my own chamber.\" The old man's eyes twinkled.\r\n\"Once, as I was dozing on my bed, one morning early, a faint cloud,\r\nlike a puff of smoke, began to form above my head. It became\r\npendulous, reaching towards me, and out of it a hand developed and\r\nextended. I said: 'It is an hallucination--very curious! I will touch\r\nit and it will vanish.' I reached--I grasped the hand--_it was warm\r\nand solid!_ I leaped from my bed with a yell.\" He chuckled at his\r\nkeenly remembered discomfiture.\r\n\r\n\"How do you account for it? It was an illusion, of course. You thought\r\nthe illusion only ocular--it extended to the sense of touch.\"\r\n\r\nWeissmann's eyes gleamed speculatively. \"We will let it go so. The\r\nworld of sense and the world of spirit curiously intermingle--as we\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\n\"But these manifestations, so far as I have any knowledge, are so\r\nfoolish and childish--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, so many foolish and childish persons have gone to the other\r\nworld. Death is not the beginning of wisdom. I am an old man, Serviss,\r\nand already many of my loved ones are dead. I should like to believe\r\nthey are still sentient, and maybe they are. I am German. The blood of\r\nKant is in my veins.\" He seemed to be speaking partly to himself. \"I\r\ndo not dogmatize so gladly as I once did. As I do not know the essence\r\nof matter, it would be folly for me to assume to fathom the depth of\r\nspirit. The essential hopelessness of science is coming to render me\r\nhumble. Spiritualism certainly is a comfortable belief. I would gladly\r\nembrace it if I could. I suspend judgment. This desire for another\r\nlife may be only a survival of a more unreasoning time, something we\r\nwill outgrow.\"\r\n\r\nServiss was profoundly surprised by his chief's attitude. He had\r\nexpected a large, calm, and rather contemptuous reply to his question.\r\nIn place of decision he encountered a doubt, a hesitancy, which\r\nbetrayed weakness. Rudolph Weissmann, great as he was, belonged to the\r\ninnumerable throng of the bereaved whose judgments are clouded by\r\npassion. He, too, was growing old, his all-embracing mind had yielded\r\nto an hallucination.\r\n\r\nThe young man's respect for his chief did not diminish, but a feeling\r\nof sadness swept over him as he realized that another renowned and\r\nfearless investigator was nearing the end of his great usefulness, and\r\nthat upon the clear blue steel of his intelligence the rust of age had\r\nbegun to fall. Truly the power of his early training, his worship of\r\nKant and his school was still vital.\r\n\r\nThen he pondered his words. \"If I were a young man like you I would\r\ninvestigate this thing,\" and recalled that no young man of science had\r\never devoted himself to it. \"They all came to it late in life, after\r\nbereavement.\"\r\n\r\nThe bereaved! The whole stupendous delusion seemed to rest upon the\r\novermastering desire of the bereaved for their beloved. The great and\r\ngood men and women among the believers (he was willing to admit there\r\nwere such) came to investigation weakened by sorrow, made illogical by\r\nloss. They put their sane judgment, their strength, their calm\r\npatience aside and grasped eagerly at the lying comfort extended to\r\nthem. They were not merely deceived, they developed fraud by their\r\nblindness, by their hunger for consolation, and by their crass\r\ncredulity. He was still young enough to have inexorable theories--to\r\nbe of single-hearted loyalty to his creed. To him as a monist, the\r\nsoul (as an entity apart from the body) did not exist. Consciousness\r\nwas a physical disturbance of the higher nerve centres, and thought a\r\nsecretion of the brain. He acknowledged no line of demarcation between\r\nthe crystal and the monera--and no chasm (of course) between man and\r\nthe animals. The universe was a unit--and all its forms and forces\r\ndifferentiations of one substance and that substance too mysterious to\r\nbe analyzed or named. In such a philosophy as this there could be no\r\nroom for any hypothesis which even so much as squinted towards\r\ndualism, or that permitted a conception so childish as the persistence\r\nof the individuality after death.\r\n\r\nHowever, he did not carry his implacable principles into the homes of\r\nhis friends, and seldom permitted them to interfere with his enjoyment\r\nof wines or good dinners, the theatre or the drawing-room. This fact,\r\nfrom a cynical point of view, proved his faith to have been as truly\r\nof his laboratory as that of a bishop, with Spencer and Darwin and\r\nKoch and Haeckel as the founders of its articles.\r\n\r\nHe went home that night with the words of both Weissmann and Britt\r\nintermingling in his mind, strongly tempted to tell Viola's story to\r\nhis sister, and so enlist her sympathy for the poor girl.\r\n\r\nBut it happened that an engagement to dine filled Kate's mind, and he\r\nhad no time to open the subject till they were on the way, and by that\r\ntime he had concluded not to involve her in his perplexity.\r\n\r\nBy a curious coincidence one of the guests at the dinner brought a\r\nhush of expectancy over the entire company by relating a series of\r\nexperiences he had been privileged to share with a \"psychic\" some\r\nyears before. He told of his mystification with a laugh in his eyes\r\nand with racy vigor of tongue, but Serviss, newly alive to the topic,\r\ncould not but marvel at the intensity of interest manifested by every\r\nsoul present. \"Disguise it as we may,\" said the narrator, \"this\r\nquestion of the life beyond the grave is chief of all our problems. It\r\nis the sovereign mystery, after all.\"\r\n\r\nAt this the hostess spoke: \"I wish _we_ could see some of these\r\nthings. You make us shudder deliciously. Can't you sometime bring\r\nthis remarkable young woman--they're always women, aren't they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no,\" laughingly replied the young fellow. \"One of the most amusing\r\n'stunts' I ever saw was that of a man in Washington, who made a banjo\r\nplay behind a curtain while holding both your hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why _do_ the spirits do such foolish things? I should think they'd be\r\nashamed to act so 'frivolous like.'\"\r\n\r\n\"They always talk like Indians, don't they? It's a pity. Why aren't\r\nthey dignified and sincere?\"\r\n\r\nThe young story-teller went on. \"That's just it. The mediums are so\r\nnonchalant while causing these marvels that they fail to convince.\r\nWhy, when I was holding a slate in order that they might write upon\r\nit, I minded the scratching no more than a clock a-ticking, they had\r\nmade me that careless of their hocus-pocus. A voice in my ear can't\r\nmake me start, and nothing, absolutely nothing, can now 'rouse my fell\r\nof hair.' You put a potato in the ashes of the hearth and it will\r\nultimately pop into something to eat. You put a medium in a dark place\r\nand she will set your soul's nerves a-tingle.\"\r\n\r\nUnder all this banter Serviss perceived the pulse of an interest which\r\nlaid hold on the most secret hopes and fears of the youngest and shook\r\nthe eldest with an elemental dread and longing. It was as if the\r\nflood-gates of a sea of doubt and wonder had been turned in upon a\r\ndozen minds hitherto as well kept as lawns. Questions popped like\r\ncorks and answers were as vivacious as the gurgle of wine, but the\r\ntopic remained indeterminate--the argument inconclusive.\r\n\r\nOn their way home, Serviss said to his sister: \"Did you notice how\r\nprofound the silence became when Ralph started that discussion of the\r\noccult?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is always so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it, really? I hadn't noticed it particularly.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's because people are afraid to talk such things before you\r\nscientists. Why, every woman there has been to a palmist or\r\nmind-reader or something.\"\r\n\r\n\"You astonish me. Have you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course! I go every little while just for fun. We all pretend that\r\nwe don't believe in it, but we do. I'm scared blue every time I go to\r\na new one--they're all such creepy creatures. The last one I went to\r\nwas positively weird.\"\r\n\r\nServiss was severe. \"Kate, I am ashamed of you. To think that you, a\r\nwoman of penetration, associating with people of rare intelligence\r\nlike myself--\"\r\n\r\n\"But why don't you people of rare intelligence look into these things?\r\nWhy do you leave us poor untrained emotional creatures to suffer\r\nbefoolment when you could so easily instruct us and shield us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because, while we could easily prove you befooled, you would still\r\nfollow after your saw-dust idols. We prefer to save you from your\r\n_bodily_ infirmities and contagions, and so react on your minds.\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed. \"That's very clever of you, and very decent. Stay with\r\nyour germs, rob us of our diseases, but leave us, oh, leave us our\r\ndelicious _thrills_!\" She became grave. \"The fact is, Morton, we all\r\nhave moments when we feel the presence of the dead. I do. Father and\r\nmother never seem away off in our Graceland vault; sometimes they seem\r\nto be in the room with me. It's all a fancy, you'll say, and very\r\nfoolish, but I believe mother actually comes to help me with Georgie\r\nwhen he is ill. Sometimes in the deep of the night I thrill as if she\r\ntouched me.\"\r\n\r\nHe was not unsympathetic as he said: \"You never hinted at this\r\nbefore.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was afraid to do so. If mother exists somewhere, and in some\r\netherealized form, why can't she come back? Why couldn't her mind act\r\non mine and produce the sensation of her presence?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it could. Only there is no proof of its ever happening.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now see here, Morton, so long as we are on this subject at last, I\r\nwant to ask you, do you believe mother is gone--absolutely blotted out\r\nof existence?\" She waited in tense silence, and as they passed a\r\nstreet-lamp, and the light fell on his face, he seemed to have grown\r\nsuddenly pale. \"Do you believe Darwin and Spencer and Victor Hugo have\r\ngone to nothingness?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, at the bottom of my heart I can't think that, and yet\r\ntheoretically I cannot conceive of the existence of any soul apart\r\nfrom the body. Think of it! If mother lives, so do all the billions of\r\ncannibals, negroes, Bushmen--you can't draw a line and say 'here\r\nbegins the immortal souls.'\"\r\n\r\n\"That isn't the question. I do not believe that father and mother and\r\nHayward have vanished into a handful of dust, I cling to a belief in\r\ntheir living selves, not because the bishop and the prayer-books say\r\nso, but just because my own mind says so. I won't surrender them,\r\nthat's all.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet a faith springing from such a desire is not well based. I\r\nwant to tell you about some people I met last summer. They will\r\ninterest you.\" Thereupon he pictured his first meeting with Viola. He\r\ndescribed the mother and Clarke. He told of his interview with Britt\r\nand of Randall's revelations concerning Viola's life. \"And now they\r\nhave convinced the girl that she should extend her sphere of influence\r\nand bring her chicanery to bear on the metropolis.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know it is chicanery?\"\r\n\r\n\"Britt said--\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care what Britt said. You found the mother sweet, and you\r\nadmit the girl is charming. I'll trust your instinct in such matters,\r\nMort; you've never been one to run after frumps and minxes. She had\r\ngood eyes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Beautiful eyes, steady, blue-gray, wistful. She quite enchanted me at\r\nfirst--\"\r\n\r\n\"And you're sentimental over her still?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't say that I was sentimental over her at any time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care what you said. I can tell by your voice that she is a\r\nlost, sweet dream. What do you want me to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you do. You want me to see her and find out what she's doing\r\nhere. It is Kate to the rescue! I will go to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are too precipitate! You might wait and get my mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have your mind already, and I believe in doing things vigorously.\r\nBesides, you've roused my curiosity. After all these years of waiting\r\nto see you get interested in something besides your 'bugs'!--I'm\r\ndelighted to know you're human, and that there is one woman in the\r\nworld who can make you moan. You are hit--don't deny it! You've been\r\nbrooding on that girl all this time. I've known you were hit, but I\r\nthought I would wait till you cared to speak. I'm crazy to see her. I\r\nshall act at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's too much to ask of you, but I hope you will consider me to the\r\nextent--\"\r\n\r\n\"If your theory is correct that girl ought to be snatched away before\r\nthe mob of occultists, freaks, and flatterers of this city utterly\r\nspoil her. Anyhow, I'm going to look into her case on my own account.\"\r\nAnd in this determination she snuggled into the corner of the carriage\r\nand became silent.\r\n\r\nServiss found that sharing his experience with his sister had\r\nenormously increased the weight and importance of his doubt. Viola and\r\nher singular beleaguerment had suddenly grown to be a vital\r\nproblem--something to be immediately seized upon, and he casually\r\nadded: \"It is only fair to say that the Lamberts are above the need\r\nof taking money for any display of 'psychic force.'\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly Kate sat up. \"Suppose the girl really _has_ these powers?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is impossible!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why impossible? Do you men of science pretend to know _all_ there is\r\nto know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not; but think what such an admission involves.\"\r\n\r\n\"No matter _what_ it involves. You don't ask what the X-ray involves;\r\nyou ask, first of all, is it a fact? If the girl has these powers,\r\nthen what? You don't even know what she claims, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not in detail.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, don't condemn her till you know what you're condemning\r\nher for.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kate, you amaze me. I thought you would commend my cool judgment, my\r\nsanity, and lo and behold! as Aunt Celina says, you have become the\r\ngirl's advocate and the assailant of science.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. I merely say you scientific people should not be so\r\ninsultingly sure that people with a faith are fools.\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't say fools--we merely say misinformed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anyhow, you've interested me in this medium--\"\r\n\r\n\"For Heaven's sake, don't call her that if you're going to see her. To\r\napply such a name to that sweet child is an outrage.\"\r\n\r\nKate's voice was exultant as she cried out: \"Now I know you're in love\r\nwith her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Rice, you are a very wise woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope I shall not find you a very silly scientist,\" she replied,\r\nwith several implications of superiority in both words and tone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nBRITT COMES TO DINE\r\n\r\n\r\nHis sister's blunt words brought Morton face to face with himself. His\r\nheart had been touched, his imagination fired by Viola, hence his\r\ndiscontent, his heat of anger towards the unlovely side of her life.\r\nIt was the memory of her that had kept him half-hearted to the claims\r\nof several comely women of his circle whom Kate had advocated.\r\n\r\nAnd now his mind (which ought to have been given up entirely to\r\nbacteria) was filled with the face and fortunes of one who was either\r\nliving a lie or suffering from an abnormally developed brain. Singular\r\nand sad predicament for a man who had determined to move slowly and\r\nwith calm foresight. Furthermore, the whole world in which his love\r\nlived and moved was repellent, silly, and morbid. Since his meeting\r\nwith her he had tried to read some of the journals devoted to her\r\nfaith, and had found them incredibly inane--smudgily printed, slovenly\r\nof phrase, and filled with messages from Aristotle, Columbus, and\r\nConfucius, which would have been discouraging in a boy of twelve years\r\nold. The phraseology, the cant terms, nauseated him. The\r\nadvertisements of \"Psychics,\" \"World-famous Mediums,\" \"Palmists,\"\r\n\"Horologists,\" and only the devil himself knows what else, filled him\r\nwith disgust, added to his already poor opinion of sick humanity. Of\r\nthese Viola now formed a part--as an actress shares the envy, the\r\nbrag, the selfish, blatant struggle for success which is reflected in\r\nthe advertising columns of dramatic journals. He ran down each column\r\nof \"display ads\" of _The World of Spirit_, timorously, almost\r\nexpecting to see a notice of \"the marvellous psychic Miss Viola\r\nLambert, the mountain seeress\"--and so on.\r\n\r\nOn deeper thought he found these papers shrewdly contrived to take\r\nhuman beings at their weakest point, their most unguarded moment; they\r\nhad the boldness of the juggler who knows the blind spot in the eyes\r\nof his spectators. They occupied a field apart from all other\r\nperiodicals in the world. Science, literature, and art concerned them\r\nonly so far as they touched upon, illuminated, or strengthened faith\r\nin \"the farther shore.\" They were as special as a trade-journal--far\r\nmore so, indeed, for the _Boot and Shoe News_ prints occasional\r\nreviews of books, and some admirable stories may be found within its\r\npages side by side with notes on \"Burnishers\" and stitching-machines.\r\n\r\nThe accounts of circles, sittings, and \"séances\"--good Lord, how he\r\nhated that word!--were almost comic, and yet to think of Viola and her\r\ngracious mother concerned with these meetings, even as spectators,\r\nfilled him with angry disgust.\r\n\r\nAccording to Britt, the girl was a self-deluded fakir at the best--at\r\nthe worst, an habitual, hysterical trickster, avid for notoriety. In\r\neither case a tainted, leprous thing--a woman to be shunned by every\r\nman who valued a dignified and wholesome life. It was worse than folly\r\nto permit such a creature to break in on his work, to draw his mind\r\nfrom his reading; nevertheless she continued to do both these things.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, as he was leaving the house for his office, he\r\nstepped into the dining-room and took a seat by his sister's side.\r\n\r\n\"Kate,\" he said, and his voice was stern, \"you must not call upon Miss\r\nLambert.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not, Morton?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because it would prove a snare to you and an embarrassment to me. She\r\nis a singularly attractive girl. No one can face her and accuse her.\r\nBritt says she is much more mature than when I saw her; and by that he\r\nmeant to convey that she had grown clever, if not tricky. There is a\r\nbad streak in her, I'm afraid, for all her charm, and you would better\r\nlet her entirely alone. Upon the most charitable construction she is\r\nhysterical, and her deception probably arises, as Britt says, from a\r\ndiseased brain. In any case she is not a fit person for you to meet.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you said she has good eyes?\"\r\n\r\n\"She has. She is bewitchingly pretty, but that only makes her case the\r\nmore perplexing. Why trouble ourselves about her?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to call upon her, anyway. I'm not afraid. I am wild to see\r\na girl who can upset you so completely. You are upset; I can see\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\nMorton laughed, rather sadly. \"That's a fine, womanly reason, and may\r\nbe sufficient for you; but, if you go, understand, Kate, it is against\r\nmy wish. I do not care to know anything more about her and her\r\nproblems; she has interfered too much with my work already.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked deep into his soul, then took another tack. \"Well, then,\r\nbring on this man Britt; he's the only witness for the prosecution,\r\nisn't he? Let's have him to dinner. I want to interrogate him, as the\r\nlawyers say. I want to know what kind of a man he is before I take his\r\nword against a girl who rejected him. He may be only jaundiced.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was their family physician.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care if he was, he may be seeking revenge on the girl.\" She\r\nput her arm about his neck. \"You poor boy, that girl's troubles have\r\nupset you. I'm delighted to find you so humanly romantic--at least I\r\nwould be if she weren't so questionable. But we'll find out. I'm on\r\nher side till I know more of Britt; besides, I'm not sure that her\r\nmysterious powers are not real,\" and she sent him away less keenly\r\nconcerned. With all her impulse and zeal of friendship she was a woman\r\nof sense and power.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBritt came to dinner promptly, gratified for a chance to wear his\r\nevening dress. Kate received him gladly, but was taken aback by his\r\nlanguid elegance of manner. He really looked distinguished, and she\r\nrather hastily explained, \"Our dinner is only a family affair, Dr.\r\nBritt. We wanted to have you all to ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing could be better for me, Mrs. Rice, I assure you,\" he\r\nanswered, gallantly. \"A formal dinner would embarrass me. I've been so\r\nlong in the hills I feel like a Long Island hermit. It's a far halloo\r\nfrom Colorow to the Bowery.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's farther still from the Bowery to Colorow. That's what makes you\r\nWestern people so interesting to us of the East.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please don't make me out an honored son of the West, Mrs. Rice. I was\r\nborn in New Jersey.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were you, indeed? Oh, I'm so sorry.\"\r\n\r\n\"I regret it myself. The West would have fitted me out with better\r\nlungs.\"\r\n\r\nKate never went round when she could wade across. Therefore, no sooner\r\nwere they inhaling the savor of the soup than she began her\r\ninterrogation. \"I am very much interested in occult affairs, Dr.\r\nBritt, and my brother tells me you were the family physician of this\r\nremarkable Miss Lambert. Tell us about her.\"\r\n\r\nBritt considered a moment. \"It is true that Mrs. Lambert confided in\r\nme and permitted me to take a part in Viola's sittings; but I can\r\nhardly be called her physician. In the first place, the girl seems so\r\nperfectly well physically that medicine is unnecessary, and then, too,\r\nI never had her confidence. To be plain, I think she hated the sight\r\nof me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why was that?\"\r\n\r\nHe cast a curious sidewise glance. \"Well, I'm not pretty to look at,\r\nand then, I reckon she thought I was investigating her.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope you were.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was, but I didn't get very far.\"\r\n\r\n\"What barred you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, to begin with, pretty nearly everything took place in the\r\ndark.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's always so,\" exclaimed Kate. \"I wonder why?\"\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders. \"They all say 'light is antagonistic to the\r\npower.' You can draw your own inference.\"\r\n\r\nMorton spoke. \"I never could understand why they didn't make a special\r\neffort to avoid that criticism.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, tell us what happened,\" cried Kate. \"I'm on the edge of my\r\nchair with interest.\"\r\n\r\nBritt looked at Morton. \"That's the curious thing, isn't it? People\r\n_are_ interested. The fact is, we all secretly hope the ghost-story\r\nmay turn out to be true.\"\r\n\r\nKate laughed. \"You're perfectly right. We all pooh-pooh, but we'd be\r\nbitterly disappointed if all spirit footsteps turned out to be rats\r\nrolling nuts. But please hurry--wasn't _any_ of it true?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, I'm going to be candid--\"\r\n\r\nAt this Morton leaned forward with excess of interest, and Kate\r\nexulted. \"Good! Now it's coming. Be as candid as you can.\"\r\n\r\nBritt went on musingly. \"One night as I sat between Viola and the\r\nclosed piano, the spook, or whatever it was, ran up and down the\r\nkeys--now on the treble, now on the bass--keeping time to my\r\nwhistling.\"\r\n\r\nMorton interrupted. \"Did you _know_ that the lid was closed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I laid my hand on it while the keys were drummed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where was Miss Lambert?\"\r\n\r\n\"Apparently at my left, sleeping. It didn't really matter where she\r\nwas, for the lid was down. When the lights were turned on she was in\r\ndeep trance--apparently. That one fact of the closed piano being\r\nplayed in that way remains inexplicable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was that all?\" cried Kate, in a most disappointed way.\r\n\r\n\"Oh no. There were marvels to raise your hair, but that was all that I\r\nreally valued.\"\r\n\r\nMorton answered quickly. \"It was enough, if properly conditioned. The\r\ntheory is--I've been reading up on it--that these spook brethren of\r\nours attack their doubters in different ways. Knowing you to be a man\r\nof materialistic and rather methodical habit of mind, the powers\r\nessayed a material test. Perhaps it was a mouse?\"\r\n\r\n\"Or the cat?\" suggested Kate.\r\n\r\n\"They must have been musical and of exceptional intelligence, then,\"\r\nput in Britt, \"for they played up and down on the key-board at my\r\nrequest, and kept time to 'Yankee Doodle.'\"\r\n\r\nKate exulted. \"What do you think of that, Morton? If one is true, then\r\nall may be true.\"\r\n\r\nBritt went on. \"No. Whatever the power was, it was controlled by human\r\nintelligence. It answered to my will.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were convinced of that.\" Morton's glance was keen, keener than he\r\nknew. \"If you admit that one of these manifestations is true you open\r\nthe door for the witches.\"\r\n\r\nBritt was a little nettled. \"All this took place precisely as I relate\r\nit, in the dark, of course. But one sense, that of touch, controlled\r\nthe situation--hearing took the rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"It all shows the inadequacy of human evidence. You must not expect\r\nany one to believe that such a manifestation took place. It is like\r\nthe stories we hear of haunted houses. A friend of mine the other day\r\nwas telling me of a ghost that frequented an Australian bungalow where\r\nhe was visiting last year. Said he: 'I saw vases thrown from the\r\nmantel-piece in broad daylight. I've heard invisible feet tramping all\r\nabout my chair in a vividly lighted room.' I didn't believe him, of\r\ncourse. The fact is, we don't know our own capacity for being\r\ndeceived. We are each a microcosm--a summing-up of all our forebears,\r\nand in the obscure places of our brains are the cells of cavemen,\r\nnooks troubled by shadows and inhabited by strange noises. If you come\r\nat me in the right way you can raise a terrifying echo deep in some\r\nknot of my brain-cells; but it is only the echo of a far-away cry--it\r\nis not even the cry.\"\r\n\r\nBritt poised himself. \"Let me tell you this. I have started in to\r\nunderstand this thing. It isn't a haphazard series of deceits, of that\r\nI am at this moment convinced. The most amazing consideration to my\r\nmind is this: there is _system_ in their fool-tricks. I don't mean\r\nMiss Lambert alone, I mean in all the best-authenticated\r\nmanifestations. As you say, they know how to attack the public; the\r\nones who don't are exposed and drop out; but, generally speaking, they\r\ngo on smoothly because they know just what can be safely attempted and\r\nwhat can't. Now in Miss Lambert's case the same system appears. Her\r\nalleged phenomena fit into the scheme, her development is according to\r\nthe spiritualistic Hoyle. No originality is permitted, hence no\r\nfailure of effect.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet my brother tells me she is quite young and engaging.\"\r\n\r\n\"Altogether charming in body, and in every other thought most\r\ningenuous.\"\r\n\r\nMorton interposed mockingly. \"And you think she has built up this most\r\nelaborate system of deceit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Somebody has. I lay a good part of it to Clarke, but most of it to\r\nhysteria and the suggestion of _The Flag of Truth_ and other similar\r\nsheets.\"\r\n\r\n\"But she already had all these manifestations before Clarke's coming,\r\nand presumably before she read _The Flag of Truth_.\"\r\n\r\n\"They say so. I don't know that. Many of the tricks are noted in\r\nRandall's notes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who was Randall?\" asked Kate.\r\n\r\n\"Their family physician--my predecessor. Some of her phenomena\r\nconvinced him. He put himself on record in his notes as a convert.\r\nHowever, that was after his wife died.\"\r\n\r\n\"They all weaken when their wives die.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not all; some are not anxious to bridge the gulf,\" answered Britt,\r\nlightly. \"I'm told Clarke's communion with his dead wife is now as\r\ncool as friendship.\"\r\n\r\nKate faced him. \"It's only fair to say, Dr. Britt, that I, too, am one\r\nof the 'bereaved,' and that if I seem more hospitable to these\r\nmessages than my brother you will understand. My husband died two\r\nyears ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, Mrs. Rice, if I've seemed too harsh in my zeal to\r\nexplain--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm not one to fear the truth,\" she answered, quickly. \"I come of\r\na family of questioners. It's only now and then that I waver--for a\r\nmoment. My husband said he would come back to me if he could, and I've\r\nbeen half hoping--not really expecting it, you know--\"\r\n\r\nShe did not complete her sentence, and Morton spoke with tender\r\nreproach. \"I am being profoundly illumined, Kate. Why didn't you tell\r\nme that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because it was only a jocular remark. I didn't intend you should know\r\nit. I don't know how I came to let it slip from my mouth. He has never\r\nreturned, strange to say. I feel mother, but never Hayward.\"\r\n\r\nThey had reached a very tender and solemn pause--so self-revealing had\r\nbeen the woman's admission--and Britt was looking at his plate as his\r\nhostess began again with assumed brightness. \"Well, now, about this\r\ngirl. Can you take me to see her? She interests me beyond anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. I should be delighted. But your brother knows her--she\r\nwould be pleased to see you both, I've no doubt.\"\r\n\r\n\"My brother thinks she is a fraud, and does not wish to see her--\"\r\n\r\n\"I derive my knowledge from you, Dr. Britt.\"\r\n\r\nBritt was undisturbed. \"I think she is a fraud, too, but a very\r\ncharming one.\"\r\n\r\n\"That ought to make her all the more convincing,\" said Kate.\r\n\r\n\"And all the more dangerous,\" replied Britt. \"She baffles me--when\r\nface to face with her.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are they going to do with her--exhibit her to the public?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not for the present. Clarke has been making notes industriously all\r\nthe year and is about ready to publish. He now wants a few of the big\r\nfellows, like Uncle Simeon Pratt, to help boom his book. The Lamberts\r\nare not in this for money--please give them credit for that--and as\r\nfor the mother, she is entirely honest--she believes implicitly in her\r\nspirits.\"\r\n\r\n\"That puts the girl in a horrible position--if she _is_ deceiving,\"\r\nMorton interposed. \"Imagine her state of mind if she realizes that her\r\nown mother has come to rest upon her system of deceit. The thought is\r\nhorrible.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is quite as bad at that,\" returned Britt. \"You see, the mother has\r\nbeen for years in close daily communion--as she supposes--with her\r\nhusband, her little son, and others of her dead. Half of her daily\r\nlife is in these joys, the other half in her daughter. There stood the\r\nwall that stopped me. I couldn't express my doubt to the mother. I\r\ncouldn't apply the clamps. I simply withdrew. I do not intend to\r\npursue the matter to a finish so long as the mother is alive.\"\r\n\r\nMorton's face was clouded with pain. \"Let us drop the Lamberts as a\r\nsubject; they are too distressing, especially as I see no way of\r\nhelping them. When do you return?\"\r\n\r\nKate acquiesced in her brother's diversion of the stream of talk, but\r\nan hour later, as Britt was about to go, she seized the opportunity to\r\nsay: \"You must not fail to take me to see this girl. I have never been\r\nso excited about any one in my life. Can't you take me to-morrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am entirely at your service. Suppose I call at four--will that do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly. I'm very grateful to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope you won't come to curse me for it. I warn you, the girl is\r\ndamnably convincing. She may enamour you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No fear of that,\" she cried, in defiant brightness. \"I'm not so\r\neasily fooled.\"\r\n\r\nShe re-entered the library with the flush of an excited conviction in\r\nher face. \"Morton, I feel as if I had taken part in the dissection of\r\na human soul.\"\r\n\r\nHe threw up his hand with a gesture of pain and despair. \"Don't! I can\r\nonly hope that girl is utterly bad. Otherwise she is the sport of\r\ndevils. Help me forget the whole uncanny business.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're wrong,\" she said, firmly. \"It is just such men as you and Dr.\r\nWeissmann who should snatch the pearl of truth from this bucket of\r\nmental mire.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a very good phrase, Kate--if only I was sure of the pearl.\"\r\n\r\nThere really was no way out for him. His mind utterly discredited the\r\nphenomena Viola claimed to produce, and that left but one other\r\ninterpretation. She was a trickster and auto-hypnotist--uncanny as the\r\nfabled women who were fair on one side but utterly foul and corrupt on\r\nthe other. In his musing her splendid, glowing, physical self drew\r\nnear, and when he looked into her sweet, clear eyes his brain reeled\r\nwith doubt of his doubt. If there were any honest eyes in the world,\r\nshe was innocent, and a tortured victim, as Kate had so quickly\r\ndecided; and his plain duty was to beat back the forces seeking to\r\ndevour her.\r\n\r\n\"The mind is an obscure kingdom subject to inexplicable revolts and\r\nsudden confusions,\" he thought. \"Delusions are easy to foment, and at\r\nthe last are indistinguishable from the fact, so far as the mind which\r\ngave them being is concerned. The body of this girl is young, but her\r\nbrain may be cankered by the sins and lies of a long line of decadent\r\nancestry.\" The thought was horrible, but it was less revolting than\r\nthe alternative--in no other way could her life be explained and\r\nexcused. In any case it was highly courageous in her to put marriage\r\naway as decisively as if it were a crime. And this she must have done,\r\nfor even Clarke, according to Britt, had thus far sued in vain. There\r\nwas a heroic strain in the girl somewhere. Was it too late to rescue\r\nher from the mental gangrene eating its way to the very centre of her\r\nsoul? This was the question which only a renewed acquaintance, a\r\ncareful study could resolve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHE PATRON OF PSYCHICS\r\n\r\n\r\nUp to the hour of his wife's death Simeon Pratt had been but the\r\nbusiness-man, large of appetite, pitiless, self-sufficient, and\r\nself-absorbed--the type of man often described by amiable critics as\r\n\"a hard citizen, but good to his family, you know,\" as if the fact of\r\nhis not beating his wife were adequate excuse for railway wrecking.\r\n\r\nHe might be seen taking the 7.49 train at Eighty-sixth Street each\r\nweek-day morning with a bundle of newspapers under his arm, a man of\r\ndepending jowls and protuberant belly, who never offered any one a\r\nseat and did not expect such courtesy from others. He was burly and\r\nselfish as a hog, and was often so designated by work-weary women,\r\nwhom he forced to stand while he read his market reports in callous\r\nabsorption.\r\n\r\nHis associates greeted him with a nod, unsmiling and curt, and the\r\nelevator-boys at the Pratt building were careful not to elbow him. He\r\nhad the greed of a wolf and the temper of an aging bear, and yet his\r\nbusiness ability admittedly commanded respect. Everything he did had a\r\ncertain sweep. He was not penurious or mean in his wars. On the\r\ncontrary, he despised the small revenges; but in a strife with his\r\nequals he was inexorable--he pushed his adversaries to the last ditch,\r\nand into it, remorseless as a mountain land-slide.\r\n\r\nAll the tenderness in his nature, all his faith in goodness and\r\nvirtue, he reserved for his home. To his wife (a woman of simple\r\ntastes and native refinement) and to his children, bright and buxom\r\ngirls of twenty-odd, he was a fond and gruffly indulgent provider,\r\nmaking little protest over new gowns and parties. He had no sons, and\r\nthis was a hidden sorrow to him, and had the effect of centring all\r\nhis paternal pride and care in his daughters. He could deny them\r\nnothing when they wheedled him, and they were nearly always humorously\r\nand brazenly trying to \"work him,\" as he called it. Only in one\r\nparticular had he been granite. With means to build on the east side\r\nof the Park, he had deliberately chosen the Riverside Drive in order\r\nto show his contempt for the social climbers of upper Fifth Avenue,\r\nand neither smiles nor tears had availed to change his plan.\r\n\r\nHis house was a dignified structure exteriorly, but within was\r\ndominated by his taste rather than by that of his daughters, who were\r\nquite unable to change his habits after they were once set. He refused\r\nto consider their suggestions as to furniture. The interior was, as\r\nBritt had said, not unlike a very ornately formal French hotel, and\r\nthis resemblance arose from the fact that he had once enjoyed a\r\npleasant stay in a house of this sort; and when the decorator\r\nsubmitted a number of \"schemes,\" he chose the one which made the\r\npleasantest impression on his mind.\r\n\r\nWith three women at the table, he habitually took charge of the\r\ndinner, controlling the menu and the decorations as well. It amused\r\noutsiders to see him in wordy consultation with the head-waiter and\r\nthe butler while his guest of honor vainly tried to continue some\r\nstory he had begun, but his wife suffered in silence. In short, Simeon\r\nproceeded precisely as he would have done at a restaurant or at his\r\nclub, and his family stood clear of his elbow, the girls with sly\r\nshrugs of their rounded shoulders, the wife meekly, but ineffectually,\r\nprotesting against his usurpation of her domain.\r\n\r\nHe was not politically ambitious, and was in a fair way to grow old as\r\none of the obscure millionaires of New York City when death reached a\r\nsable hand and smote him full in the front of his pride and\r\nassurance--his wife and daughters were lost in the sinking of a boat\r\noff the coast of France.\r\n\r\nThe news of this disaster came to him as he sat at his desk--the\r\nmorning papers had given no hint of it. \"I don't believe it,\" he said,\r\nquietly, and began pressing the buttons of his desk with the same\r\nswift calmness he would have used had the markets been going against\r\nhim. Messages flew to and fro, the wires pulsed with his imperious\r\nanxiety. The manager of the steamboat company answered--denied. The\r\nnews was confirmed, all to the same end; and when Simeon Pratt rose\r\nfrom his desk that night his jaw hung lax, his big form stooped and\r\nshambled as though twenty additional years had suddenly been heaped\r\nupon his shoulders. He went back to his splendid, lonely palace (where\r\nthe servants huddled and whispered and hastened) with a hard, dry knot\r\nin his throat, and with eyes heavy and hot and tearless confronted his\r\nruined altar. From one to be feared he had fallen in a day to the most\r\ndesolate of beings.\r\n\r\nMessengers pursued him. The bodies were recovered. He gave orders for\r\nthem to be shipped by the first boat. In the blaze of the electric\r\nlight, with horrid, staring eyes and stiffly moving lips, he cursed\r\nhimself and God. He cursed himself for letting his treasures go from\r\nhim, he cursed God for permitting such outrages upon justice. At last\r\nhe fell silent, but he did not sleep nor eat till the end of the\r\nsecond day. Then he rose, took the 7.49 train as usual, and returned\r\nto his desk--unshaved, with creased and crumpled clothing, a gray and\r\nbattered man, sustained by habit, seeking relief in work.\r\n\r\nHis associates, with forced cheerfulness, professed pleasure at his\r\nreturn, carefully avoiding mention of his appalling loss. To those who\r\ndid speak of it he returned no word or glance. With fumbling, thick,\r\nand nerveless fingers he took up the purple-lettered ribbon of his\r\ntrade. He fixed his dim eyes on market reports and dictated notes and\r\norders, but it was a poor show. Even those who hated him as a gross,\r\nunlovely character were shocked at his shrunken form, his grayed and\r\ngrizzled cheek. When death deals a blow like that the defeated one\r\nacquires a certain majesty.\r\n\r\nGradually the old man regained ability to compute and combine, and to\r\nconverse with his partners concerning the affairs of the house; but\r\nhis keen interest, his prompt decision of utterance, were all gone.\r\nHis presence in the office was the result of habit merely. In reality\r\nhe was waiting the return of the steamer which bore his precious clay.\r\n\r\nThis boat was delayed by storms, and for three days the broken\r\nfinancier, unable to remain in his office, walked to and fro between\r\nBroad Street and Bowling Green, haunting the office of the steamship\r\ncompany until the bloodless manager, nervous and irritated, left his\r\nchair to avoid him, unable to endure the sight of his haggard face and\r\npiteous eyes.\r\n\r\nWhen the boat arrived, Simeon met it with his own yacht, and, with a\r\nreturn of his iron resolution, stood by to protect the graves of his\r\nhopes as they slid across the rail. Then, ordering every soul from the\r\ncabin, he sat down beside the caskets. He _knew_ that his loved ones\r\nwere there, and yet he could not realize it. He was filled with a\r\ndesire to prove it all a mistake, but the fear--the certainty of the\r\ndisfigured faces--deterred him.\r\n\r\nHe took them home. Nothing could have been more piercingly pathetic\r\nthan that flabby, gray old man, sitting alone amid the tawdry splendor\r\nof his drawing-room with the remains of all he loved in this world\r\nshut away from him by rosewood and silver. When the last pale and\r\nshaking servant had left the room, the father gave one long, hoarse,\r\nchoking wail, and fell upon his face on the floor, crushed and utterly\r\ndespairing.\r\n\r\nWhen he rose he was calmer. He began to give orders for a sumptuous\r\nfuneral, taking charge of every detail in his familiar way. The\r\nceremony was magnificent and profoundly affecting. Every one present\r\nin the great church shed tears of heartfelt sorrow, pitying the great\r\nbanker, quite humanly; but he himself did not weep, he sat limply with\r\neyes on the floor, in a daze of internal emotion; but when the door of\r\nthe vault closed on his dead a final terrible cry burst from him, the\r\ncry of one who realizes to the last and to the full the emptiness, the\r\nfutility of a life without love, an old age without hope.\r\n\r\nHis interest in the material world, in the war of trade, was gone. His\r\nvast wealth would still bring him dividends, and his clerks and\r\npartners would still consult him, still demand his signatures, but the\r\nones who made all these matters worth doing had vanished.\r\n\r\nLife seemed utterly useless, a vain effort, but while yet he struggled\r\nwith the fear of death and a hate of the day, a delegation of those\r\nwho claim to hold communion with the dead came to him with a greeting\r\nfrom his wife. This message contained words which startled him. He was\r\npersuaded to seek confirmation. He was convinced and became the most\r\nfervent of spiritualists. His form lifted, his eyes brightened. A new\r\nworld opened for him. He announced his intention to use his vast\r\nwealth for the faith which had comforted him. He built a magnificent\r\ntemple to the unseen. He hired speakers and musicians to entertain and\r\ninstruct those who came to hear. He sought out and entertained scores\r\nof mediums, psychics, sensitives, inspiritual speakers, and natural\r\nhealers--all were welcome at his hearth. He might have been called,\r\nand was called, \"the prey of harpies,\" but, as his interests now were\r\nin these matters, and as he had the means wherewithal to amuse\r\nhimself, surely he was not a loser. True, he was many times deceived\r\nby false prophets and wronged by fraudulent seers, but still he\r\nenjoyed the exquisite solace which the voice of his wife unfailingly\r\nbrought when the conditions were favorable. He was no longer hopeless;\r\non the contrary, he was reanimated, made over in the faith of the\r\nspirit-world. The daughters came less often to speak to him, but when\r\nthey did come they made his dark, cold heart glow with their gay\r\nwords. At times it seemed that he could reach out his hands and touch\r\ntheir soft cheeks, so palpable were they, so intimate and familiar\r\nwere their voices.\r\n\r\nGradually a part of his old-time business shrewdness came to his aid\r\nin these intangible matters, and he began to distinguish and to cast\r\nout the base and parasitic prestidigitators who infested his house. He\r\ngrew discerning, and was able to weed the tares from the wheat, and\r\nwith this discernment came the conviction that it was his duty to\r\nviolently expose those who sought to cheat him. He became a terror to\r\nthe fraudulent, and by his vigorous denouncement of this and that\r\nperformer raised storms of opposition; for it seemed that no\r\ntrickster, no matter how base, was without a following. His purposes\r\nclarified. Aided by cunning counsel, he began to conceive of himself\r\nas one called to a great mission; and, resigned to his lot, he set\r\nhimself to the work of furthering in every possible way the reign of\r\nthe spirit-world.\r\n\r\nIt was into the hands of this shattered yet still powerful man that\r\nViola Lambert had been persuaded to deliver herself, and Simeon,\r\nconvinced of her powers by experiment, and charmed by her girlish\r\ngrace and dignity, had pushed all other keepers of the door of silence\r\nfrom his house, thereby arousing a tempest of denunciation; for these\r\nsibyls gave up the luxury of his table, the munificence of his purse,\r\nonly after persuasion, and in bitterness and wrath.\r\n\r\nViola's meeting with Pratt was brought about by Clarke, who was aware\r\nthrough the special organs of the faith that the great merchant and\r\npromoter was not merely insatiable in his thirst for new sources of\r\nsolace, but exceedingly generous with his comforters. No sooner had he\r\nsecured the girl's consent to go than he wrote to Pratt asking him to\r\nmeet them in Boston. Receiving no answer (Pratt was afflicted with\r\nsuch letters), he wrote again, detailing the experiments he had made,\r\nlaying great stress upon the fact that the psychic was the daughter of\r\na well-to-do Western mine-owner, that she was a cultured young girl,\r\nand that her mother (a distinguished evangel in the cause) was devoted\r\neven to the point of submitting her daughter to a series of absolutely\r\nconvincing tests. He made mention also of his book, which was nearly\r\nready for the press, and which he hoped would create a great stir\r\namong scientists.\r\n\r\nSimeon did not answer this letter, but sent a representative to\r\nColorow to investigate the writer's claims. The detective returned to\r\nsay that \"the parties\" had gone to Boston, but that they had a fine\r\nreputation in the region, and that the father was a rich and\r\nwell-considered citizen. \"No one knows anything out o' the way with\r\nthe girl,\" the spy added.\r\n\r\nSimeon now flamed with eagerness and set out to find Viola and to test\r\nher. It was not easy to locate her, for Clarke had proceeded with\r\ncaution in Boston. After consultation with the editor of _The\r\nSpiritist_, and at his suggestion, he had given only a few very\r\nprivate sittings to a few very discreet friends. These evenings,\r\nhowever, had been very successful, and those who had been permitted to\r\nattend them had jealously guarded the jewel they had found, selfishly\r\nurging continued secrecy. Nevertheless, the circle had spread, and\r\nViola, apparently resigned to her singular function, was patiently\r\nsitting night after night in stuffy, darkened rooms, while Clarke,\r\nvivid as ever, sonorous as ever, declaimed in passionate rhythms the\r\npromise of a new era for spiritism to be inaugurated by the message of\r\n\"this wonderful organism.\" He had, indeed, laid out an elaborate\r\nprogramme for the capture of Boston, but this he instantly dropped\r\nwhen Simeon Pratt sent up his card and asked to see what the girl\r\ncould do. He demanded a sitting much as a dealer in horses would ask\r\nthe hostler to drive the proffered animal before him in order that he\r\nmight judge of her paces. He did not intend to offend; on the\r\ncontrary, he was instantly consumed with anxiety lest this splendid\r\nyoung creature should refuse to perform.\r\n\r\nViola was deeply offended by his first manner and coldly said: \"I am\r\nnot sitting for money, and I will not be put on exhibition for any\r\none.\"\r\n\r\nSimeon ended by pleading with her for one sitting--one short hour; but\r\nshe refused, and he went away dejected, flabby with defeat. He\r\nreturned next day, and still a third time; and at last, to work on her\r\nsympathies, he told her how he came to enter the faith, and with\r\nbroken voice and quivering lips displayed his sorrows.\r\n\r\nHis weakness availed. The utter tragedy of his life brought the ready\r\ntears to Viola's eyes and quite melted her opposition. She saw him in\r\na new light, understood him for what he really was, a lonely, broken\r\nold man hastening to the grave, and in her pity consented.\r\n\r\nThe manifestation which followed he reported as the most marvellous he\r\nhad ever had. \"Jennie, my eldest daughter, spoke from the megaphone\r\nfor more than an hour, minutely detailing the circumstances of her\r\ndeath, giving orders for the disposition of their jewels and\r\ntrinkets, and in other ways most completely satisfied me of her\r\nidentity.\"\r\n\r\nHe rose from this sitting exalted, comforted beyond measure,\r\npathetically happy, quite ready to embrace the blessed girl who had\r\nmade his hour of sweet communion possible. His home, his private car,\r\nhis yacht were all at her disposal. No queen, however powerful, could\r\nhave won such homage from him. \"You must come to my home,\" he said. \"I\r\nwill enlarge your work. I will meet every wish of your 'guides'.\"\r\n\r\nWith Clarke and the mother on his side, he prevailed. Viola consented\r\nto go to New York as his guest, provided her secret powers were not\r\nrevealed. \"I will not be advertised,\" she said. \"Too many people are\r\ncoming to see me now. If you publish me I will never sit again.\"\r\n\r\nThis threat threw Simeon into a panic. \"Of course you will remain\r\nprivate. You will be my guest, the same as your mother. No one but my\r\nown family shall know of your wonderful powers. I will see to that.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps he was honest in this promise, but his habit of entertaining\r\n\"Arabian Priestesses,\" \"Crystal Gazers,\" and other women of singular\r\nendowments was too well known to permit of the fulfilment of his\r\nagreement. No sooner was Viola seen on the drive in his carriage than\r\nhis friends and hangers-on began to smile and say: \"Simeon has a new\r\nenchantress. I wonder who she is?\" And those remarks aroused the\r\ncuriosity of the ubiquitous workers for the press. Furthermore, the\r\ndirectors of the temple, of course, must needs be told, and the other\r\nseeresses, neglected by their once-idolized patron, did not need to be\r\ntold; so that long before Serviss had a hint of her coming the news of\r\nViola's domestication with Simeon was widely disseminated among the\r\nfaithful, who hurried at once to meet her.\r\n\r\nThese seekers went with smiling faces and hastening feet, but they\r\ncame away laggardly, reproaching the master of the temple for a\r\nselfish brute. Some few were admitted, stayed, and met the girl and\r\nClarke--for Clarke fairly divided the honors, so vivid, so picturesque\r\nwas he. He did not hesitate to speak of his great work, a work which\r\nwould astound the world, and to announce the title of his great\r\noration which Simeon had engaged for the temple. This was the first\r\nbig gun of his campaign, this compelling oration; but he must have\r\nViola's consent to the use of her name--her consent also to sit with a\r\ngroup of chosen great men of the city in order to issue a defiant\r\nchallenge to science. From these special sittings he expected to\r\ndeduce the final and greatest chapter of his book.\r\n\r\nFrom this public test of her power Viola still shrank, but Pratt's\r\nwealth and power, which Clarke continually emphasized, fairly stunned\r\nher into acquiescence. So far from being a faith of the poor, the\r\nobscure, a faith that lurked in dark corners, avoiding the direct gaze\r\nof men, spiritualism from the portals of a resplendent temple appeared\r\nto be not merely respectable but triumphant. From this sacred\r\nmeeting-place of the angelic forces, from the windows of Pratt's\r\npalatial home, she looked out upon the city with more of content with\r\nher mission than she had ever known before--troubled only by a deeply\r\nhidden wish to see again the man whose buoyant health and smiling eyes\r\nhad so strongly impressed her on their ride into the Marshal Basin.\r\n\r\nBut this sense of security of power did not last. As the novelty of\r\nher position in Pratt's household wore away she found her duties\r\nirksome. She resented the flocks of curious or melancholy visitors and\r\nbegan to perceive the bitter truth--that she was only a servant, after\r\nall, ministering to the pleasures of Pratt and his friends. She had\r\nvery little time to herself, and could not escape her masters even for\r\na drive in the Park--one or the other of them was always at her side.\r\n\r\nShe attempted to withdraw her consent to the use of her name, but\r\nClarke, the guides, even her mother, insisted on the test. Britt alone\r\nof all her friends took the side of her fears. They were in\r\ncorrespondence of a formal sort, and when he reached the city he went\r\nstraight to her, anxious to know what Clarke's plans actually were. To\r\nhim she spoke more freely than ever before, expressing her dread of\r\nthe flaring light which Clarke was about to turn upon her.\r\n\r\nBritt listened gravely. \"There is one way of escape,\" he said at last,\r\nwith a smile, both mocking and tender. \"I don't pretend to say it's to\r\nyour mind, but want to remind you that my offer is still open. If you\r\ngive me the necessary authority I will stop this crusade with a jolt.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm grateful to you, Dr. Britt, truly I am, but I can't do what you\r\nask--not even--\" She hesitated and fell silent.\r\n\r\n\"Not even to save your life or mine. I don't blame you--I am but a\r\npoor thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't mean it that way. I respect you very, very much; but you\r\nmust know Anthony depends on me, and, besides, maybe it _is_ my duty\r\nto go on the platform. Father and grandfather both say it is. To them\r\nit seems small and selfish of me to want to be happy in my own home\r\nwhile the millions weep uncomforted; but oh, if I could only live my\r\nown life _part_ of the time! If I could feel free of this terrible\r\nweight one day in seven.\"\r\n\r\nBritt, looking into her clear eyes, acquired a new confidence in her.\r\n\"Tell me, Miss Lambert, do you really believe that your father comes\r\nto you in this way?\"\r\n\r\n\"I dare not doubt it,\" she answered, with evasive eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Some of the messages are not specially--\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" she acquiesced, with a shudder. \"There are evil spirits as\r\nwell as good, and sometimes the bad ones come. I don't see why\r\ngrandfather permits them to use me. He says he can't always help it if\r\nthere are bad people in the circle. That is another reason why I dread\r\nthis public test--there is no knowing what the evil spirits might make\r\nme say or do. If it did not mean so much to Anthony I would\r\nrefuse--even if grandfather asked it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw Professor Serviss to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you?\" Her eyes were instantly alight. \"Where did you see him?\r\nDoes he know we are here?\"\r\n\r\n\"He didn't know till I told him. I called at his laboratory.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you tell him where we are?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; and he felt as I do, that this is not a good place for you.\r\nPratt has the reputation of entertaining sensational characters, and\r\nit will be a miracle if you are not exploited to the press.\"\r\n\r\nHer face clouded again. \"Oh, I am so tired of having people look at me\r\nand shrug and whisper. I am so tired of having this abnormal thing\r\nreflected in the eyes of all my visitors. I wish I could become\r\ncommonplace--without the slightest thing queer about me. Sometimes I\r\nfeel like taking a dose of poison and ending it all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't do that,\" Britt replied, soberly. \"You mustn't even say such a\r\nthing. I wish I could help you, but I see no way so long as your own\r\nparents and Clarke himself are your guides; but if at any time you\r\nwill give me the authority\"--here his voice became stern--\"I will see\r\nthat you are not troubled by any outside influence.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are very kind,\" she said, but her face expressed only a troubled\r\nliking, and he pressed her hand in both of his and silently went away.\r\n\r\nYoung Clinton Ward also came seeking, boyish, eager, contemptuous of\r\nany barrier so illusory as the fact of her trances, which she\r\nconfessed to him. Her words hardly impressed themselves on his mind,\r\nand he replied, flippantly: \"That cuts no ice with me. You couldn't be\r\nanything I wouldn't like. You're living too close and your nerves are\r\nsort of frazzled. What you need is a jolly good time. Come back to\r\nBoston and forget all about this business. Come, I want folks to meet\r\nyou. My mother knows how I feel about you, and is crazy to see you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What would she say if she knew what I have told you?\" she asked,\r\nbitterly.\r\n\r\n\"She won't mind--after she sees you,\" he answered, loyally. \"No one\r\ncan know you without--without--Oh, hang it, Viola, you know what I\r\nmean. Nothing matters when you love a person. I want you, no matter\r\nwhat any one says. And, besides, I don't see why you can't just chuck\r\nthe whole blooming business. I'll chuck Clarke out o' the window, if\r\nyou say the word. He's just trying to work you, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"You mustn't talk that way, Clinton.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not? It's true.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, because--\" She hesitated, then said, as if to end her own\r\nuncertainty: \"I am committed to this life--and to him. My way is\r\nmarked out, and I must walk in it.\"\r\n\r\nThe young fellow was hard hit. He sat looking at her with eyes of\r\nconsternation and awe. He tried to speak, but could not for a little\r\nwhile; at last he made a second trial. \"Do you mean--you _don't_\r\nmean--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I mean--all you think I mean,\" she answered, and then her\r\nfortitude failed her, and she turned away, her eyes filled with hot\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nHe rose awkwardly, all his jaunty self-confidence gone. \"I take my\r\nmedicine. It's all right. I hope you'll be happy--\" He broke off with\r\nquivering lips.\r\n\r\n\"I shall never be happy,\" she said, and the very calmness of her voice\r\nwent to the boy's heart. \"I've given up all hope of being anything but\r\nan instrument--a thing whose wishes do not count. Good-bye, Clint,\"\r\nand she gave her hand.\r\n\r\nHe took it and pressed it hard and went out into the street,\r\nstaggering under the weight of the revelation he had received.\r\n\r\nViola was fond of Clinton--his simple, wholesome, untroubled nature\r\nappealed to her--and yet this very ingenuousness, this ready\r\nconfidence, made her own life and daily habit seem the more\r\nforbidding. She understood now the insuperable barrier which had been\r\nraised between herself and the careless youth of the normal world.\r\n\r\nIn this hour of depression, as in many others, her mind went out\r\ntowards Morton Serviss. Britt's mention of the young scientist's name\r\nseemed to bring him very near, and she wondered again for the\r\nhundredth time whether he had entirely forgotten her or not. Would he\r\ncall, now that he was informed of her presence in the city? She knew\r\n(almost as well as if he had written it) the reason for his hasty\r\nflight from Colorow, and with a knowledge that he considered her a\r\nfreak if not something worse she could not write to him, although she\r\nstill had his card and address.\r\n\r\nHe was a greater man in the world than when he visited their mountain\r\nhome, for he had written a book which the critics called \"a great and\r\nimplacable study of diseases and their uses.\" She had not been able to\r\nread it, but she treasured it, nevertheless, and longed to meet him\r\nagain, to lay her case before him, to ask his advice, not with regard\r\nto whether she should go on with her music, but whether her life was\r\nworth continuing--for there were times when she secretly considered\r\nthe morality of making an end of it. It was in the hope of drawing him\r\nagain to her side that she asked Clarke to include him in the list of\r\nscientific men to whom he was planning to send a printed copy of his\r\noration and challenge--after their delivery--and to her mother she\r\nsaid: \"I would not be so nervous if I knew that Dr. Serviss were on\r\nthe committee; I know he would be just and considerate, even if he\r\ndoes despise mediums.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's exactly the one,\" responded Mrs. Lambert, with enthusiasm. \"I\r\nwonder Tony hasn't spoken of him. Grandfather will be delighted, I'm\r\nsure.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nKATE VISITS VIOLA\r\n\r\n\r\nTowards Simeon's portal, held sacred to \"The Keepers of the Keys of\r\nthe Silent House,\" Kate Rice and Dr. Britt set their faces at the\r\nappointed hour.\r\n\r\n\"The plot thickens round the girl,\" began Britt, with a kind of\r\nmocking levity. \"Mrs. Lambert has done it now!\"\r\n\r\nThey had reached the comparative quiet of the cross-street. \"What has\r\nshe done?\"\r\n\r\n\"She has delivered her ewe-lamb over to this ancient wolf of Wall\r\nStreet, who will eat her up for a Little Red Riding-hood. I've been\r\nlooking into Pratt's record. He has a cheerful way, I'm told, of\r\ntreating his 'psychics' like oranges--squeezing them and throwing them\r\ninto the street. He has become so sensitive to the sneers of the\r\noutsiders that he fears to be 'done.' After getting all that a medium\r\ncan give him, he 'exposes' her elaborately, and sets her adrift, and\r\nso guards himself from the possible accusation of having been\r\ndeceived. If there is any question of the medium's powers, he can then\r\ncome out with a card saying: 'I knew So-and-so was a fraud. I exposed\r\nher two years--or two months--ago.' I see the girl's finish right\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"The dreadful old man! Does the girl know this?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think she does, but she ought to. I hate to see a nice girl,\r\nwho would make some one a charming wife, perverted to these unholy\r\nuses. The crowning infamy heaped upon her head will be a full page in\r\nthe _Sunday Blast_--'Another Harpie Exposed'--and it will come, Mrs.\r\nRice, I am sure of it. Pratt fairly fawns before her now. She is his\r\nprincess, his seeress, his chief jewel; but woe to her if she\r\ndispleases him or fails to meet his requirements.\"\r\n\r\n\"You appall me, Dr. Britt. Some one should at least warn her.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've already done so; but with the mother, Clarke, and Pratt to war\r\nagainst, the case seems hopeless. Besides, she believes in herself--up\r\nto a certain point. She'll never degenerate into one of those frumps\r\nwho go from city to city playing to the foolish women and tack-headed\r\nmen, but she will certainly be corrupted. If she marries Clarke her\r\nfuture will be woful. She has entered in so far I don't see how she\r\ncan retreat. She is bound to keep on for his sake and her mother's\r\nsake.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is she in love with Clarke?\"\r\n\r\n\"That I haven't been able to determine, but she is under his control,\r\nor she wouldn't be here.\"\r\n\r\nWith these gloomy words in her ears Kate entered the big, cold\r\ndrawing-room to wait for the coming of the master of the house.\r\n\r\n\"Pratt is the one to whom you are to pay your first respects--he is\r\nmaster,\" warned Britt. \"Ask to see his collections--that always\r\npleases him. If you will permit, I will lead the way.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am trusting you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may do so.\"\r\n\r\nPratt came in quite briskly, a heavy-faced, white-bearded man, wearing\r\na sack-suit and an old-fashioned turn-down collar. He greeted Britt\r\nwith a casual hand-shake, looking at Kate suspiciously. \"And who is\r\nthis?\" he asked, bluffly.\r\n\r\n\"A friend of mine, a Mrs. Rice, who desires to see your wonderful\r\ncollection of slates and paintings.\"\r\n\r\nPratt softened a little. \"I'll be very glad to show them,\" he said,\r\n\"but not now. I'll have to ask you to excuse me just now. I am in\r\nconsultation with my directors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said Britt, and, after Pratt went out, he added: \"That\r\nmeans that Clarke is going to launch his thunderbolt. He's going to\r\ndefy the scientific world in the most burning oration since Cicero.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment two ladies, in superb wraps, descended the stairway on\r\ntheir way to their carriages, and one of them said, \"I think it's a\r\nshame--as long as we've known Simeon Pratt--to be turned away like a\r\ntramp!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't blame her,\" said the other.\r\n\r\n\"Some disappointed callers,\" said Britt.\r\n\r\nA moment later several other curious ones were ushered into the\r\ndrawing-room. Britt kept up a low-toned comment. \"All these\r\nrubber-necks are here to see the girl. You will be surprised to know\r\nhow many there are with a sneaking belief in these revelations.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a singular situation in which to find Simeon Pratt--major-domo\r\nto a crowd of idle curiosity-seekers--and when he returned, with an\r\nassumption of haste and bustle, Britt saw him in a new light--that of\r\na poor, lonely, broken old man, weary of life, yet living on in daily\r\nhope of communion with the dead, stuffing his heart with dreams and\r\ndelusions, walking mechanically round, interested only in death.\r\n\r\nHe had forgotten Kate's name, but he remembered her wish to see his\r\ntreasures.\r\n\r\n\"Come to my library,\" he said; \"but first let me call your attention\r\nto this remarkable painting.\"\r\n\r\nThe painting--or rather wash-drawing in black-and-white--hung over the\r\ngrand-piano in the light of the west windows. It was globular in form,\r\nand represented, Simeon explained, the \"War of Light and Darkness.\"\r\nOne-half of the globe was darkly shaded, curiously fretted by the\r\nlighter half. Above sat a snow-white eagle. Beneath, with prodigious\r\nwings outspread, and eyes gleaming like points of fire, hovered a\r\nmysterious bat.\r\n\r\n\"Look closer,\" commanded Simeon.\r\n\r\nNarrower scrutiny brought out, even in the darker half of the globe, a\r\nmultitude of intertwined forms, outlined with pen and ink. Those of\r\nthe lighter hemisphere were beautiful as angels, with faint stars in\r\ntheir hair. All were singing. The others, the denizens of the dark,\r\nwere twisted and contorted in agony, and each was drawn with such\r\ncertainty of prearrangement that the line which formed the arm of one\r\noutlined the head of another. There were hundreds of them, and the\r\nwhole work was as intricate in design as the engraving on a bank-note,\r\nand so packed with symbolism--according to Simeon's exegesis--that one\r\nmight study it for days. \"Observe,\" said he, \"the innumerable faces\r\nformed by the line which divides the two worlds. Take these glasses.\"\r\n\r\nKate, by means of the powerful instrument which he thrust upon her,\r\nwas able to detect hundreds of other faces invisible to the unaided\r\neye. \"It is wonderful. Who did it?\"\r\n\r\n\"A Swedish servant-girl,\" answered Simeon, loudly, addressing every\r\none in the room. \"She couldn't write her name; but when the spirit of\r\nRaphael controlled her she could do this with her eyes shut. There's\r\nnothing like that picture in the world. It cannot be duplicated by any\r\nartist in the flesh.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's no dream,\" murmured Britt.\r\n\r\nPratt hurried them on, past many other equally wonderful paintings, to\r\nhis library, and as his guests filed in he faced them. \"The things I\r\nam about to show you have no equal anywhere. They have taken years to\r\ncollect, and have cost me more than a hundred thousand dollars. I can\r\nshow you but a few.\"\r\n\r\nThe library was a splendid room, rich with the light of the western\r\nsun, whose arrangement instantly struck Kate Rice as unusual, for the\r\nbook-shelves were precisely like those of a butler's pantry. They\r\nbegan at about four feet from the floor and reached entirely to the\r\nceiling, and were filled with splendid, neglected books, while beneath\r\na broad shelf, at their base, were rows of little brass knobs, each of\r\nwhich indicated a shallow drawer. Each drawer had a lock and a small\r\nplate which bore a letter and a number, not unlike the cabinet of a\r\nnumismatist.\r\n\r\n\"There are but two keys in existence,\" explained Simeon, with shining\r\nface. \"The one I now hold and the one in my safety vaults. No one is\r\npermitted in this room without my secretary or myself.\" He moved down\r\nthe room between the cabinet and the big table. \"Here is a message\r\nfrom Columbus.\" He unlocked and drew out one of the drawers and laid\r\nit upon the table. It was exquisitely made, and contained two ordinary\r\nhinged school-slates, with the inner sides visible, but protected by a\r\nheavy plate of glass. \"This message came to me through Angelica\r\nCox--under test conditions,\" Pratt further explained, as Kate bent\r\nabove it.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by test conditions?\" asked Britt.\r\n\r\n\"I mean, sir, that I bought and took these slates to the medium, and\r\nheld them in my hands while that message was written.\" There was\r\nirritation in his voice. He replaced the drawer. \"But here is a\r\npainting from Murillo, the great artist. He painted the face of one of\r\nthe ancients.\" He laid before his silent auditors another drawer which\r\ncontained a sheet of card-board on which was a fairly good pastel of\r\nan Arab in a burnouse. It had the weak and false drawing which would\r\nresult in the attempt of an amateur to copy an engraving in color.\r\n\"This came in broad daylight while I held the clean card-board on my\r\nhead,\" explained Simeon.\r\n\r\nBritt looked at Kate. \"The painter might have stood on his head,\" he\r\nblasphemously whispered.\r\n\r\nAnd so down through that splendid room the host moved, exhibiting\r\nletters from Napoleon, flowers from Marie Antoinette, verses from Mary\r\nQueen of Scots, together with paternal advice from many others equally\r\neminent in history.\r\n\r\n\"You keep good company,\" ventured Kate. \"Have you anything from\r\nShakespeare?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly; and from Edwin Forrest and Lincoln and Grant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anything from Admiral Kidd?\" asked Britt.\r\n\r\n\"Or from Mary Jane Holmes?\" added Kate.\r\n\r\nSimeon looked at the jokers in silence, not quite sure whether they\r\nintended to trap him or not. \"No, I save only the words of the most\r\neminent persons in history, outside my own family--I have wonderful\r\ntestimony from them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, show us those, please,\" cried Kate.\r\n\r\nHe hesitated, pondering Britt's face, and at last said, \"I will show\r\nyou some materializations,\" and led the way to some cases filled with\r\npressed flowers. \"These are from India and Tibet,\" he explained.\r\n\r\nKate was getting bored, but Britt seemed fascinated by both Pratt and\r\nthe exhibit. \"To think of one human being possessing a collection like\r\nthat--painfully amassing it. It's too beautiful!\"\r\n\r\n\"But the girl--ask him to let us see the girl,\" she urged.\r\n\r\n\"Don't hurry; he can't be turned aside from his groove.\"\r\n\r\nThe treasures of the drawers hinted at, Simeon proceeded to exhibit\r\nother wonders. He possessed a coin brought from the sacred city of\r\nLhasa and dropped through the ceiling into a closed and sealed box.\r\n\"There is no other known to the Western Hemisphere,\" he said. \"The\r\nBritish Museum offered me a thousand pounds for it.\"\r\n\r\nTo his mind all these slates, pictures, and flowers were evidences of\r\nthe interest the great shades had taken in the work of converting\r\nSimeon Pratt to the faith, and the messages were intended to steady\r\nhim in his convictions and to furnish him material with which to bring\r\nthe world to his view. The man's faith was like to madness--without\r\none ray of humor.\r\n\r\nAt any other time this astounding museum would have been a most\r\nabsorbing study to Kate, but she was tingling with desire to get at\r\nthe young seeress and her mother. \"What must they be,\" she asked\r\nherself, \"to mix with this kind of idiocy?\"\r\n\r\nAt last, when the favoring pause came, Britt explained to Pratt that\r\nMrs. Rice was the sister of one who had known Viola in the West, and\r\nthat she very much wished to see the psychic for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"I think Miss Lambert is engaged,\" replied Simeon, sulkily; \"but I'll\r\nsee,\" and he led the way to a small sitting-room on the same floor.\r\n\"Stay here and I'll send your card up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell her a sister of Professor Serviss.\"\r\n\r\nSimeon turned quickly. \"Serviss--ain't he one of the men that Clarke\r\ntalks of having on the committee? Are you his sister?\"\r\n\r\nKate bowed. \"Yes; my brother met Miss Lambert in the West.\"\r\n\r\nPratt's face cleared. \"Well, well! I will send her right down. Your\r\nbrother is the kind of man we want to reach,\" he added, as he went\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Dr. Britt,\" began Kate, firmly, \"I want you to keep that\r\nboresome old man occupied while I talk with these women. I don't want\r\nhim putting in his oar.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll do my best,\" he answered, manfully, \"up to the measure of\r\ngagging him. I can't agree to order him out of the house.\"\r\n\r\nKate was on her chair's edge with interest as she heard the rustle of\r\nskirts and the murmur of a pleasant voice, and when Viola, flushed,\r\nsmiling, beautifully gowned, entered the room with outstretched hand,\r\nshe rose with a spring, carried out of her well-planned reserve by the\r\nwarmth and charm of the girl's greeting. She closed her gloved palm\r\ncordially on the fine hand so confidingly given. \"I am glad to know\r\nyou. My brother has spoken so enthusiastically of you.\"\r\n\r\nViola's flush deepened. \"Has he? I assure you we speak often of him.\r\nI suppose he is too busy with his wonderful microbes to come and see\r\npoor, commonplace creatures like us.\"\r\n\r\n\"He _is_ busy, but he only learned of your presence a few days ago.\"\r\n\r\nViola turned. \"Mother, this is Mrs. Rice, Professor Serviss's sister.\"\r\n\r\nKate liked Mrs. Lambert also, for she was looking remarkably handsome\r\nin a black gown of simple pattern. \"If these are adventuresses they\r\nare very clever in dress,\" was her inward comment. \"I don't wonder\r\nMorton was captivated.\" And she presently said: \"Can't you take me to\r\nyour own room? I want to talk secrets with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, let us do that.\" Viola turned to her mother. \"Let's take Mrs.\r\nRice to our sitting-room.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lambert assented timidly, with a quick glance towards Simeon, who\r\nwas garrulously declaiming to Britt concerning the wonders of another\r\npainting by the Swedish cook.\r\n\r\nPratt, seeing the women rise, approached. \"Where are you going?\" he\r\nasked, with a note of impatience in his voice.\r\n\r\n\"To my room,\" answered Viola, firmly, and led the way up-stairs in\r\nsilence; but when they were beyond earshot in the hall above she\r\nbitterly exclaimed: \"He spies on everything I do. He will hardly let\r\nme out of his sight. I am beginning to hate him, he has so little\r\nsense of decency.\"\r\n\r\n\"Viola!\" warned the mother.\r\n\r\n\"I don't care,\" retorted the girl, defiantly. \"Why do we endure\r\nhim--we are not dependent on him. He treats us precisely as if he\r\nowned us, and I'm tired of it. I wish papa would come on and take us\r\nhome.\"\r\n\r\n\"He may be a bore, but he houses you like royalty,\" Kate remarked, as\r\nshe glanced about the suite which Viola and her mother occupied. It\r\nformed the entire eastern end of the third floor of the house, and the\r\ndecorations were Empire throughout, with stately canopied beds and a\r\nmost luxurious bath-room.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, it's beautiful; but I would rather be this minute in our\r\nlittle log-cabin in the West,\" answered the girl, with wistful\r\nsadness. \"Oh, these warm days make me homesick. When I was there I\r\nhated it, now I long to get back. I seem five years older--this winter\r\nhas been terribly long to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, lock the door,\" exclaimed Kate, excitedly, \"and tell me\r\nall about yourself. Start at the very beginning. Dr. Britt has told me\r\nsomething, but I want to know everything. When did you first know you\r\nhad this power? That's the first question.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lambert began in the tone of one retelling an old story. \"Up till\r\nthe day my little son Walter died, Viola was just like any other girl\r\nof her age--healthy and pretty--a very pretty child.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can believe it.\" Kate's eyes dwelt admiringly on the girl.\r\n\r\n\"My husband and I were good Presbyterians, and I had never given much\r\nthought to spirits or spiritualism, but after our little boy died\r\nRobert began to study up, and every time we went to the city he'd go\r\nto see a psychic, and that troubled me. As a good church-member I\r\nthought he ought not to do it, and so one day I said, 'Robert, I think\r\nyou ought to tell Mr. McLane'--that was our minister--'what you are\r\ndoing. It isn't right to visit mediums and go to church, too--one or\r\nthe other ought to be given up.' He said--I remember his exact words:\r\n'I can't live without these messages of comfort from my boy. They say\r\nhe is going to manifest himself soon--here in our own home.' I\r\nremember that was his exact expression, for I wondered what it was to\r\nmanifest. That very night things began.\"\r\n\r\nKate's eyes snapped. \"What things?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Waltie had a little chair that he liked--a little reed\r\nrocking-chair--and my husband always kept this chair close by where he\r\nsat reading. That night I saw the chair begin to rock all by\r\nitself--and yet, some way, it didn't scare me. 'Robert, did you move\r\nWaltie's chair?' I asked. 'No,' he said. 'Why?' 'Because it rocked.'\r\nRobert threw down his book and looked at the chair. 'Viola must have\r\nmoved it,' he said. 'Viola was in her own little chair on the other\r\nside of the table,' I said. 'It must have been the cat, then.'\r\n\r\n\"And then, just while we both looked at it, it began to move again\r\nexactly as if Waltie were in it. It creaked, too, as it used to when\r\nhe rocked.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should have been frightened stiff,\" exclaimed Kate, whose eyes were\r\nbeginning to widen.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing that has happened since has given me such a turn. Robert\r\njumped up and felt all about the chair, sure that Viola had tied a\r\nstring to it--and still she was no child for tricks. Then Robert bent\r\nright down over the chair, and it stopped for a moment, and then slid\r\nbackward under the table, just as our own boy used to do. He loved to\r\nplay tent. Robert looked up at me as white as the dead. 'It is Waltie,\r\nmother; he has come back to us,' he said, and I believed it, too.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of herself, Kate shivered with a keen, complete comprehension\r\nof the thrilling joy and terror of that moment, but Viola sat\r\nlistlessly waiting the end of her mother's explanation. Plainly, it\r\nwas all a wearisome story to her.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lambert went on: \"After that he came every night, and soon the\r\ntappings began, and finally we got into communication with my father,\r\nwho told us to be patient and wait and Waltie would speak to us. Then\r\nthe power took hold of Viola and frightened her almost into fits.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl visibly shuddered and her eyes fell.\r\n\r\n\"How did it begin?\" asked Kate, breathless with interest.\r\n\r\n\"The first we noticed was that her left arm began to twitch so that\r\nshe couldn't control it. Then she took to writing with her left hand,\r\nexactly like my father's hand-writing. She could write twenty\r\ndifferent kinds of writing before she was twelve. These messages were\r\nall signed, and all said that she was to be a great medium. Then\r\nbegan the strangest doings. My thimbles would be stolen and hidden,\r\nvases would tumble off the mantels, chairs would rock. It was just\r\npandemonium there some nights. They used to break things and pound on\r\nthe doors; then all of a sudden these doings stopped and Viola went\r\ninto deathly trances. I shall never forget that first night. We\r\nthought she was dead. We couldn't see her breathe, and her hands and\r\nfeet were like ice.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl rose, her face gray and rigid. \"Don't mother, don't!\" she\r\nwhispered. \"_They are here!_\" She shook her head and cried out as if\r\nto the air: \"No, no, not now! No, no!\"\r\n\r\nThe mother spoke. \"She is being entranced. Some one has a message for\r\nyou, Mrs. Rice?\"\r\n\r\nFor the first time, Kate had a suspicion of both mother and daughter.\r\nThis action of the girl seemed a thought too opportune and much too\r\ntheatric. Now that her splendid eyes were clouded she lost confidence\r\nin her, and as she waited she grew cold with a kind of disgust and\r\nfear of what was to follow.\r\n\r\nThe mother gently sided with her daughter against the control, and,\r\ntaking both her hands, said, quietly: \"Not now, father, not now.\" But\r\nin vain. The girl sank back into her chair rigid. \"They have something\r\nthey insist on saying, Mrs. Rice,\" said Mrs. Lambert, after a silence.\r\n\"Is it some one for Mrs. Rice?\" Three loud snapping sounds came from\r\nthe carpet under Viola's feet.\r\n\r\n\"Good gracious! What is that?\" exclaimed Kate, a cold tremor passing\r\nup her spine.\r\n\r\n\"It is my father,\" answered Mrs. Lambert, quite placidly. \"Can't you\r\nwrite, father? Be easy on Viola to-day.--He is very anxious to\r\nconverse with you for some reason, Mrs. Rice.\"\r\n\r\nAgain a creeping thrill made Kate's hair rise, and she bit her\r\nfinger-tip. \"Am I dreaming?\" she asked herself, as she listened to the\r\nmother talking to the air, only to be answered by rappings from the\r\ntable and thumpings from the chairs. \"How absurd, how childish it all\r\nis!\" she thought.\r\n\r\nEven as this thought passed through her mind, the room seemed to\r\ndarken, the air to thicken. The girl's proud young body sank, doubled\r\ntill she seemed a crone, old and withered and jocose; a sneering laugh\r\ncame from her drawn lips; her hands, trembling together, hookedly\r\nreached towards Kate; the eyes were sunk lidless and gleaming with\r\nmalice; a voice that was like the croak of a raven sounded forth: \"You\r\ngot my money, Kit--but you didn't get it all.\" And from the young,\r\ndistorted lips a disgusting laugh issued, a laugh that froze Kate's\r\nblood and stiffened her tongue so that she could not cry out. She\r\ngasped and sank back into her chair, while the voice went on: \"You\r\nknow me. I always hated you--you wasted my money--you poisoned my\r\npets--I hated your husband--he cheated me once--you'll get no joy of\r\nmy money till you pay that debt.\"\r\n\r\nKate, inert, aghast, sat blindly staring while this vindictive,\r\nremorseless voice went on; only when it stopped was she aware of the\r\nmother's serene attitude of waiting, of polite regret at being present\r\nat a disagreeable scene; then the girl's lips resumed their sweetness,\r\nthe beautiful hands fell slack upon her knees, the head lifted and,\r\nturning, rested peacefully against the cushion of her chair. The table\r\nwas violently shaken. A small ornament upon it leaped into the air and\r\nfell in Kate's lap. She sprang to her feet with a cry of alarm,\r\nshaking the thing away as if it were a toad, and was about to flee\r\nwhen Mrs. Lambert's voice struck her into immobility, so unconcerned\r\nwas it, so utterly matter of fact.\r\n\r\n\"Did you know the spirit visitor?\" she asked.\r\n\r\nWith the question Kate's panic ceased. Her awe, her fright, passed\r\ninto wonder and amazement.\r\n\r\n\"It was exactly like my great-aunt,\" she gaspingly admitted. \"But, oh,\r\nit was terrible! Why _do_ you let her go into such states?\"\r\n\r\n\"We cannot control these manifestations. Hush! They are not yet\r\nfinished. They are about to write for you.\"\r\n\r\nStill lying in languid ease, the girl lifted one hand to the table--to\r\nKate it seemed that the hand was raised by some outside invisible\r\npower--and there it rested, as though weary and meditating. As it\r\npaused thus the girl's eyes opened, and she sat regarding it as though\r\nit belonged to some other intruding self. Mrs. Lambert brought a\r\npencil and a pad of paper, and laid them upon the stand.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the hand woke to vigorous action. Seizing the pencil as a dog\r\nmight lay hold upon a bone, it began to write slowly, firmly, while\r\nViola watched it, quietly, detachedly, as if it were something\r\nentirely separate from her brain. At the end it tore the leaf from the\r\npad and flung it to the floor.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lambert picked it up. \"It is from father,\" she said; \"but it is\r\nfor you.\"\r\n\r\nKate took the leaf, on which was written, in a firm, round,\r\nold-fashioned hand, these words: \"Your aunt is here, and asks that you\r\nand your brother pay her debt. She is angry because it has not been\r\ndone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no knowledge of any such debt,\" said Kate. \"I don't understand\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\nThe hand was writing again, busily, imperturbably, and the color was\r\ncoming back into Viola's face. As Kate waited, her awe began to pass,\r\nand doubts came thronging back upon her. There was something farcical\r\nin all this.\r\n\r\nAgain the hand flung its message, and again the mother picked it from\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\n\"This also is from father,\" she announced, with more of excitement\r\nthan she had hitherto betrayed.\r\n\r\nThe message began abruptly: \"The doubter may be convinced if he will\r\nbut put himself in the way of it. The life of my granddaughter is more\r\nvaluable to-day than that of any king or queen. Her mission is to open\r\nthe door between the two worlds. She is here ready for the test. Let\r\nthe men of science come to her and be convinced of the life beyond\r\nthe grave.\" It was signed with an elaborate rubric \"McLeod.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is this message for, father?\" asked Mrs. Lambert. \"Mrs. Rice?\"\r\n\r\nA violent thump answered \"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe it's for my brother,\" suggested Kate.\r\n\r\nThree tremendous thumps upon the underside of the table gave\r\naffirmative answer.\r\n\r\nKate was quite restored to her ruddy self. \"Very well, I will see that\r\nhe gets it.\"\r\n\r\nViola now spoke wearily, but quite in her natural voice again. \"There\r\nis no test in that kind of a message. I didn't write it--I had nothing\r\nto do with it; but you or Professor Serviss would be justified in\r\nthinking I did. Grandpa wanted me to go into a trance. This kind of\r\nwriting is a compromise.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what of my aunt who spoke through you?\" asked Kate.\r\n\r\nViola stared at her blankly, and her mother laid a warning hand on\r\nKate's arm. \"She knows nothing of these impersonations,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"What did I do?\" asked Viola. \"I hope nothing ridiculous.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Rice's aunt spoke through you, that's all,\" answered Mrs.\r\nLambert, reassuringly.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me more,\" said Kate, eagerly. \"It is all so unreal to me--I want\r\nto see more. Dr. Britt has told us wonderful things of you. Do you\r\nreally believe the dead speak to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are with us all the time,\" placidly, yet decisively, answered\r\nMrs. Lambert. \"We are never alone. I can feel them always near.\"\r\n\r\nKate shrank. \"I don't believe I like that--altogether. Don't you feel\r\noppressed by the thought?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I do,\" answered Viola; \"they take all the joy out of my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dearest!\" warned the mother.\r\n\r\n\"It is true, and I want Mrs. Rice to know it. Since I was ten years\r\nold I have not been free of the thing for a day--only in the high\r\nmountains. There I could always draw a long breath. I am glad you've\r\ncome, Mrs. Rice. I want you to ask Professor Serviss to come and\r\ninvestigate me. My only hope is in the men of science. Tell him I want\r\nhim to help me understand myself.\" She was speaking now with force and\r\nheat. \"I want him to padlock me and nail me down. I want to know\r\nwhether I am in the hands of friends or enemies. Sometimes I think\r\ndevils are playing with me. All my life I've been tortured by these\r\npowers; even at school they came banging about my bed, scaring my\r\nroom-mates. They disgraced me before my teacher, the one I loved best.\r\nThey interfered with my music, they cut me off from my friends, and\r\nnow they've landed me here in this strange house with this dreadful\r\nold man, and I want some one, some good man who knows, some one who is\r\nnot afraid, to come and test me. Mamma never doubts, Mr. Clarke is\r\nentirely satisfied, and this Mr. Pratt is worse than all. I don't\r\nbelieve in his pictures, I don't believe in what I do--I don't know\r\nwhat I believe,\" she ended, despairingly; then added, fiercely: \"This\r\nI _do_ know, I want to be free from it--free, free--absolutely free. I\r\npray to God to release me, but He does not, and my slavery grows worse\r\nevery day.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl's intensity of utterance thrilled Kate to the heart. Here was\r\nthe cry of a tortured soul, the appeal of one in bondage. Dr. Britt\r\nwas right, she was a victim.\r\n\r\n\"You poor thing. I begin to understand. _I_ will help you, and so will\r\nmy brother. He is already interested in you. He is just the one to\r\nadvise with you. If any one can help you he can. He is so keen-eyed,\r\nso strong.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know he is. Have him come soon, won't you?\"\r\n\r\nThe mother interposed. \"But, dearie, you know Mr. Clarke says--\"\r\n\r\n\"I know what he says,\" the girl answered, her face sullen and weary\r\nagain. \"He and all of you have no regard for me. You pretend to have,\r\nbut you are all willing to sacrifice me to prove a theory. I don't\r\ncare whether spiritualism is true or not, I want to have one single\r\nday when I can be sure of being myself, free to come and go like other\r\ngirls. I feel as if I had a band of iron around my neck. I shall go\r\nmad with it some day.\"\r\n\r\nKate, usually ready, blunt, and fearless, sat in silence, perfectly\r\nconvinced by the fury of the girl's protest, stunned by a belief in\r\nthe complete truth of her indignant accusations. These devotees, these\r\nfanatics, were immolating a beautiful young life on the altar of\r\ntheir own selfish faith. The virgin was already bound to the rock, and\r\nthe priest, torch in hand, was about to apply the flame.\r\n\r\n\"What can _I_ do? I want to help you--\"\r\n\r\nAn imperious knock at the door interrupted her, and for an instant\r\nKate thought this another spirit message, but Mrs. Lambert called out,\r\n\"Is that you, Anthony?\"\r\n\r\nA deep voice answered, \"Yes, it is I. I have something to tell you.\"\r\nClarke opened the door and stepped within, a handsome, dark,\r\ntheatrical figure.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lambert rose to meet him. \"What is it, Anthony?\"\r\n\r\n\"We've decided on the date. I am to speak on the second,\" he answered\r\nexultantly.\r\n\r\nViola started up. \"You shall not use my name. I forbid it!\" Her hands\r\nwere clinched, her eyes blazed with the fury of her determination, and\r\nshe struck her heel upon the floor. \"I tell you I forbid it!\"\r\n\r\nClarke pushed Mrs. Lambert aside and strode to the centre of the room;\r\nhis face was hard, his tone contemptuous. \"You forbid it! What is your\r\npuny will against the invisible ones? You forbid it?\" His voice\r\nchanged as he asked, \"Who has influenced you to _this_ childish\r\nrevolt?\" He turned to Kate. \"Have you, madam?\"\r\n\r\nKate Rice was not one to be outfaced. \"If I have, I shall be most\r\nhappy,\" she answered. \"Who are you that demand so much of this poor\r\ngirl?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am the one chosen by her 'control' to convey their message to the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\nKate recoiled a little. \"Oh, you are? Well, I don't care if you are.\r\nYou have no right to use her name in this way without her consent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Her consent! What she desires or what I desire is of small account.\r\nWe are both in the grasp of the invisible forces, making for the\r\nhappiness of the race. She can't refuse to go on. It is her duty.\r\nThere are millions of other women to sing, to dance, to amuse\r\nmen--there is only one Viola Lambert in the world. Nothing in the\r\nannals of the occult exceeds her wonderful mediumship. She _must_ give\r\nherself to the world of science. She _must_ help us to prevail over\r\nthe terrors of the grave. Her mission is magnificent. Her fame will\r\nfill the earth.\"\r\n\r\nKate stoutly confronted him. \"Perhaps the fame you give her will\r\ndestroy her. It sounds to me like notoriety rather than fame. This\r\npoor child has a right to herself, and I will help her assert it.\"\r\n\r\nClarke's eloquent hand fell to his side. Something in Kate's calm,\r\nmatter-of-fact speech reached his shrewder self. He perceived here no\r\nmean antagonist. \"You need not take the trouble, madam. I am guarding\r\nher. _They_ are guarding her.\"\r\n\r\nIt was plain that both Mrs. Lambert and her daughter were profoundly\r\nin obedience if not in terror of this wild young evangel, and Kate, to\r\ntest her divination, said, \"Suppose she refuses?\"\r\n\r\n\"She dare not refuse. Her 'control' would cut her down where she\r\nstands. She has no choice where they are concerned. The hands are upon\r\nher this moment,\" he ended, triumphantly.\r\n\r\nA shudder of despair went over the girl. \"It's true; I feel them\r\nhere.\" She touched her throat. \"They are all against me--the living\r\nand the dead,\" and she fell into her chair with a moan of despair, her\r\nbeauty, her shining garments adding to the pity of her fate. Kate's\r\nheart went out to her without reservation as she knelt beside her.\r\n\r\n\"I am for you, my dear, and so is my brother; we will help you, I give\r\nyou my word. Be brave. You must see Morton and Dr. Weissmann. They\r\nwill know what to do.\"\r\n\r\nViola turned upon her mother with a wail of supplication. \"Take me\r\nhome, mother, take me home!\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lambert herself was weeping now. \"I dare not, dearie, not till\r\n_they_ consent. Be patient--they have promised to release you after\r\nthis test.\"\r\n\r\nOver the girl's face a stony rigidity spread, her eyelids drooped, her\r\nhead rolled from side to side, a pitiful, moaning cry came from her\r\npinched lips, and then, at last, drawing a long, peaceful sigh, she\r\nslept.\r\n\r\nKate, in terror, stood watching, waiting till the lines of struggle,\r\nof pain, smoothed out, and the girl, doubly beautiful in her\r\nresignation, lay like one adorned for the angel of death. Then Clarke\r\nsaid, solemnly: \"She has ceased to struggle. She is in good hands, in\r\nthe care of those who love her and understand her; when she wakes she\r\nwill be newly consecrated to her great work. Come.\"\r\n\r\nKate, awed and helpless, permitted him to lead her from the room, but\r\nwhen fairly outside she turned upon him fiercely: \"Don't touch me. I\r\ndespise you. You are all crazy, a set of fanatics, and you'd sacrifice\r\nthat poor girl without a pang. But you sha'n't do it, I tell you--you\r\nsha'n't do it!\"\r\n\r\nAnd with that defiant phrase she swept past him down to the street,\r\nforgetting Dr. Britt in her frenzy of indignation and defeat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nSERVISS LISTENS SHREWDLY\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Morton, with an armful of the publications of \"The Society\r\nfor Psychical Research\" before him, was busied with the arguments of\r\nthe spiritists and their bearings on Viola Lambert's case.\r\n\r\nThe thing claimed--that the dead spoke through her--he could not for a\r\nmoment entertain. Such a claim was opposed to all sound thinking, to\r\nevery law known to science--was, in short, preposterous.\r\n\r\nHe had acquired all the prejudices against such a faith from Emerson's\r\nfamous phrase, \"rat-hole philosophy,\" down to the latest sneer in the\r\neditorial columns of _The Pillar_, to the latest \"exposé\" in _The\r\nBlast_. Upon the most charitable construction, those who believed in\r\nrappings, planchettes, materialized forms, ghosts, messages on slates,\r\nand all the rest of the amazing catalogue, were either half-baked\r\nthinkers, intellectual perverts, or soft-pated sentimentalists, whose\r\njudgment was momentarily clouded by the passing of a grief.\r\n\r\n\"And yet,\" said one author, \"go a little deeper and you will find in\r\nthe very absurdities of these phenomena a possible argument for their\r\ntruth. A manufactured system would be careful to avoid putting\r\nforward as evidence a thing so childish and so ludicrous as a spirit\r\ntipping a table, writing in a bottle, or speaking through a tin horn.\r\nWho but a childlike and trusting soul would expect to convince a man\r\nof science of the immortality of the soul by causing a message from\r\nhis grandfather to appear in red letters on his arm? The hit-or-miss\r\ncharacter of all these phenomena, the very silliness and stupidity\r\nwhich you find in the appeal, may be taken as evidence of the\r\nsincerity of the psychic.\"\r\n\r\nTo this Morton took exception. \"I don't see that. There has never been\r\na religion too gross, too fallacious, to fail of followers. Remember\r\nthe sacred bull of Egypt and the snake-dance of the Hopi. The whole\r\ntheory, as Spencer says, is a survival of a more primitive life and\r\nreligion.\"\r\n\r\nFinding himself alone with Weissmann during the afternoon, he said,\r\ncarelessly:\r\n\r\n\"If you were called upon to prove the falsity or demonstrate the truth\r\nof the spiritualistic faith--how would you set to work?\"\r\n\r\nWeissmann was a delicious picture as he stood facing his young\r\ncolleague. He was dressed to go home, and was topped by a low-crowned,\r\nbroad-brimmed, black hat, set rather far back on his head, and\r\nfloating like a shallop on the curling wave of his grizzled hair. His\r\neyebrows, gray, with two black tufts near the nose, resembled the\r\nantennæ of a moth. His loose coat, his baggy trousers, and a huge\r\numbrella finished the picture. He was a veritable German professor--a\r\nfigure worthy of _Die Fliegende Blätter_.\r\n\r\n\"I can't say exactly,\" he replied, thoughtfully. \"In general I would\r\nbring to bear as many senses as possible. I would see, I would hear, I\r\nwould touch. I would make electricity my watch-dog. I would make\r\nmatter my trap.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how?\"\r\n\r\n\"That, circumstances would determine. My plan would develop to fit the\r\ncases. I would begin with the simplest of the phenomena.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know Meyers's book?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah! No.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet they say it is a careful and scientific study.\"\r\n\r\n\"They say! Who say?\"\r\n\r\nServiss smiled. \"The spiritualists.\" Then lightly added: \"What would\r\nyou and the rest of the scientific world do to me if I should go into\r\nthis investigation and come out converted?\"\r\n\r\nThe old man's eyes twinkled and his mustache writhed in silent\r\nenjoyment. \"Burn you alive, as we did Bent and Zöllner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you would. What you really want me to do is to go in and\r\nsmash the whole thing, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Clarke, that crazy preacher, said we men of science were just as\r\ndogmatic in our way as the bishops, and I begin to think he's right.\r\nWe condemn without investigation--we play the heretic, just as they\r\ndid. Could you--could any man--go into this thing and not lose\r\nstanding among his fellows?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\" The old figure straightened, and his mustache bristled sternly.\r\n\"No; he who goes into this arena invites a kind of martyrdom--that is\r\nalso why I say you, a _young_ man--you might live to see your\r\nvindication, but I would die in my disgrace as Zöllner did.\"\r\n\r\nSo they parted, Serviss admiring his chief's blunt honesty and vast\r\nlearning, Weissmann busy with the thought that his eyes were failing,\r\nand his work nearly done, \"and so little accomplished,\" he sadly\r\nadded.\r\n\r\nKate met her brother at the door in a kind of fury. \"Something must be\r\ndone for that girl. I have had a perfectly nerve-racking time. We must\r\nget her out of that house before they drive her crazy.\"\r\n\r\nThe sincerity of her rage froze the smile on his face. \"Is it as bad\r\nas that?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is as bad as you can imagine. That man Clarke has some kind of\r\nbaneful influence over her. He seems able to control her by just\r\nwaving his hand at her. And the mother is such a dear old silly--she\r\ntrusts to him completely. But go and dress and we will talk it all\r\nover. I'm all of a-tremble yet with what I've seen. I feel as if I had\r\nbeen to an insane asylum and witnessed a strangling.\"\r\n\r\nHe went away to his room, deeply perturbed, resentful of all this\r\nill-regulated human nature which could so upset his sane sister and\r\ncome between his own mind and his work. He believed in orderly and\r\nhumorous human life. Why should this teasing, tormenting girl from the\r\nmountains come with her trances and tricks to make life furious and\r\nantic where it had been amusing and accountable? To what would a\r\ncloser acquaintance lead? What would become of his studies if he gave\r\nhimself to her case? \"To disillusionment, I sincerely hope,\" he said.\r\n\r\nAs he joined his sister at dinner, he began, \"Well, now, sis, I'll\r\nlisten.\"\r\n\r\nKate had lost a little of her excitement under the influence of her\r\ntoilet-table, but she was still tense and flushed, as she hesitated,\r\nher heart overflowing with sisterly admiration, so handsome, so\r\nstrong, and so very established did Morton appear at the moment. His\r\ntone still further calmed and reassured her, and she began:\r\n\r\n\"In the first place, I like the girl very much; she is very pretty and\r\nmuch more _au fait_ than you had led me to suppose. Her manner is\r\nextremely good. The mother is dear and sweet, but deluded. Clarke and\r\nthat old man Pratt ought to be in an asylum--or the calaboose.\"\r\n\r\nMorton laughed harshly. \"Your succinct statement puts me in complete\r\npossession of the case. They're all fakirs together.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I didn't mean that. They're all fanatics. You should see the\r\nspirit-paintings and the slate-writings in that house! It was like a\r\njourney to a far country. Really, Morton, it staggers belief to think\r\nthat within twenty blocks of where we sit such a man and such a home\r\ncan exist. They _do_ exist, and it only makes me realize how small a\r\npart of the city we know, after all. And some things I heard there\r\nto-day make me wonder if science _isn't_ shutting its eyes--as these\r\npeople say--to a world right under its nose. Morton, those people\r\n_believe_ what they talk. That girl is honest; she may be\r\nself-deceived, but her sufferings are real. I can't believe that she\r\nis wicked.\"\r\n\r\n\"Weissmann practically advised me to go into a study of these morbid\r\nconditions.\"\r\n\r\n\"He did? Well, that from Rudolph Weissmann, after what I've _seen_\r\nto-day, unsettles my reason. Maybe those people really have a message.\r\nBut, Morton, you really must do something for that girl. Her condition\r\nis pitiful. One of the plans of that lunatic Clarke is to issue a\r\nchallenge to the world of science and to throw that girl into the\r\narena for you scientists to tear.\"\r\n\r\nMorton started--stared. \"No! Not a public challenge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it pitiful? Yes, he's going to speak on the second of next\r\nmonth at the Spirit Temple, and he's going to publicly describe\r\nViola's powers, and, as her manager, challenge the world to prove her\r\nfalse.\"\r\n\r\nAs Morton's mind flashed over the consequences of this challenge, his\r\nface paled. \"Good God, what an ordeal! But the girl, does she\r\nconsent?\"\r\n\r\n\"She does and she doesn't. As a sweet, nice child she shrinks from it;\r\nbut as a 'psychic,' as they call her, she has no choice. These inner\r\nforces seem able to take her by the throat any minute. They seized\r\nher while I was there. Morton, she impersonated Aunt Dosia, and\r\ndelivered the most vindictive message--she scared me blue. You never\r\nsaw anything more dramatic--more awful.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was the message?\"\r\n\r\n\"Something about a debt she wanted us to pay. She was furious about\r\nit. I don't know of any debt; do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. How did the message come?\"\r\n\r\nAs Kate described it, the impersonation grew grotesque, lost much of\r\nits power to horrify, and Morton, though he writhed at thought of the\r\ngirl's depravity, blamed the mother and Clarke for it. Kate made end\r\nby saying: \"It _was_ horrible to see, and it startled me. Then the\r\nother messages, those written ones, came through her hand--\"\r\n\r\n\"Automatic writing, they call it. That has no value--none whatever.\r\nThe whole programme was arranged for your benefit.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it wasn't. The girl was carried out of herself. She is somehow\r\nenslaved by Clarke, and she wants help. She wants to be investigated;\r\nbut she wants it done privately. She wants you to do it. She begs you\r\nto do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Begs me?\" His eyebrows lifted.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, she passionately desires your advice. The poor thing made an\r\nappeal that would have touched your heart. She wants to be cured of\r\nthis horrid thing--whatever it is. She wants to escape from Pratt and\r\nClarke and all the rest of those queer people. You must take it up,\r\nMorton. _You_ must make up a committee and take charge of her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Clarke is mad. No reputable man of science will go on such a\r\ncommittee. The girl will fall into the hands of notoriety-seekers--men\r\nof position do not meddle with such questions.\"\r\n\r\nKate flared forth. \"Why don't they? It is their duty just as much as\r\nit is Viola's duty to offer herself. That is where I lose patience\r\nwith you men of science. Why _don't_ you meet these people half-way?\r\nWomen wouldn't be such bigots--such cowards. If you don't help this\r\npoor girl I'll consider you a bigot and coward with the rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your whole position is most feminine,\" said Morton, arguing as much\r\nagainst himself as against Kate. \"You've only seen this girl once--you\r\nhave witnessed only one of her performances, and yet you are ready to\r\nchampion her before the world. I wish you'd tell me how you arrived at\r\na conviction of her honesty. Think of it! She assumes to be the\r\nmouth-piece of the dead. The very assumption is a discredit.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care; she has good, honest, sweet eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I bow to the force of the eyes, but over against her claim I put the\r\ndenials of science. The phenomena these fanatics base their hopes upon\r\nscience has already proven to be tricks, illusions, deceits.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care, her story, her own attitude towards the thing,\r\nconvinced me that she is _honest_.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the rogue who looks like a gentleman who runs the longest race.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" ended Kate, rather helplessly, \"see her--see her before you\r\ncondemn her.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I _have_ seen her--I've spent more days in her company than you\r\nhave hours.\"\r\n\r\nKate looked at him with new interest. \"You didn't tell me that before.\r\nYou said you'd met her casually.\"\r\n\r\n\"She is enormously interesting, but\"--his voice changed to earnest\r\nprotest--\"but, Kate, the thing the girl claims to be is out of key\r\nwith all organized human knowledge. It is a survival of the past. It\r\nbelongs to a world of dreams and portents. It is of a piece with the\r\nold crone's tales, fortune-telling, palmistry, and all the rest of the\r\nhodge-podge or hocus-pocus which makes up the world of the unlearned.\r\nI've given a great deal of thought to her fate. My heart bleeds for\r\nher, but what can I do? She really needs the care of a great\r\nphysician, like Tolman. She should be snatched from her unwholesome\r\nsurroundings and sent away to Europe or back to her hills. When I saw\r\nher last she was as sweet and blithe as a bobolink--we were on the\r\ntrail together, so far above the miasma of humankind that her girlhood\r\nseemed uncontaminated by any death-affrighted soul. Why don't she go\r\nback? She is vigorous and experienced in travel. Her step-father is\r\nnot poor; he is rich. Why don't she pull away and go back to her\r\nvalley?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what a 'control' is?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe that is the name they give the particular spirits which\r\nassume to advise and guide a medium. Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that poor thing is in mortal terror of her 'control,' who is\r\nher grandfather. She was quite defiant till Clarke reminded her that\r\nher guide would cut her down in her tracks if she refused. Then she\r\nwilted--went right off into death-like sleep. It was pitiful to see\r\nher. Clarke was terrible when he said it--he is a regular Svengali, I\r\nbelieve, and the mother is completely dominated by him. One of the\r\nspooks is her own father, the other her first husband. It seems that\r\nthey are willing to sacrifice the girl to _their_ science, for it\r\nseems they are leagued to dig a hole through to us from their side,\r\nand Viola is their avenue of communication. Then, too, the girl\r\nbelieves in it all. She rebels at times, but she has been having these\r\ntrances ever since she was ten years old.\" As the memory of the\r\nmother's tale freshened, Kate changed her tone. \"You needn't tell me,\r\nMorton Serviss, that these people are frauds. They may be mistaken,\r\nbut they're horribly in earnest. They believe in those spirits as you\r\ndo in germs, and Viola is absolutely helpless in their hands, if you\r\ncan say they have hands. They can throw her into a trance at any\r\nmoment. They've made her life a misery. She is absolutely enslaved to\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"That, too, could be a delusion--medical science is full of cases of\r\nauto-hypnotism.\"\r\n\r\n\"Viola Lambert is not a medical case. It's astonishing what a\r\nblooming beauty she is in the midst of it all. In fact, her health\r\ngives Clarke and the mother an argument--they say 'it hasn't hurt her,\r\nyou see.' But what future has the poor girl? Think of going through\r\nlife in that way!\"\r\n\r\nMorton's eyes were sad as he said: \"Her future is a dark one, from our\r\npoint of view, but she may be earning a crown to be given in the land\r\nof shadows. She is beautiful, but it is the beauty of a blighted\r\nflower.\"\r\n\r\nKate regarded him with affectionate eyes. \"I don't wonder that she has\r\nbewitched you, Morton. She can never be anything to you, of course.\r\nBut we must help her, just the same, and I confess I am crazy to see\r\none of her 'performances,' as you call them.\" Her face lightened. \"How\r\nwould it do to invite them to dinner and have a séance afterwards? You\r\ncould judge then of her truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sacrifice her to make _our_ holiday, eh? Kate, I thought better of\r\nyou than that. Isn't that precisely the poor girl's complaint that\r\neverybody wants to use her as a sort of telephone connection with the\r\nother world? No. If you invite her here, receive her as a lady, not as\r\na pervert. But, now, let us see. You say Clarke is going to issue his\r\nchallenge soon?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the second.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that she has consented?\"\r\n\r\n\"Consented? Poor thing, she has no choice.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he issues that challenge, she is lost.\" His brows knitted. \"To\r\ndefy the world of science in that way will make her fair game for\r\nevery charlatan in the city. The press will unite to destroy her. I\r\nwill see Clarke and Pratt myself. For the sake of their own cause they\r\nmust not enter on such a foolish plan. Unless this life has already\r\neaten deep into the essential purity of the girl's nature, she will be\r\ncorrupted. This public-test business will drive her into all kinds of\r\nartifices and shifts. Her exposure will be swift and sure. Yes, I will\r\nsee Clarke. If necessary I will undertake to secure a purely private\r\ninvestigation of her claims--\"\r\n\r\nKate rose and came round to his chair. \"Will you? Oh, that will be\r\ngood of you, Mort. I can't begin to tell you how that girl's face has\r\nworked on me to-day. I feel that it would be criminal in you not to do\r\nsomething when she expects it of you. She looks to us to save her. She\r\npassionately desires your help. Go over there to-morrow. Don't delay;\r\nthey may issue that challenge any minute. Clarke was angry and alarmed\r\nat my attitude, and may send out the notice to-night. Do go, Morton.\r\nYou can't afford to stand on ceremony when a soul is in danger.\"\r\n\r\nHe rose. \"Very well, I will go; but I never embarked on an enterprise\r\nthat seemed more dangerous, more futile. My heart says go, but my\r\nreason is against it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Follow your heart in this instance.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I did that wholly, I would go straight to this dragon's den and\r\nsnatch the fair maiden home to my castle.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would be romantic, but a little too daring, even for my\r\nenthusiasm.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may be reassured. No one really follows the heart in these\r\ndays--at least, those who do land in jail Of the almshouse.\"\r\n\r\nAs he lit his cigar he observed that his hand trembled. For the first\r\ntime in his life his nerves were over-charged and leaping with\r\nexcitement just above control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nTHE SLEEPING SIBYL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following evening, after much debate with himself, Serviss,\r\narmored in scientific reflection, set forth towards the unknown\r\ncountry wherefrom his sister had brought report of a maiden dwelling\r\nin the power of giants, pitiably ensnared by evil-minded enchanters.\r\nThe errand, in Kate's mind, was as chivalric as any of the olden time,\r\nbut the knight's progress was lit by the green and red lamps of trade,\r\nand threaded only the brazen jungles of traffic. For dragons he had\r\nbut the overhead monsters of iron and brass--monsters too intent on\r\ntheir own mad game to take account of such small deer as this footman\r\npicking his road beneath. It was half-past eight of the night-watch.\r\n\r\nServiss began to realize that his reawakened interest in this girl was\r\nnot purely impersonal and scientific. It had become, indeed, a most\r\ndisquieting, intimate concern, and every step towards the West\r\nsharpened the sense of his folly. Had it not been for the memory of\r\nthat ride up the mountains--his keen remembrance of that day of joyous\r\nyouth--he could have easily dismissed Viola's case from his mind; but\r\nas he permitted himself to dwell upon her rosy, rain-wet face, her\r\nbird-like ecstasy of voice, her splendid defiance of the sun and wind,\r\na desire that was as fierce as anger actuated him, making his proffer\r\nof aid not a gallantry but a duty. \"I will defend her from herself.\r\nThough a liar, she is still worth redemption. In a certain sense the\r\ndespicable rôle she is playing has been forced upon her.\"\r\n\r\nAs he mounted Simeon's steps he observed that awnings covered the\r\nadjacent carriage-block, and that some young people, all in party\r\ndress, were entering--a merry, chattering group--whereas the Pratt\r\nmansion towered gloomily, unlighted, unalluring as a prison.\r\n\r\nHe was about to touch the bell when the door opened and a porter\r\nsoftly greeted him. \"The meeting has begun, sir. Step right in, sir.\r\nThis way, sir. Softly, please.\"\r\n\r\nBefore he was fairly aware of his attendant's meaning Serviss found\r\nhimself thrust through a heavily curtained archway into a large room\r\ndimly lighted by a single lamp at the farther end. It contained about\r\ntwenty people, and he hesitated in embarrassment and some amazement at\r\nthe threshold.\r\n\r\nBeneath the light, on a reclining-chair, lay a woman with closed eyes\r\nand folded hands. Beside this figure stood Clarke in the midst of an\r\naddress, every word of which was made dramatically effective by a\r\nforced calmness, an elocutionary trick.\r\n\r\n\"Some of you, my friends, may never have seen any of these mysterious\r\nthings. So many people say to me, 'Nothing supernatural ever happens\r\nwhere I am.' To you I repeat my answer to them. Have you ever tried\r\nto enter the right conditions? Here is a caravan of Arabs on the\r\ndesert. The road, hard-beaten, is wide and dusty, the necks of the\r\ncamels sway, the drivers shout, there is the smell of sweat, of\r\nleather, of oil. The alkaline dust blinds and blisters. Physical\r\nweariness and suffering shut out all else. This is no place to look\r\nfor heavenly visitors. You would be a fool to expect a demonstration\r\nthere. But at night when the beasts are at rest, when the cool, starry\r\nsky bends close, when the tent-flaps are closed, then the old men sit\r\nabout and commune with their dead--as all primitive, natural peoples\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n\"So with you. You say to me, 'I have no heavenly visions in my life.'\r\nI answer: Do you expect them on Broadway or in your business office?\r\nYou are on the dusty, weedy, noisy high-road, my friends, and you will\r\nnever hear a spirit voice or catch the flutter of a hand till you\r\nretire to the dusk and the quiet. Enter the land of meditation.\r\nManifest a willingness to meet the angel visitors half-way, and then\r\nthe wings of the unseen will rustle about you, the cool and scented\r\nwinds of the invisible universe will kiss your cheeks. Shadowy voices\r\nwill be wafted from the dark. Song will break from the silences to\r\ncomfort and heal you.\r\n\r\n\"We see only what we _will_ to see--that is a known law of psychology.\r\nElectricity was a force in the world six thousand years before man\r\nreally saw it. Now we hear it crackle in our hair and stir in our\r\ngarments. By studying the conditions of its manifestation we are able\r\nto call it forth in giant power. So of these invisible ones--they are\r\nall about us, eager to bless, to prove their presence. They are here\r\nnow. Around each one of you there are throngs hovering to manifest\r\ntheir love; they will do so, by the aid of this wonderful psychic who\r\nhas consented to sit for us to-night. Let me repeat that she does this\r\nbecause the dead demand and the living beseech her to act as their\r\nintermediary.\" With abrupt, almost ludicrous change to a\r\nmatter-of-fact tone, he added, \"Henry, turn the light a little lower.\"\r\n\r\nAs the attendant glided to his task, Serviss was mightily moved to\r\nrise in his seat and cry out against the foolish, profaning business.\r\nThey were putting the girl into the exact attitude of the paid\r\ntrickster. At college he had attended a few of these séances, where\r\nvulgar and immoral women had furthered their trade; and to see Viola,\r\nwhom he still believed to be essentially sweet, or at least\r\nreclaimable, thrown into this most dubious posture, disgusted and\r\nangered him. \"But I am an uninvited guest. My rising would precipitate\r\na scene, involving Viola,\" he reasoned, and so kept his seat, though\r\nhis hands clinched and his teeth set with the effort at control.\r\n\r\nSome one commenced to play softly upon a harp, and a little sigh like\r\na breeze passed over the group. The women had begun to respond to the\r\nmanager's emotional appeal. \"I can feel them gathering,\" he called,\r\nsoftly, from his seat beside the motionless girl. \"The spirit host\r\nare about us. I can almost hear the rustle of their wings.\"\r\n\r\nThe harpist stopped abruptly, and an echoing strain of faint music\r\ncontinued to sound, seemingly from the ceiling--a fairy harp\r\nexquisitely clear. \"That is my Adele,\" announced Clarke, in a voice so\r\nconvincing in its tone of satisfied longing that the women of his\r\naudience again rustled with ecstasy.\r\n\r\n\"I think he is beautiful!\" exclaimed one.\r\n\r\n\"A voice is whispering to me,\" Clarke continued. \"It is asking for\r\nsome one--I cannot quite make out. Who is it? Again, please. Morton\r\nServiss?\" His voice rose in surprise. \"He is not here. You are surely\r\nmistaken. Certainly, I will ask. Is Professor Serviss here?\"\r\n\r\nServiss replied, with a slight note of annoyance in his voice, \"Yes, I\r\nam here.\"\r\n\r\nAgain the little group shivered with excitement--not because they were\r\nacquainted with the name and fame of the scientist, but because they\r\nanticipated some especially wonderful manifestation of the psychic's\r\npower. Serviss, irritated and puzzled, waited in silence.\r\n\r\nClarke's voice trembled with his effort to appear calm as he said:\r\n\"Professor Serviss, I am glad to welcome you. Won't you please come\r\nforward? The 'control' desires it.\"\r\n\r\nFor a full minute, in dead silence, Serviss debated the matter, then\r\nrose to comply. Mrs. Lambert met him with cordial hand, saying, in a\r\nwhisper: \"We did not know you were coming; but they knew. They want\r\nyou closer to the manifestation.\"\r\n\r\nHe, sick at heart at her connivance in the trick, made no reply, but\r\nsilently took the seat which Clarke indicated.\r\n\r\nViola lay as silent as a statue, her face faintly showing, a diamond\r\nin her corsage emitting a momentary gleam as she breathed tranquilly\r\nat long intervals. There was nothing of the professional sibyl in her\r\ndress, and her tall figure was very beautiful in this attitude of deep\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nClarke, mindful of effect, made explanation: \"Professor Serviss, as\r\nmany of you know, is renowned in science, and the 'controls' are\r\nespecially anxious that he shall have the best possible opportunity to\r\nhear and see. Will you play again, Mrs. Robinson?\"\r\n\r\nAs the harp resumed its sadly sweet pulsations, the dead matter in the\r\nroom seemed to awake. Cracklings, snappings, as of a fire-log, arose\r\nfrom the carpet. Rappings resounded from the walls. The piano began to\r\nthrill as if a roguish child were thumping it.\r\n\r\n\"That's my little boy,\" whispered Mrs. Lambert.\r\n\r\nClarke shut off the light above his head till it was but a faint point\r\nof yellow light, and then a hand, firm and broad, was laid for an\r\ninstant on Serviss's shoulder. Stars of phosphorescent fire floated\r\nabout. A small hand fluttered in a caress about the face of the\r\nsleeping girl.\r\n\r\n\"That is her father's hand,\" again murmured Mrs. Lambert.\r\n\r\nServiss was willing to believe the girl's trance real, and that she\r\nhad no part in the hocus-pocus up to this point; but even as he leaned\r\nforward to peer into the faintly visible face of the sleeper a voice,\r\nbreathy yet metallic, as though coming through the horn of a\r\nphonograph, sounded in his ear. \"Be not so doubting, my boy. I, too,\r\ndoubted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Loggy,\" answered the voice, with a chuckle.\r\n\r\nThis answer, so unexpected, this chuckle, so familiar, startled him,\r\nfor it was his pet name for an uncle, a professor of mathematics who\r\nused to call himself \"Old Logarithms\" when in play with his nephews;\r\nbut, before Serviss had time to put out his hand, the horn came down\r\nsoftly on his head, then withdrew, and a boyish voice laughed in his\r\near, \"You're a dunce!\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lambert bent towards him. \"Did some dear one speak to you? I hope\r\nso. We are so anxious to have you one of us.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not reply, for a third voice, seemingly that of an old man, was\r\nissuing from the horn in pompous, stolid, old-fashioned utterance.\r\n\"The reality of all you see, young man, can be proven. Set yourself to\r\nthe grand task of destroying all fear of the change men call death.\r\nScience is hopeless. We alone can save the world from despair.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is my father,\" explained Mrs. Lambert, \"he is my daughter's\r\nchief 'control,' He cares for her--teaches her.\"\r\n\r\nAgain the floating horn passed Morton's face, and a boyish voice\r\ncalled, \"Mamma, are you happy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear, when you are with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"We're always with you. We're glad P'ofessor Serviss came.\"\r\n\r\n\"So are we, Waltie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Papa says, 'Tell him to watch--tell him--to be patient--'\" The voice\r\nhesitated, murmured, and was silent, then added, plaintively: \"Oh,\r\ndear, there are so many who want to talk--they take my strength away.\r\nGood-bye.\"\r\n\r\nThe horn dropped with a clang, but was at once caught up and floated\r\naway over the circle. Dear names were whispered, secrets recalled.\r\nLoved voices, long stilled by the grave, were heard again. Hands that\r\nthe earth had covered touched tear-wet cheeks, and with these caresses\r\nsobbing outcries burst from the women.\r\n\r\n\"I believe. Yes, yes! I know you, darling,\" called a man's voice, and\r\nhis accent was more moving than the cries of the women.\r\n\r\nPratt, in wistful accents, asked, \"Is there no one for me to-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, father,\" answered a girl's voice from the megaphone, now hanging\r\nalmost directly in front of Serviss, \"we are all here. I'm going to\r\nsing for you--the song you liked the best.\"\r\n\r\nThis she did in a far-away voice, sweetly and with excellent\r\nvocalization, but the first notes startled Serviss. They were from\r\n\"The Banks of Loch Lomond,\" the very song Clarke sang to Viola's\r\naccompaniment that night in the little cabin in Colorow. \"And yet she\r\ntold me she had no voice!\" he said to himself, and a bitter heat\r\novercame the chill of his disgust, \"What unconscionable trickery!\"\r\nThis last piece of deception seemed to involve the girl more directly\r\nthan any other of the evening's accursed jugglery.\r\n\r\nPratt was pleading, brokenly: \"My old paw is open, Jennie; put your\r\nhand in it--just for a moment--as you used to. I'm so lonely without\r\nyou. Girls, can't you touch your old father? Give me a kiss--and\r\nmother, is she with you to-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we're all here. I can't kiss you to-night, father; sometime I\r\nwill,\" the gentle voice replied. \"I'm not strong enough to-night.\"\r\nThere was infinite regret in the tone, which conveyed to Serviss, with\r\nsingular vividness, a virginal charm, united to something very sweet,\r\nalmost saintly. Every sentiment had been beautifully voiced--no\r\nactress could have done it better.\r\n\r\nClarke spoke gently, solemnly: \"Professor Serviss, will you now take a\r\nseat beside the psychic. Her 'controls' wish to make some special\r\ndemonstration for you.\"\r\n\r\nWith reluctance and loathing, the young scientist moved forward,\r\nguided by the mother, and placed his seat at the right side of Viola,\r\nwhose daintily robed, graceful figure he could still detect. Her\r\nwrists appeared to be lying on the broad arms of her reclining-chair\r\nand her head was turned away from him. She seemed very feminine, very\r\nlovely, and very helpless, and he had a definite and powerful desire\r\nto take her in his arms, to wake her, to snatch her from this most\r\nrevolting drama of the dark.\r\n\r\nHe was now seated directly between the sibyl and Clarke, her manager,\r\nand every sense was keenly awake. A tapping, metallic sound at once\r\narose either upon his chair or Viola's, and the horn, or whatever it\r\nwas, floated dimly into view, then vanished, and a moment later the\r\nvoice of the chief \"control\" entered his right ear: \"Man of science,\r\ndo not shirk your duty. Here now we offer you a chance to solve the\r\ngreat mystery. Will you accept?\"\r\n\r\nTo this he made no answer, for his widely opened eyes were strained in\r\nthe effort to locate Viola's hands, eager to determine her part in the\r\nphenomena, and as the moving megaphone again touched his right temple\r\nhe laid a quick hand lightly on her white wrist.\r\n\r\nShe leaped convulsively with a gasping cry, the horn tumbled to the\r\nfloor with prodigious clatter, and the women all shrieked and rose to\r\ntheir feet.\r\n\r\n\"Fool! What have you done?\" cried Clarke, in a terrible voice.\r\n\r\nServiss's tone expressed only contempt as he answered, \"No great harm,\r\nI think.\"\r\n\r\nThe clergyman pushed him aside rudely, and knelt beside the girl, who\r\nwas writhing and moaning in her chair, as though contorted with pain.\r\n\r\nWords of indignation arose from the circle, and one or two shouted,\r\n\"Run him out! He has no business here.\" But Clarke cried out, in a\r\ncommanding voice: \"Remain where you are, friends! Be quiet for a few\r\nminutes.\" They obeyed, and Serviss was about to withdraw when Pratt\r\nconfronted him. \"What do you mean? Do you want to kill the psychic?\"\r\n\r\nThe mother was bending above her daughter with soothing words. \"There,\r\nthere, dearie! It will soon pass. You may turn on the light, Anthony.\"\r\n\r\nClarke turned the cock of the burner till a faint glow revealed the\r\ngirl, white, suffering, her left side convulsed. \"You can't do things\r\nlike that,\" he went on, addressing himself to Serviss. \"In these\r\ntrances the nervous system is in a state of enormous tension. The\r\npsychic must not be mishandled.\"\r\n\r\n\"I merely touched her arm,\" answered Serviss, quietly.\r\n\r\nThe mother answered: \"The lightest touch is sufficient to convulse\r\nher, professor. You should have asked permission of the 'control,'\r\nthen it would not have shocked her.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope it has done no lasting harm.\" His voice, in spite of himself,\r\ntook on sympathy, though he believed the girl's shock to have been\r\ngrossly exaggerated for some reason of her own. \"I thought I was\r\ninvited to make the test.\"\r\n\r\nThe mother's calm voice was thrilling as she said: \"She's better now.\r\nYou may turn the light on full.\"\r\n\r\nViola was a most appealing figure as she bloomed from the dark, pure\r\nand pale as a lily. She was dressed exquisitely in white, and seemed\r\nolder, more worldly wise, and more bewitching than when he had last\r\nseen her; but with a feeling of profound contempt and bitterness\r\nServiss shrank from meeting her gaze. He slipped away into the hall\r\nand out of the house--back into the cool, crisp air of the night,\r\nashamed of himself for having yielded again to the girl's disturbing\r\nlure, burning with disappointment, and sad and grieving over the loss\r\nof his last shred of respect for her.\r\n\r\n\"Britt was right,\" he exclaimed, drawing a deep breath as if to free\r\nhis lungs of the foul air of deceit. \"They are all frauds together,\"\r\nand with this decision came a sense of relief as well as of loss.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: \"'WHAT DO YOU MEAN? DO YOU WANT TO KILL THE\r\n   PSYCHIC?'\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nKATE'S INTERROGATION\r\n\r\n\r\nKate, waiting impatiently in her turn, met him at the door. \"Well, did\r\nyou see her? What did she say?\" Her voice rose in excitement, for she\r\nperceived unusual gravity in the lines of his face.\r\n\r\n\"Your 'far country' lies on the borders of hell,\" he replied, with\r\ndisconcerting succinctness. \"Yes, I saw her--or, rather, the ruin of\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\nShe recoiled before this tone. \"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\nHe shook himself free of his coat. \"She has descended swiftly. She now\r\nlends herself to the shallowest, basest trickery.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe it. What has happened to make you so bitter?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will tell you presently,\" he replied, hanging up his hat with\r\naggravating deliberation. \"But not here. Come to the library.\" He led\r\nthe way and she followed quite meekly, for she perceived in him\r\nsomething new and harsh. She sat quite still while he filled his pipe\r\nand lit it, waited until the soothing flow of smoke through its stem\r\nhad softened his face. He began, sadly: \"The girl has gone beyond our\r\ninterference, Kate; and if she weren't so pretty, if I hadn't seen\r\nher when she was wholesome and altogether charming, I would not have\r\nwasted this evening on her. To-night's doings were unforgivable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did she give you a sitting?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but they were in the midst of a _séance_\"--he spoke this word\r\nwith infinite disgust--\"and the usher, mistaking me for an invited\r\nguest, thrust me into the very centre of the circle.\"\r\n\r\n\"How lucky! I wish I had been there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's as you look at it. When I realized what was going on I\r\nwanted to leave, and, I repeat, had the chief actress been an old hag\r\nor the usual sloven who plays this game, I would have fled; but she\r\nwas as beautiful as a statue as she lay there, professedly in deep\r\ntrance.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're sure it was Viola?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish there were a doubt! Yes, she was there, surrounded by a group\r\nof Pratt's friends, giving a _performance_.\" This word, too, expressed\r\nhis contempt, his pain. \"She went the whole length--lent herself to\r\nthe cheapest kind of jugglery, playing with horrible adroitness upon\r\nthe emotions of a lot of bereaved men and women. It was revolting,\r\nKate. It shakes one's faith in humanity to see such a girl in such a\r\nposition--and that nice-appearing old mother sat there serene as a\r\ntabby-cat while her daughter bamboozled a dozen open-faced ninnies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me exactly what happened; I can't share your horror till I know\r\nwhat the girl actually did.\"\r\n\r\nHe approached the details with a grimace.\r\n\r\n\"First of all, imagine a little half-circle of well-dressed men and\r\nwomen, in a big drawing-room, enclosing a girl lying on a low chair\r\nunder a single gas-jet, and a man standing beside her speechifying.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was Clarke, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course. Then imagine the light turned down, and the usual floating\r\nguitar--in the dark, of course--and rappings and whispers and the\r\ntouch of hands--all in the dark. Then imagine--this will make you\r\nlaugh--some kind of horn or megaphone of tin, that rambled around\r\ninvisibly, distributing voices of loved ones here and there like\r\nsweetmeats out of a cornucopia--\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean the spirits _spoke_ through that thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what they all believed.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you don't think the girl--\"\r\n\r\n\"Who else? Some of the voices were women's and one or two were\r\nchildren's. Clarke couldn't do the children's voices.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't believe it of her! Clarke must have done them. He's capable\r\nof anything, but I don't, I won't believe such baseness of that girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"It hurts me to admit it, Kate, but I am forced to believe that she\r\nnot only sang through that horn to-night, but that she lied to me. She\r\ntold me once that she had no voice, and yet 'by request' she sang into\r\nthat horn, and very sweetly, too, the very song to which she played an\r\naccompaniment when Clarke and I met for the first time. The effrontery\r\nof it was confounding.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe there was a confederate.\"\r\n\r\n\"That doesn't sweeten the mess very much.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, and yet it wouldn't be quite so bad. But go on--what else?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I was invited by the 'controls'--so Clarke said--to come up and\r\nsit beside the medium, which I did, very loathly. It gave me a keen\r\npang to look down on that lovely creature pretending to sleep, knowing\r\nperfectly well that she was planning some deep deception.\"\r\n\r\n\"You _are_ bitter. What next?\"\r\n\r\n\"I took a seat beside her, determined to see if she really had a hand\r\nin the deception. I thought I could prevent anything happening.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Everything went on quite as briskly as before, and all the while\r\nI thought I could see her arms lying limp along her chair--lovely arms\r\nthey were, too. She isn't poor, you must understand that, Kate; and\r\nthat really makes the crime worse, for she has not the usual\r\nexcuse--she is not doing it for her daily bread.\"\r\n\r\nKate sat like a judge, \"Go on. You seized her, of course?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; just when the cone was emitting an old man's pompous harangue I\r\nlaid my hand on her arm. The horn dropped, the circle rose in\r\nconfusion, and I came away.\"\r\n\r\n\"I expected you'd do that. All sceptics do, I believe. But I want to\r\nknow _all_ that took place. You're so concise. You say the cone\r\nemitted a man's voice. Now, how could--\"\r\n\r\n\"It produced the _impression_ of a man's voice. It is easy to deceive\r\nunder such conditions. The cone was passed from her hand to Clarke's\r\nat the proper moments, and, as you say, there might have been a\r\nchild--\"\r\n\r\n\"You must not infer, Mort--my faith in that girl is at stake. Was\r\nthere nothing in her favor? Nothing that justified her claim?\"\r\n\r\nHe hesitated and Kate leaned forward in excess of interest. \"Go on,\r\nMorton, be honest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, as I think of it there was one little thing which was\r\nrather curious. I don't know how she or Clarke or any one there should\r\nknow what we used to call Uncle Ben.\"\r\n\r\n\"What? Did you get a message from him?\"\r\n\r\n\"A voice from the megaphone asked for me, and when I requested the\r\nname of 'the party speaking,' as Clarke says, it replied with an oily\r\nchuckle, exactly like the old duffer, '_It's old Loggy._'\"\r\n\r\n\"It did?\" Her voice was sharp with surprise. \"Well, now, that is as\r\nwonderful as my experience. How do you account for _that_? How _do_\r\nyou account for such things?\" she repeated, insistently.\r\n\r\n\"Clarke must have known--\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense. No one outside our immediate family knows of that nickname.\r\nBesides, how would he know the way 'Loggy' laughed? I'd forgotten it\r\nmyself.\"\r\n\r\n\"So had I. But what would you say? Would you jump to the conclusion--\"\r\n\r\n\"_You_ are jumping at the conclusion, Mort. If there is one single\r\nthing that you can't understand, you must give that girl the benefit\r\nof the doubt. What did 'Loggy' say?\"\r\n\r\n\"There you go! You're ready to swallow the whole lump of humbuggery,\r\njust because there is one little puzzling plum in it.\"\r\n\r\nKate was not to be put down. \"What did uncle _say_?\"\r\n\r\nHe submitted. \"Nothing else. Like most of those dead folk, he was\r\nthere just to manifest, not to impart wisdom.\"\r\n\r\nKate leaned back in her chair and grew thoughtful. \"Morton, that was\r\nwonderful. No one knew you were coming, no one knew you except those\r\npeople, and they're from, the other end of the earth--and yet\r\n_somebody_ speaks, using a pet name we've both forgotten. Now, I call\r\nthat a most important thing to dwell upon. How can _you_, a scientist,\r\noverlook it?\"\r\n\r\n\"But you must remember all this happened in the house of jugglery.\r\nThere is no value in a performance of that kind. There was no test\r\napplied. Confederates had full opportunity to come and go. To have\r\nweight with me these wonders must take place under conditions of my\r\nmaking, not theirs.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what she wants.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe it. Pardon me, Kate, but you've been taken in.\r\nWhatever this girl was two years ago, she is now a part of Clarke's\r\nscheme, which is to secure a tremendous lot of advertising and\r\nthen--emit a book.\"\r\n\r\nKate transfixed him with a finger. \"Morton Serviss, there is nothing\r\nso convincing as a tone. I know that girl is honest--she may be\r\ndeceived, she may be made a tool of, unconsciously, by Clarke, but she\r\ndoes not wilfully deceive. I will not let you off with this\r\nexperience; you must see her in private--talk with her as I did.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will have nothing further to do with her or hers,\" he replied, with\r\ndetermined quiet, knocking the ashes from his pipe. \"I have other and\r\nbetter business in the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe it is better business. Now, wait a moment, I have\r\nsomething to tell of my own evening. While you were gone I 'phoned\r\nUncle Harrison and Aunt Nancy about that debt of my great-aunt--who\r\ncame to me through Viola to-day; they knew nothing about it, but they\r\nset to work looking over her old papers, and found that there was a\r\nsealed letter addressed to a doctor in Michigan, and in the letter was\r\na check made out to him and which she intended to send him. Now, what\r\ndo you think of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see that that has any necessary connection with your\r\nexperience this afternoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it does. I'm sure of it. Auntie felt grateful to this young\r\ndoctor and wanted to reward him. Morton, it was a big check!\" She\r\nuttered this impressively.\r\n\r\n\"Was it? How much?\"\r\n\r\n\"Five thousand dollars.\"\r\n\r\nHe faced her with a whistle of surprise. \"Well, well! that isn't so\r\namusing. Are we to pay it? Is that the idea?\"\r\n\r\n\"If I am sure--if the letter is what they 'phoned it to be, we've got\r\nto pay it, I'm her sole legatee, and she was very angry because it\r\nhadn't been paid; but that's not the really important part. How did\r\nViola Lambert know of that letter--and that check?\"\r\n\r\nHe was deeply impressed, and did not try to conceal it. \"That is very\r\npuzzling; but it may be a case of mind-reading, which, I believe, the\r\nmodern psychologists admit has been proved.\" He began to muse. \"It may\r\nbe, as Weissmann says, that there is always some basis for a claim\r\nsuch as Clarke makes for this girl. It may be that she has a faculty\r\nfor reading what lies in the brain of another--\"\r\n\r\n\"Morton Serviss, you shall not condemn that girl unheard. You have\r\ntaken Britt's word about her, and you've listened to my story, but you\r\nmust see her yourself and talk with her alone, so that she will be\r\nfree to tell you just how she feels.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I am going to bed and try to forget the whole disconcerting\r\ngroup.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the way with you scientists. You'll pursue the tail of a\r\ncomet--or a germ--till you're black in the face, but when something\r\nreally important to the human race comes under your nose you can't see\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're forceful but not elegant, sis.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm out of all patience with you.\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed. \"Good-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope that girl's face will haunt you,\" she replied.\r\n\r\nIt did. From the moment he turned off his light his mind leaped into\r\nthe most restless activity. Taking up the scroll of the night's\r\nevents, he read and reread it with minutest care. A voice seemed to\r\npresent the girl's case, arguing that she had no conscious part in the\r\nmanifestations. \"It is possible for one in deep trance to rise and\r\nmanipulate horns, bells, and guitars at the suggestion of another\r\nprecisely as a somnambulist walks without intention of wrong-doing,\r\nwithout conscious knowledge of what is being done. She might have had\r\na veritable hand in to-night's drama and still be innocent. Hypnotism\r\nis now pretty thoroughly proven--and to Clarke you must look for the\r\nreal offender.\r\n\r\n\"The human brain, which is marvellous enough when in health and\r\nsinging merrily forward like a cunningly constructed and jewelled\r\ntime-piece, becomes, in disease, as baffling, as hopeless of solution\r\nas the laws of the unfathomable sky. Beyond the utmost sweep of the\r\nimagined lies the marvel of fact. The beliefs, the vagaries, the\r\nhallucinations of the insane have never been co-ordinated, perhaps\r\nthey never will be. It is possible that this girl, so normal in\r\nappearance, has a rotten strand in her--some weakness inherited from\r\nher father. This is the only way in which to account for her glowing\r\nphysical health and her manifest mental disorder. She has her father's\r\nmind in a body drawn from her mother. One-half of her is pure and\r\nsweet and girlish, the other is old, decayed, lying, and\r\nirresponsible. Can she be reclaimed?\r\n\r\n\"It is now known that the conscious mind is but a pin's-point of the\r\nmind's activity, the conscious state being but one of an infinite number\r\nof possible states--that the submerged, unconscious self is a million\r\ntimes more complex than the chain of those conscious states which makes\r\nup the normal or orderly life of an individual. May it not be that this\r\ngirl, by reason of her long practice of submission--induced by\r\nothers--has dethroned her conscious, higher self, making of her\r\nsubliminal self a tyrant? This submerged self, holding, as it does, all\r\nthe experiences of the dark past, all the lusts, deceits, and\r\nsubterfuges, all the cruelties and shameless potentialities of her\r\nanimal and semicivilized forebears, and being but a mass of discordant\r\nimpulses--states almost entirely disassociated from her conscious\r\nlife--has all but taken possession of her higher self. The restraint of\r\nthe later-developed, governing, moral self being weakened, the witches\r\nand wolves are leaping forth to vex and destroy. Over this fortuitous\r\nsubversion of her soul's kingdom Clarke now rules like a demon\r\ncouncillor.\r\n\r\n\"Considered in the light of a study in morbid psychology, her case is\r\nenthralling. From the standpoint of human pity this use of her is a\r\ndiabolical outrage. Suppose Kate to be right--suppose the girl has\r\nawakened to a full realization of her danger? Suppose that her cry for\r\nsuccor is real, can I, can any man who hears it, refuse to heed?\r\nWould I ever sleep in peace again?\"\r\n\r\nHe went further, he admitted that her beauty was the deciding element.\r\n\"She is too lovely to be left to a fanatic's designs. She has matured\r\nin body, grown more womanly, since we rode the trail together; may it\r\nnot be that her mind, maturing even more rapidly, has come to perceive\r\nthe crumbling edge of the abyss before it stands and turns to science\r\nas the only rescuer? No matter what her past deceptions have been, is\r\nit not my duty to help her?\"\r\n\r\nHis anger and contempt dissolved into compassion. He recalled her\r\nyouth, her inexperience. \"I will at least see her again,\" he decided,\r\ndeep in the night. \"I will talk with her. I will draw her out. I will\r\nstudy her. All will depend upon her attitude towards me and towards\r\nher own soul.\" And in that softened mood sleep came to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nVIOLA'S PLEA FOR HELP\r\n\r\n\r\nMorton went to his work next morning quite unfitted for an especially\r\ndelicate piece of dissection which he had in hand. He bungled it, and\r\nWeissmann transfixed him with a glare of disapproval. \"My boy, these\r\nsocial gayeties do not consort well with science.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man smiled to think how wide of the mark his chief was. He\r\nheld up both hands. \"I swear, it shall not happen again.\" Then, moved\r\nby a desire to secure a comment on the curious phenomena of the\r\nséance, he related the story of his brief interview with his uncle\r\nBen's ghost. \"Now, do you suppose that Clarke, or the 'medium,' could\r\ndig around among the dusty, forgotten lumber of my mind and get hold\r\nof a queer fact like that nickname?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why go so far round?\" inquired Weissmann. \"Why not say it was your\r\nuncle Ben who spoke?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are joking.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am _not_ joking. If the facts are as you say, then one explanation\r\nis as reasonable as the other.\"\r\n\r\nServiss was amazed. \"You don't really mean it!\"\r\n\r\n\"If you say it was an illusion of the sense of hearing, I agree; but\r\ndo we not stagger among illusions? Who so well as we know the\r\nillusory nature of every fact? Nothing is stable under our hands. Of\r\nwhat avail to reduce the universe to one substance, as the monists do?\r\nWe pry, we peer into that substance--it fades like smoke. Forty years\r\nI have probed among the cells of the body--the final mystery remains\r\ninsoluble. Why? Because the atom, the thing once demonstrated 'the\r\nfinal division of matter,' is itself an illusion, made up of the\r\nintangible and the imponderable. This I have given my whole life to\r\ndiscover. Life is an illusion--why not death? Shall we dogmatize,\r\nespecially on the one thing of which we know nothing? The spirit world\r\nis unthinkable, but so, at the last analysis, is the world of matter.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man, believing this to be only the mocking mood of one who\r\nknew the argument of the dualists better than they knew it themselves,\r\nremained silent, and Weissmann composedly resumed: \"The dogmatism of\r\nHaeckel is as vain as the assumption of Metchnikoff. We shall forever\r\ndiscover and forever despair. Such is the life of man.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he went home Morton found a note from his sister saying that she\r\nhad received a message from Viola and that she would be at home at\r\nfive. \"Now don't fail to go. I have to pour tea for Sally, or I would\r\ngo with you. I'm crazy to see the girl again. I spent the morning\r\ntalking the whole thing over with Doctor Safford. She thinks as I do,\r\nthat the girl is exactly what she claims to be, a _medium_, and that\r\nwhile it is her duty to go on, she ought to be protected from the\r\nvulgar public. We both want you to take her in hand. Certainly there\r\n_ought_ to be no disgrace in standing as interpreter between the\r\nliving and the dead. Isn't it just our foolish prejudice? If the girl\r\n_can_ bring messages from the other world, she ought to be honored\r\nabove all other women. Seriously, Morton, her plea the other day wrung\r\nmy heart. I don't want you to get _too_ interested in her, of course,\r\nbut what we call a _disease_ may be a God-given power. Think of the\r\nway we run after a foolish, vulgar woman who has married into\r\nmillions, and then think of the way we sniff at this girl because she\r\nhas some gift which science doesn't understand. If one teenty, tiny\r\nbit of what they claim about her is true, science ought to cherish\r\nher. As Marion said, if she had discovered a star so far off and so\r\nfaint it wouldn't matter in the least to any one but a few cranks\r\nwhether it existed or not, she would be honored all over the world;\r\nbut as she claims to have discovered something vital to every human\r\nsoul, she is despised. It is your duty to help her. I had her over the\r\n'phone just now, and her voice was trembling with eagerness as she\r\nsaid, 'Do tell him to please come and see me.'\"\r\n\r\nThis note, so like his sister, so full of her audacities, touched\r\nMorton on the quick. It was plain that she was more than half-seas\r\nover towards faith in the girl, and quite ready to take her up and\r\nexhibit her among her friends. Her use of the word \"disease\" was\r\nintended as a mockery of his theories. He knew that she was quite\r\ncapable of talking over the 'phone precisely as she had written\r\n(reserve was not her strong point), and that she had undoubtedly given\r\nViola reason to expect him. However, having concluded on his own\r\naccount to see her once more, Kate's exhortation merely confirmed him\r\nin a good intention, \"I will confront Clarke, and try to pluck the\r\nheart out of this mystery, but I will keep clear of any personal\r\nrelation with the girl and her mother,\" he said, as if in answer to\r\nhis sister's admonition.\r\n\r\nIt was about five o'clock of the afternoon as he again mounted to\r\nPratt's portico, recalling, as he did so, the dramatic contrasting\r\nscenes of the evening before--on this side of the brick wall a\r\ncommunion with the dead, on that the throbbing, gay life of a\r\nballroom. Truly a city street was a microcosm.\r\n\r\nA solemn-visaged colored man--not the officious usher of the night\r\nbefore--took his card and led him into a gorgeous, glacial\r\nreception-room on the left. The house was very still and cold and\r\ngloomy, for the day was darkening and the lights were not yet on. It\r\nimpressed him as a vast and splendid tomb, and with a revived\r\nknowledge of Simeon Pratt's tragic history he chilled with a\r\npremonition of some approaching shadow. \"What a contrast to the sunlit\r\ncabin of the Colorow!\" he inwardly exclaimed, and the thought of the\r\nmountain girl housed in this grim and sepulchral mansion deepened his\r\nwonder.\r\n\r\nA gruff voice above inquired: \"Who is it? Let me see the card.\r\nServiss, eh? Tell him--No, wait, I'll go down and see him myself.\"\r\n\r\nMorton smiled grimly, realizing perfectly the manner in which Pratt\r\nhad intercepted his card. \"The old watch-dog,\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nA heavy tread descending the stairs announced the approach of his\r\nhost, whose sullen face was by no means engaging as he entered. \"Are\r\nyou Professor Serviss?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am.\"\r\n\r\nThe flabby lips curled in scorn. \"You are one of those scientific\r\ngentlemen who know it all, aren't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I sent my card to Miss Lambert,\" replied Serviss, with cutting\r\nformality.\r\n\r\nPratt's face darkened. \"_I_ am the master of this house.\"\r\n\r\n\"But not of your guests, I hope.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a right to know who calls, and I intend to protect Miss\r\nLambert from such as you. You were not invited here last night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not by you, I admit. I owe you an explanation for that. I came to\r\ncall on Miss Lambert. Your man shouldered me into the room before I\r\nknew what was going on. I didn't intend to 'butt in,' as they say. I\r\nwas afterwards invited forward by Mr. Clarke, as you will remember,\r\nand later by the 'control.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Clarke is not running things here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, but the spirits? Would you question their judgment? They insisted\r\non making me the guest of honor, you will remember. They played to me,\r\nyou may say.\"\r\n\r\nPratt was daunted by his visitor's mocking tone. \"You should have had\r\nmore sense of honor than to grab the medium the way you did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Being invited to sit near, I took it as an invitation to make a test.\r\nI wanted to know who held that horn. How can you hope to convince a\r\nsane mind of the truth of such an exhibition as that last night unless\r\nyou permit tests?\"\r\n\r\nThe colored man had returned. \"Miss Lambert will see you, sir. This\r\nway, please.\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment Pratt meditated interference, but something in the\r\nmovement and face of the visitor deterred him. As Serviss followed his\r\nguide up the great stairway, he asked himself: \"What will she be like?\r\nShe must be changed--deeply changed. How will she meet me?\" He\r\nacknowledged a growing excitement.\r\n\r\nShe met him so simply, so cordially, with such frank pleasure, that\r\nhis own restraint gave way at first glance. In her glowing color, in\r\nthe tones of her voice, lay a charm which carried him back to\r\nColorow, linking the mature and splendid woman with the unformed girl\r\nof the mountain-cabin. He took her hand with a keen thrill of\r\nadmiration--whatever had come to her she had gained in grace without\r\napparent loss of sincerity.\r\n\r\nHis eyes disturbed her, and she stammered some commonplace expression\r\nof pleasure, and he replied almost as lamely, then turned to the\r\nmother. \"I hope you have forgiven me for my action of last night?\"\r\nThen again to Viola. \"I only intended to touch your arm. I trust you\r\nsuffered no lasting ill effects.\"\r\n\r\nAgain something that was at once attraction and repulsion passed\r\nbetween them. She perceived in his tone a note of mockery, involuntary\r\nin its expression, but all the more significant on that account.\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry you were there,\" she quickly replied. \"I don't blame you.\r\nNo, it did not hurt me--I mean, it was all over in half an hour. The\r\ncontraction is very painful while it lasts. It's just like a cramp. I\r\ndidn't intend to give the sitting, but Mr. Pratt requested it for a\r\nfew of his friends and I couldn't well refuse. I didn't know you were\r\nthere till mamma told me afterwards. There is no value in such a\r\nsitting to you.\"\r\n\r\nWith a dim suspicion of her wish to cover some deception, he answered:\r\n\"My entrance was quite as unpremeditated, I assure you.\" He spoke with\r\nreturning humor. \"I really came to call upon you, to welcome you to\r\nthe city and to talk of the West. The usher mistook me for one of the\r\nseekers and thrust me bodily into the circle. Please believe that I\r\nacted upon sudden impulse in seizing your wrist. I am heartily ashamed\r\nof myself. I was an intruder, and had no right, no excuse--although\r\nyour 'guides,' as you call them, seemed eager to have me sit beside\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not blame you,\" she repeated, and fell strangely silent.\r\n\r\nHe studied her with mounting pleasure. The flower-like line of her\r\nlips, her glorious bosom, the poise of her head, all the lines that\r\nhad meant so much to him at their first meeting, were there, more\r\nwomanly, more dangerous in their witchery than ever. For two years\r\ntheir thoughts had subtly crossed and intertwined, and she now felt\r\nhis doubt, his question, almost as keenly as if he had uttered them.\r\n\r\nHe broke the momentary silence by saying, with a distinctly tender\r\ntone, \"Are you thinking of Colorow? I am.\"\r\n\r\nShe flushed and started a little. \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was recalling my first view of you--a fragment of sunset cloud\r\ncaught on a mountain-crag.\"\r\n\r\nHer face grew wistful. \"That seems a long time ago to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't to me. It seems but yesterday. My trip that year was a\r\nsymphonic poem with a most moving final movement. I have thought of it\r\na thousand times.\" He paused a moment, then added: \"Well, now, here\r\nyou are in New York, and here I am, and what of your music? I was to\r\nadvise you, you remember.\"\r\n\r\nHer head lifted in defiance, an adorable gesture. \"You know my secret\r\nnow.\" It was as if she said, \"Come, let us have it over.\"\r\n\r\nHe replied, very gently; \"I knew something of it then. Dr. Britt told\r\nme something of it at the time.\"\r\n\r\nHer eyes bravely searched his. \"Was that why you did not come to say\r\ngood-bye to us?\" His glance fell in a wish that she had been less\r\ncruelly direct. She went on: \"You needn't answer. I'm used to being\r\ntreated that way. I knew somebody had told you I was a medium. You\r\ndespised me when you found out about me--everybody does, except those\r\nwho want to use me. All the people I really want to know go by on the\r\nother side as if I were a leper. It was so in Boston; it is going to\r\nbe the same here.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lambert interposed. \"That is not true, Dr. Serviss. We met many\r\nnice people in Boston.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, mamma--nice people who wanted me to tell their fortunes.\"\r\n\r\nHer tone went to Serviss's heart. She was so young to be so bitter;\r\nbut he could think of nothing at the moment which would not add to her\r\nchagrin, for was not his own interpretation of her quite as hard to\r\nbear?\r\n\r\nShe went on: \"No, I don't blame you or any one for avoiding me. But I\r\nwish they would let me have one or two friends. But they won't. Lots\r\nof people like me at first, but they surely find out after a while,\r\nand then they change towards me. Sometimes I think I might as well\r\npublish my name as a medium and let everybody know it at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must not permit that, Miss Lambert,\" he earnestly said. \"That is\r\nwhat I came to say. Don't allow them to use you so.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can I help it?\" she passionately exclaimed, \"when they all demand\r\nit--mother, Mr. Clarke. Mr. Pratt, grandfather--everybody. They think\r\nI owe it to the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't. I think it is your right to say--\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no rights. Listen.\" She leaned towards him, her face paling,\r\nher eyes big and soft and terrified. \"I want you to understand me,\r\nDr. Serviss. You must know all about me.\" Her voice fell to a husky\r\nmurmur. \"You must know that I can't direct my own life. My 'guides'\r\ncan do what they please with me. Can you understand that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I confess I cannot.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true. My grandfather insists on these public tests. He is\r\ndetermined to 'convict the men of science,' and Mr. Clarke is only too\r\nglad to agree with him. Mother is controlled entirely by what\r\ngrandfather says. My wishes don't count with anybody. But I think I've\r\ndone my share in this work.\" She faced her mother in challenge and\r\nappeal. \"Ever since I was ten years old I've given myself up to it;\r\nbut now I'm afraid to go on. I don't want to be a medium all my life.\r\nThey all say it is hard to change after one is grown up, and I'm\r\nafraid,\" she repeated, with a perceptible shudder.\r\n\r\nThe mother, undisturbed by this plea, turned to Serviss with an\r\nexultant smile. \"Does she look like one breaking down?\"\r\n\r\nThe girl rose from her chair like a tragedienne. \"It isn't my body,\r\nit's my mind!\" she cried, with poignant inflection, clasping her head\r\nwith both her hands; and her look transformed her in the eyes of the\r\nyoung scientist. It was the tragic gaze of one who confronts insanity\r\nand death at a time when life should be at its sweetest. For an\r\ninstant she stood there absorbed in her terror, then dropped her\r\nhands, and in a voice of entreaty, which melted all his distrust,\r\nhurried on. \"I want to know what is going on in my brain. I am losing\r\ncontrol of my _self_! I want some man of science like you to study me.\r\nYour sister said you would help me, and you must! You think I\r\ndeceive--you thought so last night--but I don't. I knew nothing of\r\nwhat went on. I didn't know that you were there. I don't know what I\r\ndo nor what I am. I want you men of science to investigate me. I will\r\nsubmit to any test you like. You may fasten me in a cage, or padlock\r\nme down--anything!--but I will not be advertised to the world as a\r\nmedium, and I must have rest from this strain. Don't you understand?\r\nCan't you see how it will be?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" he answered, quickly. \"I understand perfectly, and I will go\r\nat once to see Mr. Clarke and intercede--\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not enough. You must intercede with my grandfather and his\r\nband, they are the ones who control me. Ask him to release me.\"\r\n\r\nThis request staggered the scientist. \"My dear Miss Lambert, you will\r\npardon me, but I can't do that--I do not even believe in the existence\r\nof your grandfather.\"\r\n\r\nShe stood in silence for a moment and then answered; \"You would if his\r\nhands were at your throat as they are at mine. He is just as real to\r\nme as you are. He is listening this minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a delusion.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish it were,\" she bitterly and tragically answered. \"The hands are\r\nso real they choke me--that I know. I am helpless when he demands\r\nthings of me. He can lead me anywhere he wants me to go. He can use my\r\narms, my voice, as he wills. You must believe in him to help me. He\r\nwill listen to you, I feel that.\" She grew appealing again. \"Your\r\nsister believes in me--I am sure of that--and my heart went out to\r\nher. Sometimes it seems as if all the world, even my own mother, were\r\nwilling to sacrifice me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Viola!\" cried Mrs. Lambert, sharply. \"You shall not say things like\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"They're true. You know they're true!\" the girl passionately retorted.\r\n\"You all treat me as if I had no more soul than a telephone.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is very unjust,\" declared Mrs. Lambert. \"This is only one of her\r\ndark moods, doctor. You must not think she really means this.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl's brows were now set in sullen lines which seemed a\r\nprofanation of her fair young face. \"But I _do_ mean it, and I want\r\nDr. Serviss to know just what is in my heart.\" Her voice choked with a\r\nkind of helpless, rebellious anger as she went on: \"I'm tired of my\r\nlife. I am sick of all these moaning people that crowd round me. It's\r\nall unnatural to me. I want to touch young people, and have a share in\r\ntheir life before I grow old. I want to know healthy people who don't\r\ncare anything about death or spirits. It's all a craze with people\r\nanyway--something that comes after they lose a wife or child. They are\r\nvery nice to me then, but after a few weeks they despise me as the\r\ndust under their feet--or else they make love to me and want to marry\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lambert rose. \"I will not allow you to go on like this, Viola. I\r\ndon't understand you to-day. You'll give Dr. Serviss a dreadful\r\nopinion of us all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care,\" the girl recklessly replied, \"I am going to be honest\r\nwith Dr. Serviss. I don't like what I do, and I don't intend to trust\r\nmy whole life to the spirits any longer. They may all be devils and\r\nlying to us. I don't believe my own grandfather would be so cruel as\r\nto push me into this public work.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lambert again warned Serviss from taking this outburst too\r\nseriously. \"She is possessed, doctor. Some bad spirit is influencing\r\nher to say these things to you. She's not herself.\"\r\n\r\nViola seized on this admission. \"That's just it. They've destroyed my\r\nown mind so that I don't know my own thoughts. If there are good\r\nspirits, there must be bad spirits--don't you think so, Dr. Serviss?\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes did not waver now. His voice was very quiet, but very\r\ndecisive, as he replied: \"My training, my habit of thinking, excludes\r\nall belief in the return of the dead either as good spirits or bad,\r\nbut if there are spirits I should certainly think evil of them if they\r\nwere to force you into a service you abhor. I do not pretend to pass\r\njudgment on your case--I know so little about it--but I do sympathize\r\nwith you. I deeply feel the injustice of these public tests, and I\r\nwill do all I can to prevent them.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lambert interrupted: \"But, Dr. Serviss, my father's advice has\r\nalways been good; to question it now would be to question my faith.\r\nHis wish is my law.\"\r\n\r\nServiss shrugged his shoulders a little impatiently. \"My dear lady, we\r\nhave no common ground there. The wishes of the dead have no weight\r\nwith me when set against the welfare of the living. The question which\r\nI beg you to consider is whether you wish your daughter to continue in\r\nthis mental torture? Do you want her name blazoned to the world as a\r\npublic medium? You cannot afford to add disgrace to her private\r\ntorment.\"\r\n\r\nThe mother held her ground. \"Her 'guides' say she will be taken care\r\nof, and as for the disgrace, that is all imaginary. It is an honor--\"\r\n\r\nViola again burst forth: \"They are always talking to me about the\r\nhonor of being a medium, about the distinction of it, and when I ask\r\nwhat distinction the world gave to the Fox sisters or Home or Madame\r\nCerillio, they answer that the world has changed since then. But it\r\nhas not changed enough to make my work respected. Mr. Clarke says it\r\nought to be; but saying so does not make it so. Every time I read of a\r\nmedium exposed I turn cold and hot, for I know people consider all\r\nmediums alike. I don't want to go about all my life like an outcast. I\r\ndon't want to be happy after I'm dead; I want to be happy now. I don't\r\nwant to be different from other girls; I want to be like them. If they\r\npublish me, I will be a medium forever. I will be in constant terror\r\nof attack, and that will drive me insane--they _must_ set me free!\r\nDr. Serviss,\" she pleaded, as if she were the victim of some murderous\r\ndesign, \"you are wise and strong. There must be some way for you to\r\nhelp me.\"\r\n\r\nAll of Serviss's well-ordered sympathetic phrases failed him as he\r\nlistened to the storm of her plea and felt the flame of her passionate\r\nprotest. All doubt of her sincerity, her own honesty, vanished, being\r\nutterly burned away by the light in her lovely eyes. Her mental\r\nbondage was real, her desire to escape contamination indubitable. He\r\nmet her gaze with tender gravity. \"I believe in you,\" he said, as if\r\ncommitting himself to a most momentous enterprise, \"and I will help\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nHis voice, so manly, so strong, so tender, robbed her of the power to\r\nspeak. She seized his extended hand in both of hers and pressed it\r\nhard, the tears in her eyes veiling her soul from the passion that\r\nfilled his glance.\r\n\r\nAs she faced him thus, leaning to him trustfully, so vivid, so\r\nmagnetic, so much the woman, so little the sibyl, that he forgot all\r\nhis hesitations and doubts, filled for an instant with an irrational\r\nimpulse to seize her, claiming her as his own, in defiance of the\r\nmandates of her world and the conventions of his own. But she dropped\r\nhis hand and turned away, and he went out in a maze of conflicting\r\ndesires, his judgment sadly clouded by the youthful riot in his blood.\r\n\r\nAt the moment he was in love with her and single-minded in his desire\r\nto aid her, to defend her, but the door had hardly closed behind him\r\nwhen his questionings, his suspicions began to file back, stealthily,\r\nsilently, along the underways of his brain. Her distress began to seem\r\na little too theatric, her troubles self-induced--all but one--madness\r\ndid in very truth seem to hover over her, a baleful, imminent shadow.\r\n\r\nClarke, looming darkly, confronted him in the lower hall. \"Well met,\r\nDr. Serviss. I'd like a word with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a request to make of you,\" responded Serviss. \"Miss Lambert\r\nhas expressed to me her great distress of mind as concerns the public\r\ntests you are planning and has asked me to intercede for her. She\r\nprofoundly objects to the use of her name, and I ask--\"\r\n\r\nClarke's voice was harsh and sullen as he interrupted: \"I have\r\nconsidered her objections and find them insufficient.\"\r\n\r\nServiss's voice rose slightly. \"Her lightest objection should be\r\ninsuperable. I don't understand your point of view. I can't see by\r\nwhat right you ignore the wish of the human soul most vitally\r\nconcerned in your crusade. You treat her as if she were a rabbit\r\ndedicated to the use of a biologic laboratory. I am better informed\r\nnow than when we met in your church-study, Mr. Clarke. I know, not\r\nmerely Miss Lambert's secret, but your own. It may be that you\r\nhonestly think this challenge will confer great distinction upon her,\r\nbut, let me assure you, it will put an ineffaceable stain upon her.\r\nFurthermore, your tests will end in disaster to yourself and to your\r\ncause.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" interposed Pratt, who had come up and\r\nstood listening. \"Do you doubt her powers?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do. She will fail, and the failure will be crushing. The thing you\r\nclaim is preposterous. Every time science has taken one of your\r\nmediums in hand he or she has suffered extinguishment. It is the\r\ngrossest outrage to ask this girl to face certain exposure. A\r\nchallenge of this blatant kind will rouse the most violent antagonism\r\namong scientists, and if you succeed in getting any really good man to\r\ntake it up--which I doubt--he will be merciless.\"\r\n\r\n\"We want him to be,\" declared Clarke. \"We glory in your defiance. Let\r\nyour scientific men come with their bands of steel, their bolts and\r\nbars, their telephones, and their electric traps. We defy every\r\nmaterial test.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are fools--madmen,\" hotly answered Serviss. \"You would sacrifice\r\nthis girl to a brazen scheme of self-advertising?\"\r\n\r\nClarke was contemptuous. \"That is your point of view. From our side\r\nthere is no greater glory than to be an Evangel of the New Faith. What\r\nmatters the comment of the gross and self-satisfied to us who work for\r\nthe happiness of those who mourn? The world in which _we_ live\r\ndespises the materialism of yours.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment a new conception of Clarke's plan crossed Serviss's\r\nmind. \"He is deeper than I thought. He would discredit the girl in the\r\neyes of normal suitors, thereby assuring her to himself.\" Aloud he\r\nsaid: \"Miss Lambert's right to herself should be your first\r\nconsideration. She is something more than a trumpet for sounding your\r\nfame.\"\r\n\r\nClarke's resounding voice had drawn Mrs. Lambert from her room, and\r\nshe now hurried down the stairway with intent to calm him.\r\n\r\nServiss turned to her. \"Again I beg of you, Mrs. Lambert, to consider\r\nwell before you consent to this plan. Your daughter's name will be a\r\njest from one end of the country to the other. It doesn't matter how\r\nsincere and earnest you are, the public will regard this challenge as\r\na seeking for notoriety. Your daughter is about to be flung to the\r\nbeasts.\" Seeing something unyielding in her eyes, he added, with such\r\nintensity his own heart responded: \"Will you stake your daughter's\r\nreputation, her health, her reason, upon the issue of a voice in the\r\ndark?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, when the voice is that of her own father. He knows the future.\r\nHe will protect her. I have no fear.\"\r\n\r\nThere was such conviction, such immutable faith in her gentle voice,\r\nthat Serviss was confounded. When he spoke, in answer, his voice was\r\nlower in key, with a cadence of hopeless appeal.\r\n\r\n\"How do you know these advisers are your husband and your father? You\r\nmust be very certain of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am certain. I believe in them as I believe in my own existence.\"\r\nThe line of her mouth lost something of its sweetness, and Serviss,\r\nseeing this, took another tack.\r\n\r\n\"Granted these voices are genuine, they may be mistaken--rash with\r\nzeal. You wouldn't say that they have gained infallibility--a\r\nknowledge of both past and future--merely by passing to the shadow\r\nworld?\"\r\n\r\nTo this Clarke made answer: \"That is precisely what we do believe.\r\nThey have predicted our future, they have laid out all our plans.\r\nTheir advice has brought us to our present high place, and we shall\r\ncontinue in our course, despite you or any other doubter.\"\r\n\r\n\"They have brought you to a very dubious sort of success,\" Serviss\r\ncuttingly replied, \"But what about your victim? I know this city and\r\nits ways. I realize, as none of you seem to do, the wasting injustice\r\nyou are about to inflict. Let me intercede--let me arrange some other\r\nplan--\"\r\n\r\nOn Clarke's face a sneering, one-sided smile crept as he answered:\r\n\"You are too late. Our plans are made, our programme published.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"The reporters have just been here. The notice of my speech and a\r\nbroad hint of the nature of my challenge will appear in four of the\r\nleading papers to-morrow morning--\"\r\n\r\n\"But Viola's--Miss Lambert's name! You surely haven't used that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no. That is to follow. The challenge, with her name and defiance,\r\nform the climax to my oration.\" He swelled with pride as he spoke, as\r\nif visualizing himself on the platform, the centre of thousands of\r\neyes, the champion of reviving faith.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God for your vanity! There is still time for some one to\r\nintervene,\" responded Serviss, minded to thrust him through.\r\n\r\nPratt shouldered in again. \"What have you got to do with it, anyway?\r\nWho asked you to interfere?\"\r\n\r\n\"The chief person concerned--Miss Lambert herself.\"\r\n\r\nPratt was about to utter some further insult when Clarke\r\ndiplomatically interposed. \"We want you to have a part in the work,\r\nDr. Serviss. We will welcome you to a committee of investigation, but\r\nwe cannot permit you to interfere with our plan. The 'Forces' are bent\r\non the work, and they are inexorable.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is you who are inexorable,\" replied the young scientist--\"you and\r\nthis deluded mother.\"\r\n\r\nThis rapid dialogue had taken place in the wide hall just beneath the\r\nhuge chandelier whose light fell on Serviss's white forehead and\r\nsquare, determined face. Pratt was confronting him with lowering brow,\r\na bear-like stoop in his shoulders, and the muttering growl of his\r\nvoice was again filling the room as Viola appeared upon the great\r\nstairway. She came slowly, with one slim hand on the railing, as\r\nthough feeling her way, and at every step mysterious, jarring sounds\r\ncame from beneath her feet and from the walls; her eyes were shut, her\r\nchin lifted, and on her face, white and tense, lay the expression of a\r\nsorrowful dreamer. Her mouth, drooping at the corners, was pitiful to\r\nsee. All her vivid youth, her flaming rebellion, had been frozen into\r\nsoulless calm by the implacable powers which reigned above and beneath\r\nher in the dark.\r\n\r\nIn horror and fierce, impotent rage, Serviss watched her descend. It\r\nwas plain that she was again in the grasp of some soul stronger than\r\nherself; and he believed this obsession, close akin to madness, to be\r\ndue to a living, overmastering magician--to Clarke, whose voice broke\r\nthe silence. \"There is your answer!\" he called, and his voice rang\r\nout, with triumphant glee. \"Her 'guides' have brought her to show you\r\nthe folly of human interference. She is only an instrument like\r\nmyself--clay to the hands of the invisible potters.\"\r\n\r\nOnce again a flaming desire to seize the girl with protecting hands\r\nfilled Serviss's young and chivalric heart; but a sense of his\r\nessential helplessness, a knowledge of his utter lack of authority,\r\nstayed his arm, while his blaze of resolution went out like a flame in\r\nthe wind. Sick with horror, he stood till Mrs. Lambert took Viola in\r\nher arms, then, in a voice that shook with passion, he said: \"Madam,\r\nyour faith in your spirits passes my understanding. Only devils from\r\nhell would demand such torture from a blithe young girl.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so saying, with shame of his impotence, and with a full\r\nrealization of Viola's mental bondage to Anthony Clarke, he turned\r\naway. \"I now understand Britt's words--only the authority of the\r\nhusband can save her from her all-surrounding foes,\" and at the moment\r\nhis fist doubled with desire to claim and exercise that power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nMORTON SENDS A TELEGRAM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe harsh reality of the outside world was like the hard-driven, acrid\r\nspray of the ocean in a wintry storm, it stung yet calmed with its\r\ngrateful, stern menace. A thin drizzle of rain was beginning to fall,\r\nand the avenues were filled with the furious clamor of belated\r\ntraffic. The clangor of the overhead trains--almost incessant at this\r\nhour--benumbed the ear, and every side-street rang with the hideous\r\nclatter of drays and express-carts, each driver, each motor-man,\r\nlaboring in a kind of sullen frenzy to reach his barn before six\r\no'clock, while truculent pedestrians, tired, eager, and exacting, trod\r\nupon one another's heels in their homeward haste.\r\n\r\nThis tumult of turbulent, coarse, unthinking life seemed at the moment\r\nnot merely normal but wholesome and admirable by force of contrast\r\nwith the morbid, unnatural, and useless scenes through which he had\r\njust passed. Better to be a burly, unreflecting truckman than a\r\ntroubled, unresting soul like Anthony Clarke, \"Yes, and better for\r\nViola Lambert to be the wife of one of these rude animal types,\r\nsuffering a life of physical hardship, than to continue the sport of\r\na man who, having lost the true values out of his own life, is\r\nremorselessly distorting those of the woman he professes to love.\"\r\n\r\nHis mind then went back, by the same law of contrast, to his momentous\r\nride across the Sulphur Spring trail. \"To think on how small a chance\r\nmy share in this girl's singular history hangs! Had I taken 'the\r\ncut-off,' as my guide suggested, had I camped in the log-cabin at the\r\nhead of the cañon, or had I saddled up the next morning and ridden\r\nover to Silver City, as I had planned, we would never have met; and I\r\nwould not now be involved in her hysterical career.\"\r\n\r\nBut he had done neither of these things. He had camped in the town, he\r\nhad sought her, and in this seeking lay something more than chance.\r\nHis second meeting was an acknowledgment of his youth and her beauty.\r\nShe had held him in the village day by day, because she was lithe of\r\nbody and fair of face and because her eyes were unaccountably wistful.\r\nYes, he had sought her that night when the river sang with joyous,\r\nimmemorial clamor, and the lamp beckoned like a hand. He had gone to\r\nher for diversion--that he now acknowledged--and he had grown each day\r\nmore deeply concerned with her life and its burdens.\r\n\r\nAnd now here she was at his door, more dangerously enthralling than\r\never, involved in a snare of most intricate pattern, calling upon him\r\nthrough some hidden affinity of their natures as no woman had ever\r\ncalled him before--calling so powerfully, so insistently, that to\r\nsave her from her peril, as pressing as it was intangible, seemed the\r\none and only task at his hand.\r\n\r\nIn this mood, sustained by the memory of her anguished face, he sent a\r\ntelegram to Lambert, urging him to come at once to the relief of his\r\nwife and daughter.\r\n\r\nHe did not appreciate the full force of this act until he left the\r\noffice and resumed his walk homeward. Then, like a shock from a\r\nbattery, came the realisation. \"I have now definitely intervened; but\r\nhow weakly, how ingloriously!\"\r\n\r\nThis thought grew less agreeable and more humiliating as he dwelt upon\r\nthe possible consequences. \"Will Lambert remember me? Will he take my\r\nwarning to heart?\"\r\n\r\nIn imagination he followed the small envelope as it passed to the hand\r\nof a messenger and started up that fearsome, splendid trail towards\r\nthe mill. The world was stern and cold and white and still up there in\r\nthe Basin--winter yet reigned in majesty and the pathways were deep\r\nsunk in heaped and sculptured snows.\r\n\r\nUp to the half-buried office the courier would ride, and with a cheery\r\nhalloo call Lambert to the door. What would he think upon receiving\r\nsuch an imperative summons from a stranger? \"Did I make the situation\r\nclear? He may imagine that some dire physical disaster has overtaken\r\nhis women. But that would be true. Their peril is none the less real\r\nbecause intangible, and yet my part in it may not seem either wise or\r\nmanly.\"\r\n\r\nIn truth every step towards his own door removed him an emotional\r\nleague from the scene in the hall, and as the throb of Viola's\r\nagonized voice died out of his ears the crisis in her life grew\r\nhysteric, unsubstantial, and at last unreal. Her gestures, her plea\r\nfor help, her descent of the stairway, came to seem like the climaxes\r\nin a singular drama powerfully acted. \"God! what an actress--if she\r\n_is_ an actress!\" he exclaimed, as the tragic intensity of her face\r\nreturned upon him.\r\n\r\nHe passed from this to the next phase of his development. In a certain\r\ngood-humored way he had accepted his friend Tolman's theories of\r\nhypnotic control, but had never taken them into serious account till\r\nthis moment. He was forced now to admit the entire truth of\r\n\"suggestion\" or to charge this girl, whose character so bewitched him,\r\nwith being an impostor. She was either a marvellous artist in\r\ndeception or Clarke controlled her through some sinister and\r\nlittle-understood law of the mind. What else could have brought her\r\ncreeping like a somnambulist down the stairway to demonstrate her\r\ntormentor's demoniacal sovereignty? And if he could call her to him in\r\nsuch wise, then all the weird tales of the romancers, all the\r\nhalf-mythical doings of Mesmer and Charcot, were true, and the feet of\r\nBulwer Lytton's remorseless lover solidly set upon the rock of fact.\r\n\r\n\"My school of thought is very exact and very dogmatic. It prides\r\nitself on not looking beyond its nose. There is no room in our\r\ntext-books for this girl and her claims. But--\" He stood on the\r\ncorner and surveyed the familiar scene, the rushing, commonplace men,\r\nthe commonplace horses, the commonplace, ugly walls and signs, and for\r\nan instant they lost substance, became as shadowy as drifting mist,\r\nthe men were of no more bulk than phantoms, the walls and pavements\r\nbut the effluvia of the commonplace perceiving mind. All were as\r\ntransitory as smoke, as illusionary as the opium-eater's mid-day\r\ndream. What did it signify--this mad rush to get round a corner to\r\ncreep into a hole? Why should he trouble himself about one of the\r\nmillions of women, evanescent as butterflies, with which the earth\r\ncontinually replenished its swarms of men?\r\n\r\nHe walked on, eager to return to his own little nest, to his books,\r\nhis easy-chair, his glowing fire. What folly to go out of his own\r\nlife, to profess accountability for the welfare of a girl whom he had\r\nseen but a few hours in all his life. Why trouble to explain her case?\r\nWas it worth while to dethrone Spencer in order to defend the action\r\nof a child's disordered mind.\r\n\r\nThis mood gave way to one far less philosophical--he permitted himself\r\na moment of exultation over his youth. Science had not yet taken out\r\nof him the nerves that leap to the touch of a woman's palm--the right\r\nwoman. Ten years' deep, patient, absorbing dissection of pathologic\r\ntissue had not rendered the gloss and glow of a girl's cheek less\r\nvelvet-soft. On the contrary, the healthy, wholesome flesh, the\r\nmatured beauty of this mountain maid seemed of more worth than any\r\nfame to be wrung from the niggard hands of the Royal Academy. The\r\nabsorption of the true scientist was completely broken up. \"Love is\r\nworth while,\" he said, in answer to himself, \"and to serve others the\r\nonly solace in the end.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nDR. BRITT PAYS HIS DINNER-CALL\r\n\r\n\r\nKate had not returned, and he was glad of this, for it gave him time\r\nin which to recover his normal serenity of mind. He met her at dinner\r\nwith an attempt at humor, but she was not to be deceived nor put off\r\nfrom the main subject. He was forced to make instant report, which he\r\ndid, leaving out, however, all the deeply emotional passages. He fell\r\nsilent in the midst of this story--profoundly stirred by the memory of\r\nViola's confiding gesture as she leaned to him, awed by the essential\r\npurity of the soul he perceived lying deep in her eyes. How blue, how\r\nprofound they seemed at the moment!\r\n\r\nKate, if she perceived his abstraction, ignored it. \"Well, I hope you\r\nagree with me now. Clarke is her control, her black beast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; that is the only explanation at this moment, the only solution\r\nwhich leaves her innocent.\"\r\n\r\n\"But to admit that is to admit a good deal, Mr. Scientist.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that, Mrs. Precipitancy; but what would you have me do? I\r\ndon't want to believe the girl a trickster.\" After a pause he said:\r\n\"Kate, I never felt less of a man than I acknowledged myself to be as\r\nI turned away, leaving her in the clutches of those accursed\r\nfanatics.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"What else could I do? She was entranced--I had no authority. My\r\nattempt at a rescue would have created a disgusting scene and put\r\nClarke on his guard. My native caution and my conventional training\r\ncombined to paralyze me.\"\r\n\r\nKate, fired with reckless ardor, said, \"Let's go and snatch her\r\naway--now!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, my second thought is best. Think of what Clarke's arrest would\r\nmean to the girl and to us? No, we must wait for Lambert. Clarke at\r\npresent has all the authority. It won't do to push him. He would\r\ninstantly trumpet her name to the four winds of heaven if he thought\r\nwe were about to interfere. If Lambert heeds my warning, he will\r\narrive on Friday, and that will prevent the challenge.\"\r\n\r\n\"What sort of person is this Mr. Lambert?\"\r\n\r\nServiss pondered, \"He's a small, mild-mannered man--not unlike a nice,\r\nthoughtful country doctor in appearance.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish he were six feet high, and fierce as his inches,\" said Kate.\r\n\r\n\"If he had been that, this preacher fellow would never have been able\r\nto run away with his family.\" He sighed. \"Well, he's all we have to\r\nconjure with. If he fails us we must resort to craft.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish we could get Viola and her mother here. Would they come to\r\ndinner if I should ask them? If we could get them here once we might\r\nbe able to persuade them to stay.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would not save her from the pillory in which Pratt and Clarke\r\ndesign to set her. We must be careful not to anger them. The girl\r\nhates and fears Pratt.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know she does.\"\r\n\r\n\"His air of proprietorship is fairly indecent. We must be especially\r\ncareful not to rouse him. He has millions to use in asserting his\r\nclaims, and is as vindictive as a wolf.\"\r\n\r\nKate sat in silence for a few moments--a very unusual state with\r\nher--and at last announced her purpose. \"Leave the whole thing to me.\r\nWe will have Dr. Weissmann, and I will ask Clarke to come to meet you\r\nin order to talk over his plans for a committee. I'll just ignore\r\nPratt. He's nothing but an old kill-joy, anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's worse than that. Don't brush him the wrong way. We're going to\r\nhave trouble with him before we are out of this.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care. I will not have him in my house,\" responded Kate.\r\n\r\n\"Very well. He's eliminated. I hope Clarke will permit them to come.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they'll come unless Pratt absolutely locks them in their rooms.\r\nShall I ask Marion and Paul?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I want a chance to talk to our 'psychic' alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well. The table just balances, anyway. Now, about your\r\ntelegram, are you going to speak to Mrs. Lambert about that?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. It is all up to Lambert. He can act or not, as he sees fit. He\r\nwill probably wire them that he is coming, and as there can be no\r\nexplanations till he arrives you will please say nothing of my share\r\nin the warning.\"\r\n\r\nThey had just risen from the table when Britt sent in his card.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse my calling so early,\" he began, with tranquil drawl, \"but I'm\r\ngoing back to the West to-night. I've got to get out of this climate\r\nor join the spooks. I'm thinking of doing that, anyway, just to see\r\nwhat it's like 'round the corner in the 'fourth dimension,' and also\r\nbecause I'd like a change of climate.\"\r\n\r\n\"You look well--exceedingly well,\" Kate cheerily replied.\r\n\r\n\"You're very good; but I don't feel as well as I look. My poor one\r\nlung is working overtime, and a collapse is imminent. I don't see how\r\nmy beloved brother Clarke bears up. He must get help from the 'other\r\nside.' You see, _he_ spent the winter in Boston--think o' that! But\r\nit's telling on him. If I wished him well--which I don't--I'd advise\r\nhim to return to Colorado and to his Presbyterianism by the limited\r\nmail.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could he do that--I mean go back to his church?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't suppose he could. You see, he went out under a cloud--took\r\nthe whole window-sash with him, you might say--and I don't think the\r\nelders would welcome his relapse. Furthermore, he has embraced\r\n'spiritism,' as he calls it, with both arms. By-the-way, professor,\r\nI've been talking about these psychic matters with Weissmann and\r\nothers, and I agree with him that you're the very man to go into an\r\ninvestigation of these occult forces.\"\r\n\r\n\"And be called insane, as Zöllner was?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well, times have softened since then. Now, really, what do _you_\r\nthink of Zöllner's experiments?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish he hadn't been so eager to demonstrate the fourth\r\ndimension--that vitiated everything he did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't know. I've been rereading Lodge and Wallace and Meyer. We\r\nstudied them when I was at college, mainly to click our tongues--'poor\r\nold chaps!'\" He smiled. \"You understand? Of course, I can't go the\r\nwhole length, but I must say I don't know what you're going to do with\r\nthe evidence Crookes collected.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Slade and Home and the Fox sisters, from whom he drew his\r\n'facts,' were exposed again and again, and one of the Fox sisters\r\nconfessed to fraud, didn't she?\"\r\n\r\n\"M--yes. But afterwards recanted and re-recanted. They were all a\r\ndubious lot, I'll admit. That is why I hate to see a girl like Viola\r\nLambert put in their class by a self-seeking fakir like Clarke.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Is_ he self-seeking--or is he only a fanatic?\" asked Kate. \"I\r\nbelieve him to be quite sincere--that's why he's so dangerous. He is\r\nwilling to walk hot plough-shares to advance his faith. What _are_ his\r\nrelations to Viola? Do you suppose she has actually promised to marry\r\nhim?\"\r\n\r\nServiss waited for his reply in such suspense that his hands clutched\r\nhis chair. Britt's face lost its gleam. \"I'm afraid she has--or at\r\nleast she feels herself 'sealed to him' by her 'controls.'\" Serviss\r\nrose and took a turn about the room as Britt went on. \"You see, this\r\nsweet-tempered old ghost McLeod is anxious to have his granddaughter\r\nunite her powers with Clarke's in order to 'advance the Grand Cause.'\r\nMcLeod, it seems, was a Presbyterian clergyman himself here 'on the\r\nearth plane,' and has carried his granitic formation right along with\r\nhim. I've argued with the old man by the hour, but his egotism is\r\ninvincible.\"\r\n\r\nServiss faced him abruptly. \"Now, see here, Britt. You've seen a good\r\ndeal of Miss Lambert's performances--what's your honest opinion of\r\nthem?\"\r\n\r\n\"Frankly, I don't know,\" he answered, with a smile. \"Since rereading\r\nZöllner and Crookes and going over my notes and those of Dr. Randall,\r\nI'm a little shaken, I confess. So far as human evidence goes these\r\nmen prove that there is a world of phenomena ignored by science. I\r\ndon't go so far as to say that these doings were the work of\r\ndisembodied spirits, but I do admit that I am puzzled by things which\r\nI have witnessed with one sense or another. The things seem to tally\r\nin a most convincing way. This girl is repeating, substantially, the\r\nsame phenomena witnessed by Crookes twenty-five years ago. The\r\nsingular thing about the whole subject is that one man can't convince\r\nanother by any amount of evidence. A personal revelation is necessary\r\nfor each individual.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't that true of other faiths?\" asked Kate.\r\n\r\n\"No, there's a difference. For example, I would take your brother's\r\nevidence as to a new germ; but as to a spirit--no. And yet one is\r\nquite as incredible as another. Crookes applied the same methods to\r\nthe study of these manifestations that he used in his other\r\nresearches, and piled up a mass of evidence, yet his fellows of the\r\nRoyal Academy sneered or haw-hawed--and do yet. Do you know, doctor,\"\r\nhe continued, \"I have moments when I dimly suspicion that we\r\nscientists are a thought too arrogant. We lose the expectant mind. We\r\nassume that we've corralled and branded all facts, when, as a matter\r\nof history, there are scattered bunches of cattle all through the\r\nhills. Take Haeckel, for instance. He talks very like the head of a\r\nchurch laying down the law to you and to me as well as to the ignorant\r\noutsider. Spencer was a good deal less sure of himself. It takes a\r\nphysical specialist to be cock-sure. Darwin never professed to solve\r\nthe final mystery of life or death, but Haeckel and Metchnikoff do.\r\nThey are so militant against religion that they become intolerant of\r\ntheir colleagues who presume to differ with them on matters that are\r\npurely speculative. Any one attempting to discuss new phases of human\r\nthought is a fakir. I am not willing to say that all the notions of\r\nthe 'dualists' are survivals of the age of superstition, as Haeckel\r\ndoes. It may be that in the midst of all their fancies which _are_\r\nsurvivals there are some subtle perceptions of the future.\"\r\n\r\nServiss lifted his eyebrows in surprise. \"That's a whole lot for you\r\nto concede. Weissmann must have been corrupting you.\"\r\n\r\nBritt went on: \"We must always remember that every age is an age of\r\ntransition. We are losing faith in the revelations of the past, but we\r\nshould not presume to define the faith of the future. Men will not\r\nlive in the hopelessness which the monists would thrust upon them,\r\nthey will not patiently wait while Pasteur and Koch and the other germ\r\ntheorists labor to prolong the life of some other generation. They\r\nwill always insist on having something to live for and to die for. I\r\ndon't pretend to say what this faith will be, but it will be\r\nsufficing.\"\r\n\r\nKate exclaimed with glowing eyes: \"And all this change in you two men\r\nhas come about through the influence of a pretty girl!\"\r\n\r\nThe two inexorables looked at each other with a certain air of\r\ntimidity, and Britt's face expanded in a slow, sly smile. \"You've\r\ndiscovered us. We are human, like the rest of our sex, if you catch us\r\nout of our laboratories. Theoretically we hold life of no account\r\nactually we're all lovers or husbands.\" A mockery more moving than\r\ntears came into his voice. \"My hopeless philosophy, dear lady, arises\r\nfrom weak nerves and a poor digestion. I would give all I know of\r\nscience, all I expect to be in my profession, and all I hope to be\r\nafter I am dead, for just five years of health, such as Lambert's\r\nminers squander in carousals every Saturday night in the saloons of\r\nColorow. I hold with Haeckel in one thing--I believe in a man's right\r\nto suicide, and when I find myself of no further use to the sick I\r\nshall slip quietly out. I hope I won't have to poison Clarke before I\r\ngo. I'd do it cheerfully if I thought it the only way to rid that girl\r\nof him.\" Seeing that his hostess was really shocked by these words, he\r\nlightly ended: \"However, I think such extreme measures unnecessary.\r\nI'm going to send Lambert on to kill him for me.\"\r\n\r\nKate looked at Morton with inquiring eye--he shook his head.\r\n\r\nBritt resumed: \"I am trusting in you, Serviss. If I could be sure of\r\nliving two weeks longer I would stay and help, but money and breath\r\nare now vital to me, and I must go. However, I'm perfectly willing to\r\nput Clarke out of the way if you advise it. He really ought to die,\r\nMrs. Rice,\" he gravely explained as he rose to go. \"He is a male\r\nvampire. To think of him despoiling that glorious young soul maddens\r\nme. I am the son of a coarse, powerful, sensual, drunken father; but\r\nhe neglected to endow me with his brutal health. My mother was an\r\ninvalid; therefore, here am I, old and worn out at forty--that's why I\r\nworship youth and beauty. Health is the only heaven I know, and that\r\nis denied me.\" Here his smile died, his eyes softened, and his face\r\nset in impenetrable gravity. \"Had I the power I would keep Viola\r\nLambert forever young and forever virgin.\" Then, with a quick return\r\nto his familiar drawl: \"But I am going away without even killing\r\nClarke, to plod my little round in Colorow and wait news from you. If\r\nI do not see you again, Mrs. Rice, keep me in mind. I make the same\r\npromise your husband made--I will 'manifest' to you if I can.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would rather you came in the flesh,\" she replied.\r\n\r\nHe bowed deeply. \"I thank you both for a very satisfying glimpse of a\r\ncivilised home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes I think we're over-civilized,\" she replied, quickly. \"But\r\ncome and see us again.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear it will be as a spook--they laugh at microbes as well as\r\nlocks. However, I promise to rap when I call.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, that will make you a most considerate ghost.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they were alone together Kate said, with a sigh: \"What an amount\r\nof sin and sickness and trouble and death there is in the world!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a sign we're getting on,\" he replied. \"When we're young we\r\nlaugh at the falling leaves--they are only a sign of some new sport.\r\nWhen I'm as old as you are I suppose I'll begin to observe all the\r\nbald-heads at the theatre.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, for our dinner-party. I must write to Mrs. Lambert\r\nto-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd better take second thought about this matter--'Reckless Kate.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take a third. Consider this--the girl may go into a trance at the\r\ntable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if she only would! My fear is she'll be like other amateur\r\nperformers--'subject to a cold' or something. These gifted people are\r\nso often disappointing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, see here, Kit, seriously, if you invite Miss Lambert to our\r\nhouse it must be as any other charming guest--\"\r\n\r\n\"You didn't suppose I was _really_ going to ask her to spookle?\" she\r\nindignantly answered; then added, with a smile: \"Of course, if she\r\n_insists_ on reading my palm--or--any little thing like that, it\r\nwouldn't be nice to refuse, would it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew it! You have designs upon her. Don't do it. It would be too\r\ngross after your protest against others for using her. She herself\r\ncomplained bitterly of just this treatment. You must not even speak of\r\nher powers.\"\r\n\r\nShe lifted her hand solemnly. \"_I swear!_\"\r\n\r\n\"I mistrust you even when you swear,\" he ended, doubtfully. \"There's a\r\ntell-tale gleam in your eyes.\"\r\n\r\nAnd at this moment of banter they both lost their sense of the girl's\r\nimminent peril and thought of her only as a most entertaining\r\npossibility as a guest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nVIOLA IN DINNER-DRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nViola glowed with joy over Kate's invitation to dinner, and, flying to\r\nthe telephone (as she was requested to do), accepted without\r\nconsulting either her mother or Clarke, and fell immediately into\r\nwonder whether she possessed a gown becoming enough to fit the golden\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lambert was also pleased, but at once said, \"I hope Tony will\r\nfeel like going.\"\r\n\r\nViola resented the implied doubt of their own acceptance. \"I am going,\r\nanyhow. I will not be shut up here any longer like a convict. I like\r\nMrs. Rice very much, and I want to see her house. I know it will be\r\njust as nice as she is.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we can't go without Anthony, my dear.\"\r\n\r\nClarke came to the door a little later to say that he had received\r\nMrs. Rice's invitation, but that he did not care to feed the curiosity\r\nof such people. \"You would better plead a previous engagement,\" he\r\nadded to Viola.\r\n\r\n\"I'll do nothing of the sort,\" she indignantly answered. \"Indeed, I've\r\nalready accepted. You needn't look black--I'm going,\" she added, in\r\npouting defiance.\r\n\r\nSomething in her look as well as in her tone convinced him that wisdom\r\nlay in not attempting to restrain her, therefore he gave assent,\r\ngloomily and with a sense of loss. \"I don't know how Pratt will feel\r\nabout it. He don't like those people, and, besides, he has invited\r\nsome friends in to see you this evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"He said nothing to me about it,\" Viola responded, curtly, \"and,\r\nbesides, how can he expect me to be always at his command? He is not\r\nmy jailer. I'm tired of his demands, they are so unreasonable.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lambert, as usual, entered to soothe and heal. \"Viola's been very\r\ngood about meeting Mr. Pratt's friends, Tony. We've hardly been out to\r\ndinner since we came here, and it really seems to me as if we had the\r\nright to go out to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"We ought to have Thursdays, anyway,\" the girl scornfully added. \"We\r\nhave less liberty than our maids. The whole situation is becoming\r\nintolerable.\"\r\n\r\nClarke acknowledged that Pratt demanded a good deal, and was gracious\r\nenough to say: \"It won't be necessary much longer. I'll go down and\r\ntry to arrange the matter, and report what he says.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care what he says, I'm going,\" Viola repeated. \"I'm going if\r\nhe locks us out. I wish he would.\"\r\n\r\nPratt was resentful at once. \"I don't want her to go to-night. I have\r\nsome people coming in to see her. I don't want them disappointed; she\r\nmust remain.\"\r\n\r\n\"She feels aggrieved because she has been kept so close here, and I\r\nmust say--\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see why she feels that way, she has every luxury. She goes\r\nfor a drive every afternoon, and there is hardly a night that I don't\r\nbring home somebody to dinner. It seems to me she's seeing all the\r\npeople she ought to see. I don't believe in having her mix with those\r\nsceptics too freely.\"\r\n\r\nHe went up-stairs sulkily, quite in the mood to bully, but Mrs.\r\nLambert turned away his wrath with a smile and several soft words, and\r\nViola did not see him till she was on her way to the carriage. He was\r\nlurking in the hall below, waiting for her surly and sour and\r\ninsulting.\r\n\r\nViola, perceiving his humor, said to herself: \"I will not let you\r\nspoil my evening by making me angry. I will not listen to you,\" and\r\nshe didn't, though she could not help hearing his warning growl.\r\n\r\n\"I'll expect you home early.\"\r\n\r\nOnce safely out of the house she said to Clarke: \"This really is too\r\nmuch, Anthony. He is insufferable. If you don't tell him so, and teach\r\nhim better manners, I will leave the house. But there! I said I\r\nwouldn't let him spoil our evening, and I won't--I won't even think of\r\nhim again.\"\r\n\r\nServiss expected her to show some signs of the deep emotional stress\r\nof his former interview, but in this he was most pleasurably\r\nsurprised. He marvelled at the height of her rebound from the wan\r\nhelplessness of her mood upon the stairs. She was, indeed, a totally\r\ndifferent being--a radiant, blooming creature belonging wholly to the\r\nworld of youth--and he was scarcely able to relate the two scenes to\r\nthe same girl, and again he exclaimed, \"What an actress--if she is an\r\nactress!\" She was very simply attired in pale blue with but few\r\nornaments, but she bore herself like a queen demanding homage--and he\r\ngave it. He was all the lover and nothing of the scientist as he stood\r\nto greet her.\r\n\r\nShe, on her part, behind her proud mask, was breathing quick with\r\npleasure. To meet Professor Serviss in dinner-dress, in his own home,\r\nexalted her above the pupil and transformed him into something more\r\nintimate than the master--something more dangerously compelling than\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nKate, quite carried away by her enthusiasm, caught the girl again in\r\nher arms. \"You dear, sweet thing! I wish I had made a big party for\r\nyou; you're too fine to be wasted on three cranky old scientists.\"\r\n\r\nServiss met Clarke with less of repulsion than he had anticipated,\r\nfor, notwithstanding the preacher's haggard cheeks and a certain set\r\nglare which came into his eyes occasionally, he was a handsome figure.\r\nHe was plainly on guard, however, and extremely ill at ease, and his\r\neyes kept furtive watch on Viola's every movement.\r\n\r\nKate at once engaged him in conversation in order that he and Morton\r\nmight not fall into argument, and with the further purpose of\r\npermitting her young people a little time for mutual explanation. She\r\nwas glad when Weissmann came in, brisk as a boy, his keen eyes\r\npeering alertly through his horn-bowed glasses; he not merely proved a\r\ndiversion, he completed her party. The great man was as animated as a\r\ncricket (this was his society manner), and upon being presented to\r\nViola began paying her the most marked and absorbed attention, hopping\r\nbriskly from one heavy German compliment to another, quite unaware,\r\napparently, that she was anything more than a very pretty girl.\r\n\r\nHe took her out to dinner, with elaborate courtesy, and divided his\r\nattentions between his partner and his hostess with mathematical\r\nprecision, beaming now upon Viola, now upon Kate, with such\r\nwell-calculated intervals that Serviss broke into a broad smile.\r\n\r\n\"You find yourself well placed, Dr. Weissmann?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well placed and well pleased,\" he responded, quickly, \"with no thanks\r\nto you, I suspect.\"\r\n\r\nKate was much relieved by Weissmann's liking for Viola--it made her\r\nparty a little less difficult; but she was anxious to have Morton free\r\nto talk with Viola, and to that end drew the good doctor into\r\nconversation with Clarke, who was not at all pleased with his seat,\r\nwhich was by design at the farthest remove from his psychic. He saw no\r\nreason why they might not have been seated side by side.\r\n\r\nAs Kate remarked to Marion afterwards, it was a hard team to drive,\r\nfor the table was too small to permit anything like private\r\nconversation at either end, and to enter upon general topics was to\r\nstart Clarke and Weissmann into dialectic clamor. \"I trusted in the\r\nfood,\" she answered to Marion's query. \"It was a good dinner and kept\r\neven the preacher silent--part of the time.\"\r\n\r\nClarke's face was flushed with wine, and his glance, which rested\r\noften on Viola, was not pleasant. He was afraid of her when she shone\r\nthus brightly among careless, worldly, sceptical people. She seemed to\r\nforget her work, her endowments, and to think only of flattering\r\nspeeches and caresses. It was all so childish, so foolish in her, so\r\nundignified in one who meant so much to the sin-darkened world.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lambert, on the contrary, was humanly glad (for the moment, at\r\nleast) of her daughter's respite from her grave duties, and sat\r\nblandly smiling while the young people talked animatedly on a wide\r\nlist of subjects.\r\n\r\nMorton was delighted to find that Viola had read a good many books,\r\nnot always the best books, but of such variety that her mind was by no\r\nmeans that of the school-girl. Her experience in life was very slight,\r\nbut her hunger to know was keen. He was eager to draw her out on her\r\nmorbid side, but, as he had said to Kate, \"We must not permit anything\r\nto rob her of one evening of unbroken normal intercourse. If you can\r\nmanage Clarke, I will do the rest.\"\r\n\r\nKate tried hard to \"manage Clarke,\" and was succeeding rather\r\nadroitly. Whenever he seemed about to enter upon a discourse she\r\ninterrupted him, met his ponderous phrases with flippancies, plied him\r\nwith food (for which he had a singular weakness), and in many other\r\nwomanly ways discouraged and, in the end, intimidated him. He was at a\r\ndistinct disadvantage and knew it, and the knowledge irritated him.\r\nHowever, with all his eccentricities he was a man of considerable\r\nsocial experience, and, while he was not at any time joyous of\r\ncountenance, he did not in open guise offend, though he sank at last\r\ninto a glowering silence, leaving the talk to Weissmann.\r\n\r\nMorton gave much attention to Mrs. Lambert, securing from her, almost\r\nbefore she realized it, a promise to join a theatre-party, and\r\nthereupon turned to Viola to say, \"I hope you will consent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Consent?\" she cried, with shining eyes. \"I should like it above\r\neverything. You see I've never really _lived_ in a big city, and it's\r\nall so new and splendid to me.\"\r\n\r\nMorton responded lightly. \"I wish I could see it with your eyes. I\r\nsuppose New York is a wonderful city, and I'm sure all this chaos is\r\nmaking towards something unparalleled in beauty, but just now I take\r\nthe point of view of a native who has been driven out of the good old\r\ndown-town streets by vulgar trade. The Servisses lived for forty years\r\nat the corner of Corlear Square, but four years ago a big apartment\r\nhotel rose next door, shutting off our light, and we had to move.\r\nHence our acrimony. The city grows more and more a show-place, wherein\r\nthe prodigal American may buy the pleasure he thinks commensurate.\r\nMost of us who were born here have quite lost our hold on the earth;\r\nfor instance, here we are, Kate and I, treed in a ten-story hotel on\r\nground from which we used to gather huckleberries, and therein lies\r\nthe history of many another New York family.\"\r\n\r\nViola looked round the spacious and handsome dining-room. \"I think\r\nthis way of living is beautiful. I want mamma to take an apartment\r\nover here on the Park. I love the Park, although it makes me homesick\r\nfor the West sometimes.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you do decide to take an apartment, consult Kate. What she doesn't\r\nknow of New York isn't lady-like for any one to know. Frankly, Mrs.\r\nLambert, I should be very glad to see you get away from Pratt's house.\r\nHe is, I fear, a selfish, brutal business-man--an egotist who would\r\nsacrifice you both instantly if it would add to his comfort of mind or\r\nbody. But wait. I am forgetting my duties as host--we are to avoid all\r\nunpleasant topics,\" and thereupon he led the conversation back to\r\nimpersonal discussions of books and music.\r\n\r\nAll through this exquisite little dinner Viola sat with a\r\nstrengthening determination to assert her right to leave her gloomy\r\nprison-house on the Drive, a house in which there was neither\r\nwholesome conversation nor privacy nor order. An ambition to live\r\nhumanly and harmoniously in an apartment like this grew each moment in\r\ndefiniteness. She appreciated the delicacy of the centre-piece of\r\nmaidenhair-fern, veiling with its cloud of green a few flame-like\r\njonquils. She took a woman's joy in the immaculate napery and in the\r\ncharm and variety of the china. Such housekeeping was an art, and\r\nquite impossible without the personal touch of the mistress, and, as\r\nshe looked across towards Kate's homely, pleasant face, her heart went\r\nout to her in gratitude and love. She could be trusted, this frank,\r\nlaughing, graceful woman. She represented a most modern union of\r\nhousewife and intellectual companion. No wonder Dr. Serviss remained\r\nunmarried.\r\n\r\nClarke's forbidding, unrelenting face, looming darkly at Kate's side,\r\nwas revealed to her in a new and most unpleasant light. She resented\r\nhis scowling glances, and pitied his failure to glow in such genial\r\ncompany. She saw him for the first time the prosing bigot, narrow and\r\nrepulsive. She resented his failure to subordinate his theories. Up to\r\nthis moment she had supposed herself respecting him; now she began to\r\nrealize that she had lost even that, and the thought made her shiver\r\nwith foreboding. How different were the men of science, with their\r\njocular, irrelevant, but always illuminating comment on whatever\r\nsubject they handled! It was all touch and go with them, and yet they\r\nwere quite as serious as he.\r\n\r\nAs the coffee came in Kate rose with a word of caution: \"Morton, we'll\r\nexpect you to join us soon--\"\r\n\r\n\"You may depend upon us,\" replied Weissmann.\r\n\r\n\"And you mustn't talk out all the interesting subjects--save some of\r\nthem for us to hear.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall not be able to talk on any other subject than yourselves,\"\r\nretorted Weissmann, gallantly, \"and that would not be good for you to\r\nhear.\"\r\n\r\nKate laughed. \"I know what that means. These Western girls are\r\ncompelling creatures. Well, I will not complain if she only shakes you\r\nout of your scientific complacency.\"\r\n\r\nThey were hardly out of the room before Weissmann asked, \"Is Miss\r\nLambert from the West?\"\r\n\r\n\"From the Rocky Mountains.\"\r\n\r\n\"So? I find her quite charming.\"\r\n\r\nMorton dryly answered: \"I noticed that. Yes, she's Western born, but\r\nof Eastern stock. Mr. Clarke is a New-Yorker, I believe.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was born in Maryland, sir, but all my early life was spent in\r\nBrooklyn.\"\r\n\r\nWeissmann turned his telescopic eyes upon Clarke and studied him in\r\nsilence somewhat as a pop-eyed crab might regard a clam. \"So, so,\" he\r\nsaid, softly. \"You are the one who is preparing to assault the\r\nscientific world--the Clarke mentioned in the papers to-day?\"\r\n\r\nClarke folded his arms in defiant mood. \"I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"And this charming girl is your victim--the one for whom you make such\r\nclaims, eh?\"\r\n\r\nClarke regarded the old man with imperious lift of the head. \"She is,\r\nwithout question, the most marvellous psychic in the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Psychic!'\" Weissmann barked this word at him like an angry mastiff.\r\n\"'Psychic!' What business has she to be a 'psychic'? She is too lovely\r\nto be anything but a wife and mother--a happy hausfrau. And you would\r\nmake her infamous? My friend, I do not understand you.\"\r\n\r\nClarke's eyes blazed. \"If I had the power I would lay her message\r\nbefore every living soul on the globe. Infamy? Sir, I know no higher\r\nhonor than that of being cup-bearer to despairing souls thirsting for\r\nthe water of life.\" Then a direct answer to the old man's prolonged\r\nstare: \"You need have no fear. I will not go one jot beyond the advice\r\nof her 'guides.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Her 'guides'? Who are they?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean her invisible ministers, compared with whose wisdom our\r\nlearning is child's prattle for they are one with the sages of\r\nhistory. Their minds drink of the limitless ocean of all past\r\nknowledge and catch the gleam of discovery to come. Furthermore\"--here\r\nhis voice grew hard and his glance shifted to Serviss--\"no one living\r\nhas a more vital interest in her welfare than I. Surely I may be\r\ntrusted to guard and cherish one who is soon to be my wife.\"\r\n\r\nThis blow, delivered with the orator's telling arrangement of phrase,\r\nfell with tremendous force upon Serviss, towards whom it was\r\nvengefully directed. With a heart filled with anger and disgust and\r\npain the young host responded: \"I am glad to have this assurance from\r\nyou, for your action has seemed to me calculated to do Miss Lambert\r\nirreparable injury. Of course, I do not doubt your good intentions as\r\nregards her--I cannot do that after your final statement--but I think\r\nyou underestimate your opposing force.\"\r\n\r\n\"We expect battle, but nothing can really harm us. What do we care for\r\nthe puerile dispraise of the press? We are doing God's work in the\r\nworld, and as for the scientists, they are as moles in the dark.\"\r\n\r\nWeissmann's voice became reflective. \"Do the parents of the girl not\r\nobject?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite the contrary. Her mother trained her for this great work.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is very strange--this mother _seems_ nice and sensible.\"\r\n\r\nClarke sneered. \"You physicists think nothing is natural or sensible\r\nbut your own grubbing. You nose in the mire studying parasites of\r\ndecaying flesh, while we are lifting wing into the world of spirit\r\nwhere neither pain nor death is known. You are blinded by your\r\nbigotry, or you would see the leading of every new discovery in the\r\nmodes of motion. Heat, light, the X-ray, the emanation of radium--do\r\nthey not all point to new subtleties of the physical universe? The\r\npower which the spirits use to communicate with us, the world which\r\nthey inhabit, is only a higher evolution, a more potent condition--\"\r\n\r\nWeissmann arrested him in full flight and began to question him about\r\nViola's powers, drawing from him rapidly, and with the precision of a\r\ngreat lawyer, all that he would say of her case, while Serviss,\r\nsmoking quietly, listened in deep amazement, so candid, so sincere did\r\nClarke seem to be in his answers. He was more--he became eloquent,\r\nalmost convincing; and the young scientist was forced to acknowledge\r\nonce more that appearances were deceitful. \"Can this man be the fakir\r\nI have thought him? He is a bigot, a crazy fool, but he does not fit\r\nthe rôle of villain; and yet--\"\r\n\r\nHe could not put the alternative into words, so deeply did it involve\r\nViola herself.\r\n\r\nThe preacher was in full flow--turgid, studiedly ornate, egotistical,\r\nand bombastic, but the final effect, even upon Weissmann, was that of\r\none deluded, rather than of one carrying on a deep and far-reaching\r\nsystem of deception. He bodied forth the emotional moralist seeking\r\nescape from the ferocity of the creed in which his youth had been\r\nnurtured, rather than the self-seeking, coldly calculating\r\nfortune-hunter. With lofty courage he concluded:\r\n\r\n\"Now to you, gentlemen of science, we say: We respect your methods,\r\nbut not your subjects of study. Nothing gives me greater pleasure than\r\na perusal of your books. The patient way in which you pursue some clew\r\nin the labyrinth of biology is admirable. I met a man last week--a man\r\nI knew in college--and upon my asking what he was doing he replied,\r\ngravely, 'For the last six months I've been making a study of the\r\nparasites in the abdomen of the flea!'\" Here Clarke's sneering laugh\r\nbroke out. \"Yet that man despised me--called me a fool--because I,\r\nforsooth, was intent on the laws which govern the return of the dead.\"\r\nHis laugh died, he became very earnest and very sincere. \"Now, men of\r\nscience, all we ask of you is to apply your precision of handling to\r\nsubjects a little more worth while than the putrid body of an\r\ninsect.\"\r\n\r\nServiss laughed, but Weissmann, with true German contrariety, returned\r\nthe compliment gravely. Being confronted with a true believer, he\r\nautomatically assumed the opposite position, and with searching scorn\r\nassailed the whole spiritist camp with merciless knowledge of every\r\ndefenceless portal.\r\n\r\nFor a time Morton enjoyed Clarke's discomfiture, but at last his sense\r\nof duty as host awoke and he was about to come to the preacher's\r\nrelief when Kate appeared in the doorway, and the old warrior lowered\r\nhis lance and rose politely.\r\n\r\nKate gave him a reproving glance. \"You've been arguing--I can tell by\r\nyour guilty looks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, not at all; a mere statement of opinion--of no interest, I\r\nassure you.\"\r\n\r\nKate's voice was eager. \"Mr. Clarke, Viola wants to sit for us--have\r\nyou any objections?\"\r\n\r\n\"Kate!\" called Serviss. \"I am ashamed of you--\"\r\n\r\n\"I assure you I didn't ask it--I didn't even hint towards it. 'Cross\r\nmy heart--hope to die.'\"\r\n\r\nMorton was at the moment displeased, for he had been looking forward\r\nto a long and intimate conversation with Viola in the drawing-room,\r\nand would have been glad if Clarke had opposed it firmly--which he did\r\nnot. Perhaps he saw a chance to turn the tables on his critics; at any\r\nrate, he rose, saying, \"I will talk with her and decide the matter,\"\r\nand followed Kate out of the room.\r\n\r\n\"What is it? What did she say?\" queried Weissmann, bewilderedly.\r\n\r\nMorton explained that Miss Lambert had particularly requested him to\r\nsit with her and talk to her \"guides,\" and that she had expressed a\r\nparticular desire for an immediate test.\r\n\r\nWeissmann's eyes glittered with new interest. \"Very good. Why not? It\r\nis a fine opportunity. Do you not feel so?\"\r\n\r\nIn truth he did not. The intrusion of the abnormal side of Viola's\r\nlife seemed at the moment not merely inopportune but repulsive. As he\r\nentered the drawing-room he found her sitting in a low chair beside a\r\nsmall table on which stood a shaded lamp. Clarke was talking with her,\r\nand Serviss could detect even at a distance the depressing change\r\nwhich had come to her. Her girlish ecstasy was quite gone and in its\r\nplace lay pallid languor and a look of appeal.\r\n\r\nClarke moved away as his host approached, and Viola, glancing up wanly\r\nand wistfully, said: \"Isn't it stupid? Just when I was so happy. I\r\nwanted this evening free, but they would not have it so. No sooner was\r\nI seated here than they began to work on me. They say they want to\r\ntalk with you--my grandfather especially--and I, too, want you to do\r\nso--only I didn't intend to ask it to-night. Please be patient with\r\nme, won't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not distress yourself about that. I shall be very glad to sit. I\r\nwas afraid Kate might be requesting it. I particularly warned her\r\nagainst mentioning the subject, but if your 'guides' wish it, and you\r\nare willing, be sure Dr. Weissmann and I will be most pleased. But,\r\ntell me, how did the change come? What began to happen?\"\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: \"'BUT, TELL ME, HOW DID THE CHANGE COME? WHAT\r\n   BEGAN TO HAPPEN?'\"]\r\n\r\n\"The usual tapping--here on the table--then my hand wanted to write. I\r\nignored it--I fought it. I didn't intend to yield, but they set to\r\nwork undermining my will, and then I knew that I must consent or be\r\nstrangled. As soon as I gave up they took their fingers from my\r\nthroat, but they are here--my grandfather is just back of me--I can\r\nfeel his heavy hand on my head. I'm sorry, Professor Serviss. I was\r\nhaving such a good time. I hope you won't despise me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are entirely too modest,\" he answered, cheerily. \"We are highly\r\nfavored. It's like having Paderewski volunteer to play for his\r\ndinner.\"\r\n\r\nHis lightness of tone hurt her a little. \"You don't believe in me in\r\nthe least, do you? You think I am an impostor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no. I believe in _you_.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you've got to believe in these manifestations if you believe in\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, that does not follow,\" he replied, quickly; then, perceiving\r\nthat this involved him, \"All you do may possibly be explained without\r\nresort to the spiritualistic hypothesis--\" He was embarrassed by her\r\ngaze.\r\n\r\n\"Why are you so contemptuous of spiritualists? It is very hard to\r\nbear.\"\r\n\r\nHe felt the rebuke. \"I am not contemptuous--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you are. Scientific people never speak of us without a laugh or\r\na sneer, and it hurts. It confuses me, too. If good people like you\r\ncare nothing about death--if you only laugh--\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, Miss Lambert, I never intended to be either harsh\r\nor contemptuous. I do not accept--I mean to say I am _unable_ to\r\naccept--your faith. I confess that my mind refuses to entertain the\r\npostulates of what Clarke considers a religion. I must be honest. I am\r\na 'sceptic,' so far as your faith goes, but that does not mean that I\r\ndo not believe in the sincerity of your mother; and as to your own\r\npowers--I do not wish to dogmatize, for the physical universe is a\r\nvery large and complicate thing, and, young as I am\"--here he\r\nsmiled--\"I don't pretend to a knowledge of all it contains.\"\r\n\r\nShe accepted his explanation, and, with musing candor, replied: \"I\r\ndon't really blame you. I suppose if these things had happened to some\r\none else I would not have believed in them. I have thought a great\r\ndeal of what you said to me. I want to get away from that house; I am\r\nhating Mr. Pratt more and more, and I will leave to-morrow if\r\ngrandfather will only consent. If he comes to you to-night, tell him\r\nso--maybe my father will come, too. I want you to know my father. I'm\r\nsure you will like him. Isn't it strange that I have never been able\r\nto hear his voice?\"\r\n\r\nHe ignored her question. \"I do not understand the motives of your\r\n'guides'--I cannot conceive of myself sacrificing you to any cause\r\nwhatsoever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't awaken my doubts,\" she cried, despairingly. \"I don't know why\r\nit is, but you always rouse in me something that makes war.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry if I seem to corrupt you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't mean that,\" she hastened to say. \"The life which you and your\r\nsister represent is the life I love. I was almost resigned to my fate\r\nwhen your sister called upon me. Now I'm all rebellion again. Being\r\nhere to-night makes me hate all that I am. I hate my very name. I hate\r\nPratt and his horrible house--I almost hate my mother. Sometimes she\r\nis so cruel to me. She don't mean to be, but she is.\"\r\n\r\nHis face grew reflective, almost stern. \"I wish there were some way of\r\ntaking you out of the world in which you now suffer. I wish--\" He\r\npaused, checked by the thought of Clarke's claims upon her.\r\n\r\n\"There is only one way--my grandfather must consent to my release; he\r\nrules us all.\"\r\n\r\nThis delusion rose like a stone wall at the end of every avenue, and\r\nMorton turned to a personal explanation. \"I cannot associate what you\r\nseem to me now with what you were when I last saw you. What would you\r\nhave said had I seized you the other day--snatched you from the stairs\r\nand ran--\"\r\n\r\nHer eyes opened wide. \"The stairs?\"\r\n\r\n\"Had you no knowledge of following your mother down the stairway after\r\nour interview?\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew I was entranced, but I didn't know--What did I do?\" She asked\r\nthis anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing.\" He hastened again to change the current. \"We were in hot\r\nargument. You came down as peace-maker. I went away cravenly, most\r\nimpotently, leaving you there like a captive.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't remember a word of it. I came to myself in my own room, and\r\nonly mother was with me.\" Her rebellious fire blazed up again. \"Oh,\r\nDr. Serviss, I was resigned yesterday, but to-night I am in terror\r\nagain, and they know it. They are eager to show their power, to\r\nconfound you and convert Dr. Weissmann. I'm sure they will do some\r\nwonderful thing for you to-night if you will let them.\"\r\n\r\n\"The best thing 'they' could do for me would be to let you sit and\r\ntalk to me,\" he replied in the voice of a lover.\r\n\r\nShe seemed to listen to some interior voice. \"They are insisting. They\r\nare here--listen!\"\r\n\r\nAs he listened a series of throbbing raps seemed to come from the\r\nchair beneath her hand.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, we will sit.\" As he said this three heavy, rending, low\r\nthuds sounded on the under side of the table.\r\n\r\n\"That is grandfather,\" she said. \"He wants you to be very rigid, and\r\nso do I,\" she said. \"Sometimes it seems as if I did these things\r\nmyself--I mean certain physical things--and I get all mixed in my\r\nmind. I want you to study me.\" She passed her hand wearily over her\r\nface, and Morton looked at her in sorrow, meditating a firm, decisive\r\nassault on her hallucination, but checked himself. \"If I am to help\r\nyou, I must know all about you,\" he said at last, \"and a sitting may\r\nhelp.\"\r\n\r\n\"You wonder at my fear of my grandfather, but that's because you don't\r\nrealize his power. Let me tell you what happened to me once, when I\r\ntried to run away from him. I became desperate one summer vacation and\r\ndetermined to get away from it all. Without telling mother, I took the\r\ntrain one morning--\" She paused abruptly and pressed both hands to her\r\nburning cheeks. \"Oh, it was horrible! My grandfather threw me into a\r\ntrance on the train, and the conductor thought I was drunk--\" She\r\nshuddered with the memory of it, and could not finish. \"Since then I\r\nhave never dared to really oppose him.\"\r\n\r\nHe pondered her blush, the quiver of her lips, and the timid look of\r\nher eyes, and gravely answered: \"I share your horror of an experience\r\nlike that. But it does not endear your malevolent grandfather to me.\r\nHe must be a kind of male witch--\"\r\n\r\n\"You mustn't feel that way towards him,\" she cried out in some alarm.\r\n\"He is firm because he feels that I should be doing my work--\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to talk this matter over with him, but I don't like to have\r\nyou entranced. Is that necessary?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, to get the voices. The writing we can have any time.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you do to induce this coma--this sleep?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just fold my hands and give myself up.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems a desecration of you; but if there is no other way we will\r\ngrant 'the powers' audience.\"\r\n\r\nAt his word her face cleared, her fingers relaxed, and she smiled.\r\n\"Thank you. He has taken away his hand.\"\r\n\r\nAs she rose and stood before him she seemed again the buoyant,\r\ncare-free girl, and he could only weakly say, \"It seems so ungracious,\r\nso inhospitable in us,\" as they walked side by side across the room to\r\nKate.\r\n\r\nClarke was sitting in silence, without pretence of listening to his\r\nhostess, watching Serviss with gloomy, uneasy eyes--a fierce flame of\r\njealousy burning in his brain. He recalled the change in Viola which\r\nhad followed this man's visit to Colorow, and associated her first\r\npersistent revolt with him; and now, seeing her beside him, in his own\r\nhouse, looking up into his face, absorbed, fascinated, utterly\r\nforgetful of her duty, oblivious to every one else, was maddening. Her\r\ngown angered him. \"Why did she wear that dress?\" he fiercely asked\r\nhimself. \"She does not do that for me. She is in love with him--that\r\nis why. She shall not come here again. These people are destructive to\r\nher higher aims.\"\r\n\r\nIn this mood he changed his mind, opposed the sitting; but Viola\r\nconvinced him that it was the will of her 'guides' and that it was a\r\nsplendid opportunity to interest two renowned sceptics, and in that\r\nspirit he again reluctantly consented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nTHE TEST SÉANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nMorton's study was decided upon as the most suitable place in which to\r\nexperiment, for the reason that it had but one exit, a sliding double\r\ndoor, which led to the library, and its windows all opened upon the\r\nstreet, six stories below. A burglar could not have entered with full\r\nlicense to do so.\r\n\r\nViola assisted Morton and Kate in clearing the big mahogany table,\r\nwhile Weissmann conferred with Clarke. To judge from the girl's gayety\r\nand eager interest the preparations were for a game of cards rather\r\nthan for a test séance in which her love and honor were at stake. Mrs.\r\nLambert was quite serene; Clarke alone seemed anxious and ill at ease.\r\n\r\nWeissmann, at Morton's request, assumed general direction, and\r\nbetrayed an astonishing familiarity with the requirements. Under his\r\ndirection they grouped themselves about the table as for whist, Viola\r\nat the north end, with Clarke directly opposite, and Kate and Mrs.\r\nLambert on either side and quite near him. The two inquisitors then\r\ntook seats--Morton at the psychic's right, Weissmann at her left.\r\n\r\nWhen the positions were all decided upon, Viola, with a note of\r\ndisappointment in her voice, asked, \"Aren't you going to tie me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no,\" replied Morton, \"the conditions are yours to-night. You are\r\nour guest. Our tests will be made at some other time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please make them to-night,\" she pleaded. \"Please make them as hard as\r\nyou can.\"\r\n\r\nWeissmann's glasses glistened upon her with joyful acclaim. \"Very\r\ngood, your wishes shall be met. Let us see--we shall tie you. Have you\r\nsomething suitable?\" he asked of his assistant.\r\n\r\nMorton took from his desk a roll of white tape. \"How will this do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just the thing,\" Weissmann replied; \"but we must have no knots, no\r\ntying. Kate, get your needle, we must fasten Miss Lambert in such wise\r\nthat no one can say, 'Oh, she untied the knots!'\"\r\n\r\nUnder his supervision Kate looped the tape about Viola's wrists and\r\nsewed it fast to her close-fitting satin cuffs. She then encircled her\r\nankles with the tape, and Morton drew the long ends under and far back\r\nof the chair and nailed them to the floor. Thereupon Weissmann said,\r\n\"I wish to nail these wristbands to the chair-arm.--Do we sacrifice\r\nthe cuffs?\" he asked of Viola.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes--anything. Nail as hard as you please.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the chair?\" pursued the old man, glancing at Morton.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, certainly,\" replied he. \"Science goes before furniture in this\r\nhouse,\" and a couple of long brass tacks were driven firmly down\r\nthrough both tape and sleeve.\r\n\r\n\"You poor child!\" exclaimed Kate. \"If they hurt you, cry out, and I\r\nwill free you.\"\r\n\r\nWeissmann then fastened a silk thread to her wrist and gave one end to\r\nMorton. \"We will keep this taut,\" he said; \"every motion will be\r\nfelt.\"\r\n\r\nAs they worked the enthusiasm of investigation filled their eyes. They\r\nlost sight of the fact that all this precaution implied a doubt of the\r\ngirl, and Viola on her part remained as blithe as if it were all a\r\ngame of hide-and-seek.\r\n\r\nClarke, too, became exultant. \"McLeod, now is your opportunity,\" he\r\ncalled to the invisible guide. \"Bring your band and put the monist\r\nbigots to rout.\"\r\n\r\nMorton moved about the girl with growing excitement, a subtle fire\r\nmounting to his brain each time his fingers touched her smooth, round\r\nwrists. Once she said, \"I have never had a real test like this--this\r\nis what I wanted you to do. If anything happens now it will be outside\r\nof me, won't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"We must be cruel in order to be kind,\" he answered, enigmatically.\r\n\r\nAt last Weissmann stood clear of her. \"Now we are ready,\" he said,\r\nbeaming with satisfaction. \"You see I lock this door and here is the\r\nkey.\" He held it up in confirmation. \"I pocket the key. Now what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Turn down the gas,\" replied Clarke. \"Do not use electricity--the room\r\nmust be perfectly dark.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why _perfectly_ dark? I don't like that.\" Weissmann spoke with\r\nmanifest irritation. \"We should be able to see something.\"\r\n\r\nClarke shrugged his shoulders. \"You can do as you wish. The guides say\r\ntheir manifestations are antagonized by light--and that darkness is\r\nnecessary for these special phenomena of the cone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we _have_ no cone!\" exclaimed Mrs. Lambert.\r\n\r\n\"Cone? What cone?\" asked Weissmann.\r\n\r\n\"We need some sort of megaphone to enlarge the spirit-voices.\"\r\n\r\n\"Make one of card-board,\" suggested Viola. \"Any sort of horn will do.\"\r\n\r\nMorton rose and took down a horn from the top of a bookcase. \"Here is\r\nthe megaphone of my phonograph; will it do?\"\r\n\r\nClarke examined it. \"It's rather heavy, but I think they will use it.\r\nPlace it on the table. Put a pad and pencil there also,\" he added. \"We\r\nmay get some writing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anything else?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--now we are quite ready,\" replied Clarke, in his exhibition voice.\r\n\"It is well to touch hands for a time--until the psychic sinks into\r\nher trance.\"\r\n\r\n\"With your permission,\" said Morton to Viola.\r\n\r\nA faint flush came into her face. \"Certainly, professor,\" and a touch\r\nof emphasis on his title had the effect of a slight, a very slight\r\nrebuff.\r\n\r\nClarke turned the light down to a mere point of yellow fire, and in\r\nthe sudden gloom all were plunged into silence. \"Now, whatever you\r\ndo, gentlemen, don't startle the psychic after she goes into sleep.\"\r\n\r\nMorton, with his fingers resting lightly on Viola's soft hand,\r\nexperienced a keen, pang of sympathetic pain. \"She is so charming!\r\nWhat profanation to develop the seamy side of her nature! What pitiful\r\ntomfoolery! She is in the lion's mouth now--and yet how eagerly she\r\nseemed to desire it. Weissmann has made anything but the simplest\r\nventriloquistic performance impossible--she cannot lift a hand. To\r\nsave her from herself, as well as from Clarke, it is necessary to\r\nexpose her weakness as well as his trickery.\"\r\n\r\nShe was saying, in answer to a question: \"No, Dr. Weissmann, I have no\r\ncontrol over the manifestations; in fact, the more anxious I am, the\r\nlonger we have to wait. I cannot promise anything to-night--\"\r\n\r\nMorton, hearing this, inwardly commented; \"These obscure forms of\r\nhysteria often possess the cunning, the dissimulation of madness. Poor\r\ngirl! She is beginning to realize her predicament, and is preparing us\r\nfor disappointment,\" and a return of his doubt kept him silent.\r\n\r\nWeissmann spoke. \"Shall we not sing something--'We Shall Meet Beyond\r\nthe River,' or some ditty like that?\"\r\n\r\nThereat Kate said: \"Doctor, you betray astonishing familiarity with\r\nthe ways of 'spooks.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I know everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"I begin to believe it,\" she retorted. \"I begin to suspect that you\r\nare a secret adherent. Morton, you would better tie Dr. Weissmann,\r\notherwise he may speak from the cone himself.\"\r\n\r\nAs if to counteract this banter Clarke began a discourse on the\r\nleadings of the most recent discoveries:\r\n\r\n\"The X-ray is a mode of motion, as light is a mode of motion, but the\r\nwaves of light move in such a way as to clash with and weaken those of\r\nthe X-ray; so we argue that the mode of motion, through which\r\ndisembodied souls manifest themselves, being far subtler than the\r\nX-ray, is neutralized--though by no means destroyed--by the motion\r\ncalled light. Furthermore, there seems to be a reluctance on the part\r\nof the invisible ones to have the actual processes scrutinized. I once\r\nlaid a pencil on the table and asked for a visible action of writing,\r\nvainly, so long as it was completely exposed, but upon being covered\r\nwith a silk handkerchief it plainly rose and wrote. It could be\r\ndistinctly seen moving beneath the cloth. Sir William Crookes had a\r\nsimilar experience, except in his case he saw the pencil move, prop\r\nitself against a ruler, and try three times to write--all in the\r\nlight. I have seen letters form on an exposed surface of a slate, I\r\nhave had hands appear through a curtain and write in the light, but\r\nthe power must always be generated in shadow.\"\r\n\r\nKate shuddered. \"Woo! It gives me the shivers to think of such things.\r\nWill anything as wonderful happen to-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot tell--the conditions are severe, but I think we will have\r\nsomething. Viola?\" he called, softly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she answered, faintly.\r\n\r\n\"Would you like us to sing?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--I'd rather you'd all talk. Perhaps they will let me take part in\r\nthe demonstration to-night. They promised to do so, you remember.\"\r\n\r\nWeissman recounted some of the experiences Zöllner had enjoyed in\r\nGermany shortly after the Fox sisters became so celebrated in America.\r\n\"Crookes and Wallace and several others went into the whole question\r\nat that time--the world rang with the controversy. But the clamor\r\npassed, the phenomena passed. It is like an epidemic, it comes and it\r\ngoes, and in the end is humanity the wiser? No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is,\" broke in Clarke. \"We are just that much more certain of\r\nthe indestructible life of the soul--every wave of this spirit-sea\r\nleaves a deposit of fact on the beach of time, makes death that much\r\nless dreadful. We make gains each decade. Sir William Crookes, Sir\r\nOliver Lodge, Alfred Russel Wallace, Lombroso have all been convinced\r\nof the reality of these phenomena. Surely such men must influence the\r\nthought of their time. Experimental psychology is on the right road--\"\r\n\r\nMorton was suffering with the girl, whose hand was beginning to\r\ntremble beneath his palm. She no longer replied to his questions, but\r\nthat she was still awake he knew, for he could hear her sighing\r\ndeeply, so deeply that the sound troubled him almost as if she were\r\nweeping. His impulse was to rise and turn on the light and give over\r\nthis trial, which could only end in humiliating her. \"Her temerity is\r\na part of her malady,\" he argued. \"It has arisen through years of\r\nmisconceived petting and nursing on the part of her mother. Up to this\r\nmoment her performances have always been in the presence of friends\r\nand relatives, or for the consolation of those eager to believe, and\r\ntherefore easily deluded. Every sitter has conspired to practically\r\nforce her into an elaborate series of deceptions, each deceit being\r\nbuilt upon and made necessary by the other. It is pitiful, but she now\r\nbelieves in herself--that is pathetically certain. Otherwise she would\r\nnot have yielded herself so completely into the hands of an inexorable\r\ninvestigator like Weissmann. She must take the consequences,\" he\r\nended, with grim closing of the lips. \"We must be cruel in order to be\r\nkind. This night may be her salvation.\"\r\n\r\nWeissmann was replying to Mrs. Lambert. \"I do not care for a return of\r\nmy dead, madam; what I wish your daughter to do is quite simple. I\r\nwould like her to move a particle of matter from A to B, without a\r\nknown push or a pull--that is to say, by a power not known to\r\nscience--as Zöllner claimed Slade was able to do for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"She can do it,\" cried Clarke. \"She can move a chair from A to B\r\nwithout bringing to bear any of the known forces. She can suspend the\r\nlaw of gravity. She can make a closed piano play, and she can read\r\nsealed letters in an ebony box tightly closed and locked.\"\r\n\r\n\"You claim too much, my friend,\" replied Weissmann, ironically. \"We\r\nshall be satisfied with much less. If she will change one\r\none-hundredth part of a grain from one scale to another, under my\r\nconditions, I will be satisfied. The most wonderful phenomena taking\r\nplace in the dark have no value to me.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lambert interposed. \"Please don't argue--it prevents the coming\r\nof the spirits.\"\r\n\r\nBoth men felt rebuked and the group again settled into silence.\r\nSuddenly, Kate began to laugh, \"Isn't it childish? Really, Morton, if\r\nour friends could see us sitting around here in the dark, as we are\r\nnow, they would roar. Why should it all be so silly, Mr. Clarke?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is _not_ silly if we take the right view. We must sit together in\r\norder to get into harmony. We further these conditions by sitting in\r\nsubdued light with fingers touching. Song adds still more to this\r\nconcert of thought. Nothing is really silly or prosaic--all depends\r\nupon the minds of those--\"\r\n\r\nHe was in the midst of an elaborate defence of spirit methods when\r\nViola's hand began to leap as if struggling to be free. She moaned and\r\nsighed and writhed so powerfully that her chair creaked. \"Oh, dear!\r\nOh, dear!\" she cried, gaspingly.\r\n\r\n\"Is she trying to free her hands?\" Morton asked himself, with roused\r\nsuspicion. \"Is this a ruse to cover some trick?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lambert spoke quietly. \"She is going! Sing something, Anthony.\"\r\n\r\nClarke began to hum a monotonous tune, while Morton, bending towards\r\nthe girl, listened to her gurgling moans with growing heartache. \"She\r\nseems in great pain, Mrs. Lambert. Don't you think we'd better release\r\nher? I do not care to purchase sensation so clearly at her expense.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be alarmed, she always seems to suffer that way when some great\r\nmanifestation is about to take place.\"\r\n\r\nThe poor girl's outcries so nearly resembled those of a death struggle\r\nthat Kate at last rose. \"Turn up that light! She is being strangled!\"\r\n\r\n\"Please be silent!\" said Clarke, almost angrily. \"Take your hands from\r\nher, gentlemen! You are too 'strong'--and do not startle her! Be quiet\r\neverybody!\"\r\n\r\nMorton took his hand away in anger and disgust. \"All this is a ruse to\r\nweaken our grasp upon her,\" he thought. \"Even the mother, so serene,\r\nso candid, is aiding the deception.\"\r\n\r\n\"Things will happen now,\" remarked Mrs. Lambert, confidently; \"she is\r\ngiving herself up at last.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl drew a long, deep, peaceful sigh, and became silent, so\r\nsilent that Morton, leaning far over, with suspended breath, his ear\r\nalmost to her lips, could detect no sound, no slightest movement, and\r\nlistening thus he had for an instant a singular vision of her. He\r\nseemed to see her laughing silently at him from a distant upper corner\r\nof the room, and for the moment secured a glimpse into a new and\r\namazing world--the world of darkness and silence wherein matter was\r\nfluid, imponderable, an insubstantial world peopled, nevertheless,\r\nwith rustling, busy souls.\r\n\r\nA sharp rapping began on the cone, a measured beat, which ended in a\r\nclang, which startled Kate into a shriek. \"Who is doing that?\" she\r\nasked, nervously.\r\n\r\n\"They are here,\" Clarke solemnly announced.\r\n\r\n\"Is that you, Waltie?\" asked Mrs. Lambert, sweetly.\r\n\r\nThree raps, loud and clear, answered \"yes.\" A drumming on the cone\r\nfollowed, and Mrs. Lambert, her voice full of maternal pride,\r\nremarked: \"Waltie is the life of our sittings--he's _such_ a rogue!\r\nYou must be a nice boy to-night--on account of these very\r\ndistinguished men.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rap, rap!\" went the cone.\r\n\r\n\"Does that mean 'all right'?\"\r\n\r\n\"Rap, rap, rap!\" Yes.\r\n\r\n\"Is grandfather there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does he wish to speak to the gentlemen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are we sitting right?\"\r\n\r\nA decided thump--\"No.\"\r\n\r\nGuided by the rapping Mrs. Lambert and Kate moved down to the foot of\r\nthe table, sitting close beside Clarke, thus leaving Morton and\r\nWeissmann alone with the sleeping girl. No sooner were they rearranged\r\nthan the table began to move, precisely as though pushed by the girl's\r\nfeet. Still guided by the rapping, Weissmann and Morton moved with the\r\ntable, but retained their threads of silk. Morton's pity had given\r\nplace to a feeling of resentment at this device to get them farther\r\naway, and he drew his tell-tale thread tight across his finger. \"If\r\nshe moves she is betrayed,\" he thought with hardening heart.\r\n\r\nNo sooner were they settled than a fumbling sound began in the middle\r\nof the table, and the pencil was twice lifted and dropped. Following\r\nthis the leaves of the writing-pad rustled as though being thumbed by\r\nboyish hands.\r\n\r\nKate shivered and cried out: \"This is uncanny! Morton, are you doing\r\nthis?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not,\" he replied, curtly.\r\n\r\n\"Do you feel any motion in your thread?\" asked Weissmann, in a quiet\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"None whatever,\" Morton replied.\r\n\r\n\"Then the psychic is not moving.\"\r\n\r\nAgain they sat in silence, and after some minutes the fumbling began\r\nagain and the horn was heard scraping slowly about, as if being lifted\r\nwith effort only to fall back with a clang.\r\n\r\n\"Is it too heavy?\" asked Clarke.\r\n\r\nThree sharp raps replied--an angry \"yes\"--and then, with a petulant\r\nswing, the instrument apparently left the table and floated upon the\r\nair. In deep amazement Morton listened for some movement, some sound\r\nfrom Viola, but there was none, not a breath, not a rustle of motion\r\nwhere she sat, and the silk thread was tight and calm. \"She has\r\nnothing to do with _that_,\" he said, beneath his breath.\r\n\r\nKate called excitedly, \"Oh! It touched me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What touched you?\" asked Weissmann.\r\n\r\n\"The horn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did it bump you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it seemed to float against me.\"\r\n\r\nMorton spoke out sharply: \"Where is Mr. Clarke?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right here on my right,\" replied Kate.\r\n\r\n\"What idiotic business!\" he exclaimed, mystified, nevertheless.\r\n\r\nThe horn dropped to the middle of the table, but was immediately swept\r\ninto the air again as if by a new and more vigorous hand, and a voice\r\nheavily mixed with air, but a man's voice unmistakably, spoke directly\r\nto Morton, sternly, contemptuously.\r\n\r\n\"We meet you on your own level. You asked for material tests, and now\r\nconditions being as you have made them--proceed. What would you have\r\nus do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am Donald McLeod--grandfather to the psychic.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment Morton became seized of the most vivid realization of\r\nthe physical characteristics of the man back of the voice. In some\r\nmysterious way, through some hitherto unknown sense, he was aware of a\r\nlong, rugged face, with bleak and knobby brow. The lips were thin, the\r\nmouth wide, the dark-gray eyes contemptuous. \"It is all an inner\r\ndelusion caused by some resemblance of this voice to that of some one\r\nI have known,\" he said to himself; but a shiver ran over him as he\r\nquestioned the old man. \"If you are the grandfather of the psychic,\"\r\nhe said, \"I would like to ask you if you think it fair to a young girl\r\nto use her against her will for such foolery as this?\"\r\n\r\n\"The purposes are grand, the work she is doing important--therefore I\r\nanswer yes. She is yet but a child, and the things she does of her own\r\nmotion trivial and vain. We make of her an instrument that will enable\r\nman to triumph over the grave. You will observe that we do not harm\r\nher, we take but little of her time, after all. You are unnecessarily\r\nalarmed. Our regard for her welfare far exceeds yours. Her troubles\r\narise from her resistance. If she would yield herself entirely, she\r\nwould be happy.\"\r\n\r\nAs the voice paused, Morton asked, \"Weissmann, can you hear what is\r\nbeing said to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very indistinctly,\" answered Weissmann.\r\n\r\n\"What does it say?\" asked Kate. \"I can only hear a kind of jumble.\"\r\n\r\nWeissmann interjected; \"I must ask you, Mrs. Rice, have you tight hold\r\nof Mr. Clarke's hand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Kate.\r\n\r\nMorton's brain whirled in confusion and conjecture. He believed the\r\nwhole thing to be a piece of juggling, and yet he could not connect\r\nViola in any way with it, and it seemed impossible, also, for Mrs.\r\nLambert to sit where she was and handle the cone, to say nothing of\r\nthe ventriloquistic skill necessary to carry on this conversation. He\r\nagain addressed the voice: \"You consider your control of the psychic\r\nto be justified?\"\r\n\r\n\"We do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, also, what perilous notoriety, what positive\r\ndisgrace--from every human point of view--you are about to bring upon\r\nher?\"\r\n\r\nThe hidden old man pondered a moment, as if to master a profound\r\ncontempt, then answered: \"We have taken all things into account. When\r\nshe has grown to years of sobriety she will thank us that we turned\r\nher aside from dancing and from light conversation, and from all\r\nloose-minded companions. All the sane pleasures are now hers. She is\r\nsoon to be idolized by thousands. Her playing on the piano, her\r\nsinging are as the rustle of leaves in the forest compared to her\r\nmediumship, which is as a trumpet-blast opening the gates of the city\r\nof refuge to let the weary traveller in.\" The voice weakened a little.\r\n\"The earth-life is but a school--the real life is here. Besides, when\r\nshe has completely subordinated her will to ours, when she has given\r\nour message--\" The spirit grand-sire seemed to falter and diminish.\r\n\"My power is waning, but I will again manifest. We will try--\" The\r\nvoice stopped as though a door had been shut upon the speaker, and the\r\nmegaphone dropped upon the table.\r\n\r\n\"All that is very interesting,\" commented Weissmann, \"but\r\ninconclusive. Is it all over?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no,\" answered Mrs. Lambert. \"They are uniting upon something\r\nwonderful--I feel it.\"\r\n\r\nAs they listened the horn moved feebly, uneasily rising a few inches,\r\nonly to fall as though some weak hand were struggling with it; but at\r\nlast it turned towards Weissmann, and from it issued the voice of a\r\nlittle girl, thrillingly sweet and so clear that Serviss could hear\r\nevery word. She addressed Weissmann in German, calling him father,\r\nasking him to tell mother not to grieve, that they would soon all be\r\ntogether in a bright land.\r\n\r\nTo this Weissmann replied in harsh accent: \"You assert you are my\r\ndaughter?\"\r\n\r\nThe voice sweetly answered: \"Yes, I am Mina--\"\r\n\r\n\"But Mina could not understand a word of English--how is that?\"\r\n\r\nThe little voice hesitated. \"It is hard to explain,\" she replied,\r\nstill in German. \"I can _understand_ you in any language--but I can\r\nonly speak as you taught me.\"\r\n\r\nThereupon he addressed her in French, to which she replied easily, but\r\nin her native tongue.\r\n\r\nAs this curious dialogue went on Serviss was searching vainly for an\r\nexplanation. \"Mr. Clarke, will you kindly speak at the same time that\r\nthis voice appears?\"\r\n\r\nClarke began a discourse, and the two voices went on at the same time.\r\nThe young scientist then said: \"Mrs. Lambert, will you permit Kate to\r\nlay her hand over your lips? You understand, it is for the sake of\r\nscience--\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said Mrs. Lambert.\r\n\r\nHere the test failed of completeness, it was so difficult to get the\r\nthree voices precisely together; but at last it seemed that the\r\nchild's voice was produced at the same time that Clarke spoke and\r\nwhile Kate's hand covered the mother's mouth.\r\n\r\nThereupon the little voice said farewell, and all was silent for a few\r\nmoments. The cone rose again into the air and a soft, sibilant voice\r\naddressed Mrs. Lambert.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" she cried, joyfully. \"It is Robert!--Yes, dear, I'm listening.\r\nI'm so glad you've come. Can't you talk with Professor Serviss?--He\r\nsays he will try,\" she said to the company.\r\n\r\nAs Morton waited the cone gently touched him on the shoulder, and a\r\nmoment later a man's voice, utterly different from the first one and\r\nof most refined accent, half spoke, half whispered: \"We are glad to\r\nmeet you, professor. I am deeply gratified by your interest in our\r\ndear girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" he asked, moved, in spite of himself, by a liking for\r\nthis new personality, so distinct from the others.\r\n\r\n\"I am R.M. Waldron--Viola's father.\"\r\n\r\nHe seemed to wait for questions, and Serviss asked: \"How do _you_ feel\r\nabout your daughter's mediumship? Are you not uneasy when you think of\r\nwhat you are demanding of her?\"\r\n\r\nThe invisible one sighed, hesitated, and replied with evident sadness:\r\n\"It troubles me to find her reluctant. I wish she were happier in the\r\nwork. It seems so important to us.\" Then the voice brightened. \"But\r\nperhaps it is only for a little while. After the public test--after\r\nthe truth of her mediumship is made manifest--I think, I hope, we will\r\nask less of her. Perhaps it will be possible to release her altogether\r\nfor a time; but for the present she is too valuable--\" The sentence\r\nwas lost in a buzz of inarticulate whispering, as if two or three\r\nfriends were consulting. The opening and closing of lips could be\r\nheard, and a stir within the horn was curiously trivial in effect, as\r\nif a mouse were at play with a dry leaf.\r\n\r\n\"If I were to organize a committee of men like Weissmann and Tolman,\r\nand other men of international fame, willing to test your daughter's\r\npowers, will you give over this public demonstration--this publishing\r\nof a challenge?\"\r\n\r\nClarke interrupted almost angrily. \"Not unless you promise to--\"\r\n\r\n\"Be silent!\" commanded Weissmann.\r\n\r\nFrom the horn came a faint murmur, so dim, so far, Serviss could, with\r\ndifficulty, distinguish the words. \"We will consider that. I am going.\r\nGuard my girl. Good-bye.\"\r\n\r\nThe horn, again seemed to rest, and for a long time no sound or stir\r\nbroke the silence, till at last Viola began to writhe in her chair in\r\ngreater agony than before.\r\n\r\n\"I think she is waking,\" said Morton.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lambert answered, quickly: \"No. Some great event is\r\npreparing--when this paroxysm passes some very beautiful test will\r\ncome.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Morton and Weissmann were considering this the girl again became\r\nsilent as a stone, and a moment later a clear, sweet sound pulsed\r\nthrough the air as if an exquisite crystal bell had been struck. Then,\r\nwhile still this signal trembled in his ear, a whispering noise\r\ndeveloped just before the young man's face, as if tremulous lips were\r\nclosing and unclosing in anxious effort to communicate a message\r\nwithout the use of the trumpet.\r\n\r\n\"Is some one trying to speak to me?\" he asked, gently.\r\n\r\nThree measured strokes upon, the tiny bell replied, and with their\r\npulsations the room seemed to stir with a new and different throng of\r\nwinged memories. The very air took on mystery and beauty and a sweet\r\ngravity. Matter was for the moment as subtle, as imponderable as soul.\r\n\r\n\"Who is it?\" he asked, and into his voice, in spite of himself, crept\r\na note of awe.\r\n\r\nThe answer came instantly, faint as the fall of an autumn leaf on the\r\ngrass.\r\n\r\n\"Mother.\"\r\n\r\nKate bent eagerly forward, \"Who was it, Morton?\"\r\n\r\nIgnoring her question Morton addressed the invisible one. \"Can't you\r\nspeak again?\"\r\n\r\nThere was no reply and the whispering ceased. Almost instantly the\r\nhorn seemed grasped by a firm and masterful hand, and the rollicking\r\nvoice of a man broke startlingly from the darkness in words so clear,\r\nso resonant, that all could hear them.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, folks. Is this a Quaker meeting?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" asked Morton.\r\n\r\n\"Can't you guess?\"\r\n\r\nKate gasped. \"Why, it's Uncle Ben Roberts!\"\r\n\r\nThe voice chuckled. \"Right the first time. It's old 'Loggy'--true\r\nbill. How are you all?\"\r\n\r\nKate could hardly speak, so great was her fear and joy. \"Morton\r\nServiss, what do you think now? Ask him--\"\r\n\r\nThe voice from the trumpet interposed. \"Don't ask me a word about\r\nconditions over here--it's no use. I can't tell you a thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" asked Morton.\r\n\r\n\"Well, how would you describe a Connecticut winter to a Hottentot? Not\r\nthat you're a Hottentot\"--the voice broke into an oily chuckle--\"or\r\nthat I'm in a cold climate.\" The chuckle was renewed. \"I'm very\r\ncomfortable, thank you.\" Here the invisible one grew tender. \"My boy,\r\nyour mother is here and wants to speak to you but can't do so. She\r\nasked me to manifest for her. She says to trust this girl and to carry\r\na message of love to Henry. I brought one of her colonial wineglasses\r\nwith me--as a sign of her presence and as a test of the power we have\r\nof passing through matter.\"\r\n\r\nFor nearly an hour this voice kept up a perfectly normal conversation\r\nwith a running fire of quips and cranks--recalling incidents in the\r\nlives of both Kate and Morton, arguing basic principles with Weissmann\r\nyet never quite replying to the most searching questions, and finally\r\nended by saying: \"Your conception of matter is childish. There is no\r\nsuch thing as you understand it, and yet the universe is not as Kant\r\nconceived it. As liberated spirits we move in an essence subtler than\r\nany matter known to you--ether is a gross thing compared to spirit.\r\nYour knowledge is merely rudimentary--but keep on. Take up this work\r\nand my band will meet you half-way. My boy, the question of the\r\npersistence of the individual after death is the most vital of all\r\nquestions. Apply your keen mind to it and depend on old 'Loggy.'\r\nGood-by!\"\r\n\r\nKate was quivering with excitement. \"Morton, that settles it for me.\r\nThat certainly was 'Loggy.' Oh, I wish mother could have spoken.\"\r\n\r\nMorton's voice was eager and penetrating as he said: \"Mrs. Lambert, I\r\nwould like to place my hand on your daughter's arm again, I must be\r\npermitted to demonstrate conclusively that she has had nothing to do\r\nwith the handling of the horn.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will ask the 'guides.' Father, can Professor Serviss--\"\r\n\r\nThree feeble raps anticipated her question.\r\n\r\n\"They say 'yes'--but they are very doubtful--so please be very\r\ngentle.\"\r\n\r\nServiss rose, his blood astir. At last he was about to remove his\r\ndoubt--or prove Viola's guilt. \"Doctor,\" he said, and his voice was\r\nincisive, \"take the other side and place a hand on her wrist. That\r\nwill be permitted?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nThree raps, very slow and soft, assented.\r\n\r\nClarke interposed. \"I am impressed, gentlemen, to say: Let each of you\r\nput one hand on the psychic's head, the other on her arm.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will do so,\" replied Weissmann, cheerfully.\r\n\r\nWith a full realization of the value of this supreme test of Viola's\r\nhonor, Morton laid his right hand lightly on her wrist. At the first\r\ncontact she started as though his fingers had been hot iron, and he\r\nwas unpleasantly aware that her flesh had grown cold and inert. He\r\nspoke of this to Weissmann, who replied: \"Is that so! The hand which I\r\nclasp is hot and dry, which is a singular symptom.\" Then to the\r\nothers: \"I am now holding both her hands. One is very hot, the other\r\ncold and damp and I feel no pulse.\"\r\n\r\n\"She is always so,\" Mrs. Lambert explained. \"She seems to die for the\r\ntime being.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is very strange,\" muttered Weissmann. \"May I listen for her\r\nheart-beat?\" Three raps assented, and a moment later he said, with\r\nincreased excitement: \"I cannot detect her heart-beat.\"\r\n\r\nClarke reassured him. \"Do not be alarmed. She is not dead. Proceed\r\nwith your experiment.\" There was a distinct note of contempt in his\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nAs Morton laid his hand upon the soft coils of her hair Viola again\r\nmoved slightly, as a sleeper stirs beneath a caress, disturbed yet not\r\ndistressed--to settle instantly into deeper dream.\r\n\r\n\"We are ready,\" called Weissmann. \"Whatever happens now Miss Lambert\r\nis not the cause. Take Mr. Clarke's hands in yours--\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Lambert's also,\" added Morton.\r\n\r\n\"Our hands are all touching,\" answered Kate.\r\n\r\n\"Now, let us see!\" cried Weissmann, and his voice rang triumphantly.\r\n\"Now, spirits, to your work!\"\r\n\r\nClarke laughed contemptuously. \"You scientists are very amusing. Your\r\nunbelief is heroic.\"\r\n\r\nAs they stood thus a powerful revulsion took place in Morton's mind,\r\nand with a painful constriction in his throat he bowed to the silent\r\ngirl, and with an inconsistency which he would not have published to\r\nthe world, he prayed that something might happen--not to demonstrate\r\nthe return of the dead but to prove her innocence.\r\n\r\nAs he waited the pencil began to tap on the table, and with its stir\r\nhis nerves took fire. A leaf of paper flew by, brushing his face like\r\nthe wing of a bird. A hand clutched his shoulder; then, as if to make\r\nevery explanation of no avail, the room filled with fairy unseen folk.\r\nBooks began to hurtle through the air and to fall upon the table. A\r\nbanjo on the wall was strummed. The entire library seemed crowded with\r\ntricksy pucks, a bustling, irresponsible, elfish crew, each on some\r\ninconsequential action bent; until, as if at a signal, the megaphone\r\ntumbled to the floor with a clang, and all was still--a silence\r\ndeathly deep, as if a bevy of sprites, frightened from their play, had\r\nwhirled upward and away, leaving the scene of their revels empty,\r\ndesolate, and forlorn.\r\n\r\n\"That is all,\" said Clarke.\r\n\r\n\"How can you tell?\" asked Kate, her voice faint and shrill with awe.\r\n\r\n\"The fall of the horn to the floor is a sure sign of the end. You may\r\nturn up the gas, but very slowly.\"\r\n\r\nStunned by the significance, the far-reaching implications of his\r\nexperiment, Morton remained standing while Weissmann turned on the\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nPale, in deep, placid sleep, Viola sat precisely as they had left her,\r\nbound, helpless, and exonerated. She recalled to Morton's mind a\r\npicture (in his school-books) of a martyr-maiden, who was depicted\r\nchained to the altar of some hideous, heathen deity, a monster who\r\ndevoured the flesh of virgins and demanded with pitiless lust the\r\nfairest of the race.\r\n\r\nOf her innocence he was at that moment profoundly convinced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nPUZZLED PHILOSOPHERS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile he still stood looking down upon her Viola began to moan and\r\ntoss her head from side to side.\r\n\r\n\"She is waking,\" cried Mrs. Lambert. \"Let me go to her.\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" commanded Weissmann, \"disturb nothing till we have examined all\r\nthings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Make your studies quickly,\" said Morton, his heart tender to the\r\ngirl's sufferings. \"We must release her as soon as possible.\"\r\n\r\nWeissmann was not to be hastened. \"If we do not now go slowly we lose\r\nmuch of what we are trying to attain. We must take her pulse and\r\ntemperature, and observe the position of every object.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite right,\" agreed Clarke, \"Do not be troubled--the psychic is\r\nbeing cared for.\"\r\n\r\nThus reassured the two investigators scrutinized, measured, made\r\nnotes, while Kate and Mrs. Lambert stood waiting, watching with\r\nanxious eyes the changes which came to Viola's face. Weissmann talked\r\non in a disjointed mutter. \"You see? She has no pulse. The threads are\r\nunbroken. The table is thirty inches from her finger-tips. Observe\r\nthis pad, forty-eight inches from her hand--and which contains a\r\nmessage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Read it!\" demanded Kate.\r\n\r\nHe complied. \"'_You ask for a particle of matter to be moved from A to\r\nB without the use of any force known to science. Here in this\r\nwineglass is the test. Oh, men of science, how long will you close\r\nyour eyes to the grander truths._'\"\r\n\r\n\"That is from father,\" remarked Mrs. Lambert.\r\n\r\n\"It is signed 'McLeod,' and under it are two words, 'Loggy' and\r\n'Mother,' each in different handwriting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give it to me!\" cried Kate, deeply moved.\r\n\r\n\"And here is the wineglass,\" replied Weissmann, extracting from among\r\nthe books a beautiful piece of antique crystal.\r\n\r\nKate took it reverentially, as if receiving it from the hand of her\r\ndead mother. \"How came that here?\"\r\n\r\n\"You recognize it? It was not left here by mistake?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no. There are only four of them left and I keep them locked away.\r\nI have not had them out in months.\"\r\n\r\nClarke smiled in benign triumph. \"That is why they brought it--to show\r\nyou that matter is an illusion and to prove that dematerialization and\r\ntransubstantiation are facts. That was the bell we heard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Morton, what do _you_ think? How could--\"\r\n\r\nBut Morton was bending above Viola and did not heed his sister. The\r\ngirl's eyes were opening as from natural slumber, and he said, gently:\r\n\"I hope you are not in pain? We will release you in a moment.\"\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: \"THE GIRL'S EYES WERE OPENING AS FROM NATURAL\r\n   SLUMBER\"]\r\n\r\nShe smiled faintly as she recognized him. \"My arms are numb, and my\r\nfeet feel as if strips of wood were nailed to my soles,\" she answered,\r\nwearily, \"and my head is aching dreadfully; but that will soon pass.\"\r\n\r\n\"She always complains of her feet,\" the mother explained. \"She can't\r\nwalk for quite a little while afterwards.\"\r\n\r\n\"You poor thing!\" exclaimed Kate. \"You are a martyr--that's what you\r\nare.\"\r\n\r\nViola looked up with sweet and anxious glance. \"Did anything happen?\r\nDid your friends come to you, Mrs. Rice?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but several voices spoke to Morton.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry no one came to you. I've been a long way off this time,\"\r\nshe continued, with dreamy, inward glance, \"into a beautiful country\r\nfrom which I hated to return. I wouldn't have come back to you at all\r\nonly a thread of light tied my soul to my body and drew me down to\r\nearth in spite of myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was it like--that far country?\" asked Morton.\r\n\r\nShe pondered sleepily. \"I can't tell you--only it was very beautiful\r\nand I was happy. Every one lived in the light with nothing to fear. I\r\nhad no memory of the earth--only of my body which I was sorry for.\r\nThere was no death, no cold, no darkness up there. I was very happy\r\nand free.\"\r\n\r\n\"You should be free and happy here,\" answered Morton, gravely. \"Come,\r\ndoctor, can't we free her now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you may do so,\" he replied, still busy with his note-book.\r\n\r\nThe young host, with a feeling of having been unnecessarily brutal,\r\nripped the tape loose from the floor, and Kate slipped the loops from\r\nViola's ankles. Then, leaning on her hostess's arm, she rose slowly,\r\nsmiling brightly, her weakness most appealing. \"I hope a great deal\r\nhappened--it means so much to me. I want to talk, but I can't now, my\r\nhead is too thick. You must tell me all about it pretty soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"A great deal happened--you are quite clear of any connection with\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nHer face lit with placid joy. \"Oh, I'm so glad! It must be very late,\"\r\nshe added, turning to her mother.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and we must be going,\" responded Mrs. Lambert, nervously. \"Mr.\r\nPratt will be impatient.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you'd stay with me to-night,\" pleaded Kate. \"It was all so\r\nwonderful. I can't let you go. Please stay! Both of you. You're too\r\ntired to go out into the raw air.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, we can't do that--not to-night,\" Viola answered, decisively.\r\n\r\nMorton threw back the doors. \"Kate, take Miss Lambert into the\r\ndining-room and give her something to drink. She is quite exhausted.\r\nLet me steady you,\" he said, tenderly, touching her arm. \"You fairly\r\nreel with weakness.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will be as well as ever as soon as my blood begins to circulate,\"\r\nshe bravely answered, and his touch quickened her pulse miraculously.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Weissmann had finished taking his notes and measurements,\r\nhe locked the door of the library and joined them all in the\r\ndining-room, where they were sipping coffee and nibbling cake. Morton\r\nwas sitting beside Viola (who had entirely regained her girlish\r\nlightness of mood), and was chafing her cold hand in the effort to\r\nrestore the circulation as well as to remove the deep mark the silken\r\nthread had made about her wrist.\r\n\r\n\"We shall be obliged to shut out all young men from our committee,\"\r\nthe old scientist jocularly remarked, as he stood looking down at\r\nthem. \"Lovely psychics like you would put the whole American Academy\r\nof Science in disorder.\"\r\n\r\nClarke, raging with jealous fire, turned to Weissmann in truculent\r\nmood. \"Well, Dr. Weissmann, how do you account for these phenomena? To\r\nwhose agency do you ascribe these marvels?\"\r\n\r\n\"Spooks!\" answered the old man, with cheerful promptness.\r\n\r\nClarke reeled before this laconic admission. \"What! You agree? You\r\nadmit the agency of spirits?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly--unless I say Miss Lambert wriggled herself out of her\r\nskin, which would not be nice of me, or that you are the greatest\r\nventriloquist in the world. No, I prefer to compliment the spirits.\"\r\n\r\nClarke's face darkened. The old man's face and voice were too jocose.\r\n\"I see you do not value our wonderful experiences to-night.\"\r\n\r\nViola, pinching her sleeve about her wrist, looked up roguishly. \"I\r\ncouldn't possibly wriggle out of my gown, could I, Dr. Weissmann? And\r\nif I did, how could I get the tacks back without a hammer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely. You would be more burglarious than the ghosts which walk\r\nthrough the key-holes,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"And the little girl who spoke German--who was she?\" asked Kate.\r\n\r\nThe hour that followed was a delicious one for the young people, for\r\nthey had come at last to some sweet and subtle understanding. As she\r\nrecovered the use of her limbs Viola glowed with joy of Morton's\r\nchange of attitude towards her. He, on his part, was puzzled by this\r\nmood. It was as if she had been vindicated to herself--liberated from\r\nsome dead body of doubt.\r\n\r\nClarke glowered in silence; disapproving, with manifest disdain, the\r\nlevity of the scientists, and resenting bitterly Viola's growing trust\r\nand confidence in Serviss. Each moment his anger took on heat, and he\r\nfound it hard to reply even to his hostess, who tried to interest him\r\nin a deeper discussion of the evening's marvels. He seemed to have but\r\none desire--to get away and to take Viola with him.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me,\" said Viola to Morton, \"did papa speak to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"A voice purporting to be your father spoke a few words.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is very nice. Didn't you think so?\"\r\n\r\n\"The voice was very gentle and refined, and expressed a very tender\r\nregard for you.\"\r\n\r\nShe sighed. \"I have never heard my father's voice, for he always comes\r\nwhen I am in my deepest trances. They say that I will be permitted\r\nsome day to hear all the voices through the cone--I only hear them now\r\nin an interior way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you really suffer as you seem to do?\" he asked, the echo of his\r\npity still in his tone.\r\n\r\n\"Not after I am really gone. Did I groan?\"\r\n\r\n\"Horribly! My heart was filled with remorse--\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry. It doesn't really hurt me--physically. You see I am\r\nperfectly well again. And yet I hate more and more to give myself up.\r\nI can't explain it, but I seem to be losing more and more of\r\n_myself_--that is the thought that scares me. I hate to think of being\r\nso helpless. It seems to me as if I were becoming like--like a hotel\r\npiano--for any one to strum on--I mean that any one in the other\r\nworld--It is so crowded over there, you know!\" Her brows drew together\r\nin momentary disgust.\r\n\r\n\"I _don't_ know, but it must be so if all the myriads of past humanity\r\nare living there. If I had my way you would never sit again,\" he\r\ndeclared, most fervently.\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't mind so much,\" she went on, \"if I were not marked out for\r\nsuspicion--if people would only talk to me of nice earthly things part\r\nof the time as they would to any other girl--but they never do.\r\nEverybody wants to talk to me about death and spirits--\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what gives edge to my remorse,\" he interrupted. \"Here am I\r\ndoing the very things you abhor. To think that we who have made such\r\na protest against your slavery could not allow you one free evening! I\r\nwill not say another word on these uncanny subjects.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I _want_ to talk of them to _you_! I wanted to tell you all about\r\nmyself that day we rode up to the mine--but I could not.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you had. It might have made a great deal of difference in your\r\nlife--and mine. I have been thinking of that ride to-night, as we sat\r\nin the darkness. If I could, I would keep you as girlish, as gay, as\r\nyou were that day. This business is all a desecration to me. I love to\r\nthink of you as you were then--when you laughed back at me in the\r\nrain. I wish we were both there this minute.\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled. \"You forget the time of night!\" Her face grew wistful.\r\n\"I've been getting homesick for the mountains lately--and yet I like\r\nit here. I love this beautiful room. I adore your sister. I know I\r\ncould have a delightful time if only my guides weren't so anxious to\r\nhave me convert the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"I grow more and more conscience-smitten!\" he exclaimed. \"To think we\r\nshould be the ones to tie and torture you, and at our first\r\ndinner-party!\"\r\n\r\n\"Please don't blame yourself. It was not your fault; grandfather\r\ninsisted on talking with you, and I--I wished it very much.\" Her face\r\ngrew radiant with pleasure. \"Oh, I'm so glad you made it a\r\ntest-sitting!--I want you to believe in me. I mean that I don't\r\ndeceive--\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure of that.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are so many things I want to talk with you about--but not\r\nnow--it is late.\"\r\n\r\nClarke, who had grown too restless to remain seated, interrupted a\r\nstory which Kate was relating, and rose, saying, harshly: \"It is time\r\nfor us to be going. Pratt will lock us out if we don't.\"\r\n\r\nThe cloud again fell on Viola's face--her little hour of freedom from\r\nher keeper was over. Morton felt the change in her, and so did Kate,\r\nwho fairly pleaded with the mother to remain. \"It is late and you are\r\ntired, and after this wonderful evening you ought not to go back to\r\nthat gloomy place.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lambert looked at Clarke, whose reply was stern. \"No, we must\r\nreturn.\"\r\n\r\nSomething very sweet and intimate was in Morton's voice as he found\r\nopportunity to say to Viola: \"I don't like to think of you returning\r\nto that gilded mausoleum. It is a most unwholesome place for you. You\r\nare too closely surrounded with morbid influences.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it. I dread to go back--I admit that. I suppose Mr. Pratt is a\r\ngood man, I know he does a great deal for the faith, and he is very\r\ngenerous to us, but oh, he is so vulgar, so impertinent! He bores me\r\nnearly frantic by being always at my elbow. I shudder when he touches\r\nme as if he were some sort of evil animal. Mother can't realize how he\r\nannoys and depresses me, and Anthony insists that we must endure it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you'd stay here!\" he exclaimed, impulsively. \"Accept my\r\nsister's invitation--it would give us such an opportunity to talk of\r\nthis sitting. Come, let me send for your trunks.\"\r\n\r\nShe shrank a little from his eager eyes, and Mrs. Lambert again\r\ninterposed. \"It is quite impossible, professor; perhaps some other\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nViola yielded to her mother and went away to get her cloak, and Morton\r\nturned to Clarke. \"One of the conditions of my promise to organize a\r\ncommittee is this: you and Pratt must be excluded from the circle.\"\r\n\r\nWeissmann echoed this. \"Quite right! That we demand.\"\r\n\r\nThe clergyman's face hardened. \"You ask the impossible. It is\r\nnecessary for me to be present at each sitting. I have the right to be\r\nthere as the historian of the case. Furthermore, I add to the strength\r\nof the manifestations--that I have fully demonstrated.\"\r\n\r\n\"I appreciate your position, but in order to avoid criticism, to make\r\nthe tests perfect, it will be necessary to hold the sittings either\r\nhere or at Weissmann's, and to exclude every one connected with Miss\r\nLambert. In no other way can we convince ourselves or the public.\"\r\n\r\nClarke's face was darkly stubborn. \"Then you will have no sittings. My\r\nchallenge will go forth next Sunday afternoon, and one of the\r\nunchangeable clauses of that challenge will be this: the sittings must\r\ntake place in Pratt's library and I must be present.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope you will not insist on that,\" Morton further urged; \"for Miss\r\nLambert's sake you must not. To incorporate such terms in your\r\nchallenge will brand her as an impostor and you and Pratt as her\r\nconfederates. In this statement I think you will find her 'controls'\r\nagreeing. They were undecided to-night, but when they consider\r\ncarefully they will see that my advice is sound.\"\r\n\r\nClarke's eyes were aflame. \"You have my terms. Accept them or refuse\r\nthem, as you please.\"\r\n\r\nViola, returning, extended her hand to Morton with a trustful smile.\r\n\"I've had a beautiful evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"To say that after we have tied you hand and foot till you were numb,\r\nand kept you in the dark all the evening, is very gracious of you. I\r\nfeel very much the brutal host. But you must come again. I swear Kate\r\nshall not pester you next time.\"\r\n\r\nKate was indignant. \"Well, I like that! when _you_ were the one crazy\r\nto experiment. Of course they're coming, coming to stay to-morrow\r\nnight, and any one who dares to talk ghosts to her will be sent to\r\nbed.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so in a hearty, cordial clangor of farewells they got out into the\r\nhall, and Morton, seeing Viola in her handsome cloak, her eyes\r\nshining, her face once more gay and smiling, was again filled with\r\nwonder at her astounding resiliency of mood. It was as if two sharply\r\ndifferentiated souls alternated in the possession of her body.\r\n\r\nClarke, wearing a cape overcoat and a soft hat, was far less admirable\r\nin appearance than when, with head uncovered, he sat within. He\r\nresembled a comic picture of an old-fashioned tragedian--a man glad\r\nto feel the finger of remark directed towards him, but his face was\r\nbitter, his eyes burning with anger, his lips white with pain.\r\n\r\nServiss relented as he studied him. \"You'd better take Britt's trail\r\nand return to the mountains,\" he said, kindly. \"This is a bad climate\r\nfor you.\"\r\n\r\n\"My work is here,\" he replied, curtly. \"I have no fear,\" and so they\r\nparted.\r\n\r\nWeissmann was sitting in silent meditation in one corner of the\r\ndining-room when Serviss returned. \"Well, master, what do you think of\r\nto-night's performance?\"\r\n\r\nWeissmann replied, in ironical phrase: \"Hearing in civilized man is\r\nvague and indefinite. Spooks do well to limit their manifestations to\r\na sense which most powerfully appeals to the imagination.\"\r\n\r\nMorton spoke with great earnestness. \"Weissmann, that girl could not\r\nmove a limb. She positively remained where we put her. So far as I am\r\nconcerned, to-night's test eliminated her from the slightest\r\ncomplicity, and I confess it rejoices me greatly; but who was\r\nresponsible for the prestidigitation?\"\r\n\r\nWeissmann replied, slowly: \"It is very puzzling,\" and fell into a muse\r\nwhich lasted for several minutes. At last he roused to say: \"Well, we\r\nwill see. Next time Clarke and the mother must be eliminated.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't think evil of her?\" exclaimed Morton.\r\n\r\n\"She is very anxious, you know--\"\r\n\r\nKate put in her word. \"It's all very simple,\" she said; \"the spirits\r\ndid it. You needn't tell me that Clarke or Mrs. Lambert got up and\r\nskittered around the room doing those things. I held their hands--and\r\nknow they didn't get away. Besides, how did that glass come there? and\r\nhow could they make those voices sound so natural? What is the use of\r\nbeing stupidly stubborn? If you treat Viola fairly she will confound\r\nyour science.\"\r\n\r\n\"You base all this on one imperfect test?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what you'd call a _perfect_ one. Anyhow, that child is\r\nabsolutely honest.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope you are right, Kate; but there are some serious\r\ndiscrepancies--even in to-night's performances. Nothing took place\r\nwhich I could not do sitting in her chair with my hands free.\"\r\n\r\n\"But her hands weren't free! If there is any virtue in cotton fibre or\r\nsteel she remained precisely where we set her at the beginning.\"\r\n\r\n\"But to admit that one book was moved from its place is to admit that\r\na force exists unknown to science.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what are you going to do? Did you do it? Or did I? Did Clarke\r\nreach from where he sat and manipulate the horn? Who brought the old\r\nwine-glass from the china-closet? No one entered from the\r\noutside--that is certain. And then the things 'Loggy' said?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you think, Dr. Weissmann?\"\r\n\r\nWeissmann looked up abstractedly. \"If Clarke performed these feats\r\nto-night he is wasting his time in any profession but jugglery. You\r\nsaid the cone touched you?\" he asked of Morton.\r\n\r\n\"Several times.\"\r\n\r\n\"To do that he must have left his seat.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am perfectly sure he did not,\" replied Kate, firmly.\r\n\r\nMorton insisted. \"He must have done so, Kate--there is no other\r\nexplanation of what took place. It was very dark and the rug soft.\r\nThere is another important point--all of the books came from within a\r\nradius of a few feet of the psychic, so that if she _were_ able to\r\nrise and free her hands--\"\r\n\r\n\"Which she did not do,\" answered Weissmann. \"She remained precisely\r\nwhere we put her; but we should have nailed Clarke to the floor also.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about the child who spoke German?\" asked Kate. \"Was she--\"\r\n\r\nWeissmann replied slowly, with a little effort, \"I had a little girl\r\nof the name Mina who died at eight years of age.\"\r\n\r\nKate's voice expressed sympathy. \"I didn't know that. She must have\r\nbeen a dear. The voice was very sweet. I could almost touch the little\r\nthing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not see how Clarke or any one here knew of my daughter or her\r\nname. Clarke may be a mind-reader. The voice did not prove itself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither was 'Loggy' quite convincing,\" said Morton. \"And yet I cannot\r\nunderstand how those voices were produced. Our imaginations must have\r\nbeen made enormously active by the dark. As scientists we cannot admit\r\nthe slightest of those movements without the fall of some of our most\r\ndeeply grounded dogmas. What becomes of Haeckel's dictum--that matter\r\nand spirit are inseparable?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is matter and matter,\" replied Weissmann. \"To say that spirit\r\nand flesh is inseparable is to claim too much. We can say that we have\r\nno proof of such separation, but Crookes and others claim the\r\ncontrary. It is curious to observe that we to-night have trenched on\r\nthe very ground Crookes trod. I am very eager now to sit with this\r\ngirl--the mother and Clarke being excluded.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of one thing I am more than half persuaded, and that is that Clarke\r\nis a mind-reader; for how else could he know the things which the\r\nsupposed ghost of my uncle recounted?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very puzzling,\" repeated Weissmann, deep-sunk in speculation;\r\nand in this abstraction he took himself silently away.\r\n\r\nKate, with an air of saying, \"Now that we are alone, let's know your\r\nreal mind,\" faced her brother with eyes of wonder. \"Morton, what do\r\nyou honestly think of it? Viola had nothing to do with it, did she?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; but are you absolutely sure Clarke did not get loose and do\r\nthings?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mort, I was never more alert in my life, and I _know_ he didn't move\r\nout of his chair.\"\r\n\r\n\"But think what it involves!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care what it involves. So far as the senses of touch and\r\nhearing go, Clarke remained seated every minute of the time, and I\r\ncertainly held both his and Mrs. Lambert's hands the whole time while\r\nthe books were being thrown.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there you are. Somebody did it.\" He shrugged his shoulders in\r\nan unwonted irritation.\r\n\r\n\"Why not say the spirits did it all?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because that is unthinkable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir William Crookes and Dr. Zöllner, you say, believed in these\r\ndisembodied intelligences--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but they belong to what Haeckel calls the imaginative\r\nscientists.\"\r\n\r\n\"You needn't quote Haeckel to me, Morton. If I believed what he\r\npreaches I would take myself and my children out of the world. I don't\r\nsee how a man can look a child in the face and say such things. I\r\ncan't read any of your scientific friends straight along. Their jargon\r\nis worse than anything, but I pick out enough to know that they don't\r\nbelieve in anything they can't see, and they won't go out of their way\r\nto see things. Do you suppose I'm going to believe that Robbie is\r\nnothing but a little animal, and that if he should die his soul would\r\ndisappear like a vapor?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can only repeat that the converse is unthinkable. There is no room\r\nin my philosophy for the re-entrance of the dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not? It's all very simple. We're creatures of our surroundings,\r\naren't we? Now, sitting there in the dark to-night, it seemed to me\r\nthat the people we think of as dead were all about me. It scared me at\r\nfirst; but, really, isn't it the most comforting faith in the world?\r\nI've always liked the idea of the Indian's happy 'hunting-grounds'--and\r\nthis is something like it.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled shrewdly. \"That performance to-night and this conversation\r\nwould make a pretty story to lay before the president of Corlear--now\r\nwouldn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you suppose he will take your going into this investigation?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, but I think he'll 'fire' me instanter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, let him try it! He wouldn't _dare_--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, he would, if he thought I was hurting the institution. See\r\nwhat they did to poor little Combes, who mildly claimed to be able to\r\nhypnotize people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but he made himself ridiculous in the papers.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean the papers made him ridiculous. Couldn't they do the same\r\nwith Weissmann and me? Think of a big, sprawling, sketchy drawing in\r\nthe _Blast_, with Weissmann glaring at a strangely beautiful young\r\nlady in scanty gown--his hands spread like claws upon the table, while\r\nanother younger man (myself) catches at a horn floating overhead. Oh\r\nyes, there are great possibilities in to-night's entertainment. May I\r\nask you, Mrs. Rice, to be more than usually circumspect?\"\r\n\r\n\"You may, Dr. Serviss.\"\r\n\r\nHe rose gravely. \"Very good. Now I think you would better go to bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish your Mr. Lambert would come.\"\r\n\r\n\"So do I. I'm afraid he is going to ignore my summons. Unless I hear\r\nfrom him to-morrow I shall consider him craven or indifferent.\"\r\n\r\n\"What will you do then?\"\r\n\r\nHis brows contracted into a frown. \"I don't know. She should be freed\r\nfrom Clarke's immediate influence, but I don't see how I can\r\ninterfere.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't believe that she really cares for him; in fact, from things\r\nshe said to-night, I think she fears him. He was furiously jealous of\r\nyou, I could see that. And I must say you gave him cause.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned and looked at her in affected amazement. \"Where are you\r\nheading now?\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed. \"Where are you drifting, my boy? I never saw any one more\r\nabsorbed, and I can't say I blame you; she was lovely. Good-night.\"\r\nAnd so she left him.\r\n\r\nSitting thus alone in the deep of the night, the flush of his joy at\r\nthe proof of Viola's innocence grew gray and cold in a profound\r\ndisbelief in the reality of his experiences. \"_Did_ anything really\r\nhappen?\" he asked himself. Returning to the library with intent to\r\nstudy the situation he mused long upon the tumbled books, the horn,\r\nthe tables, and the chairs. He put himself in Viola's seat in the\r\nattempt to conceive of some method whereby even the most skilful\r\nmagician would be able to pull out tacks, rip stitches, and break\r\ntape--and then--more difficult than all, after manipulating the horn,\r\nreseat himself and restore his bonds, every tack, to its precise\r\nplace. And his conversation with \"Loggy,\" most amazing of all, came\r\nback to plague him. What could explain that marvellous simulation of\r\nhis uncle's chuckling laugh?\r\n\r\nYes, Viola was clearly innocent. It was impossible for her to have\r\nlifted a hand; that he decided upon finally--and yet it was almost as\r\ndifficult for Clarke or Mrs. Lambert to have performed all the tricks,\r\n\"Unless Kate\"--he brought himself up short--\"in the end, my own\r\nsister, is involved in the imposture,\" he exclaimed, with a sense of\r\nbewilderment.\r\n\r\nWhen he dwelt on Viola's delight in her own vindication, and\r\nremembered her serene, sweet, trustful glance, a shiver of awe went\r\nover him, and the work of saving her, of healing her, seemed greater\r\nthan the discovery of any new principle; but whenever his keen,\r\ndefinite, analytic mind took up the hit-or-miss absurd caperings of\r\n\"the spirits\" he paced the floor in revolt of their childish\r\nchicanery. That the soul survived death he could not for an instant\r\nentertain. Every principle of biology, every fibre woven into his\r\nsystem of philosophy repelled the thought. To grant one single claim\r\nof the spiritists was disaster. \"No, the mother and Clarke are in\r\nleague, and when the bonds are on one the other acts. I see no other\r\nexplanation. I distrust Clarke utterly--but the mother is apparently\r\nvery gentle and candid, and yet--Weissmann may be right. Maternal love\r\nis a very powerful emotion. That second voice was like hers. And yet,\r\nand yet, to suspect that gentle soul of deliberate deception is a\r\nterrible thing. What a world of vulgarity and disease and suspicion it\r\nall is! An accursed world, and the history of every medium is filled\r\nwith these same insane, foolish, absurd doings.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so he trod in weary circles, returning always to the same point,\r\nwith an almost audible groan. \"Why, _why_ was that charming girl\r\ninvolved in all this uncanny, hellish, destructive business? Clarke\r\nclaims her. On him her fate depends. Perhaps at this moment her name\r\nand hideous reproductions of her face are being printed in all the\r\nsensational papers of the city. Oh, that crazy preacher! It may be\r\nthat he has already made her rescue impossible.\" And always the dark,\r\ndisturbing thought came at the end to trouble him. \"Can she ever\r\nregain a normal relation with the world--even if I should interfere?\r\nShe should have been freed from this traffic long ago. Can the science\r\nof suggestion reach her? Am I already too late?\"\r\n\r\nThe conception that sank deepest and remained most abhorrent in his\r\nmusings was that conveyed in her own tragic words: \"_It seems to me I\r\nam becoming more and more like a public piano, an instrument on which\r\nany one can strum--and the other world is so crowded, you know!_\"\r\n\r\n\"If there is any manhood left in Lambert he must assert it or I will\r\nthrottle Clarke myself,\" he muttered through clinched teeth. \"I ran\r\naway two years ago--I evaded my duty yesterday, but I do not intend to\r\ndo so now. I will not sit by and see that sweet girl's will, her very\r\nreason, overthrown by a fanatic preacher eager for notoriety. I will\r\nsee her again and demand to know from her own lips whether she is in\r\nconsent to be his wife. I cannot believe it till she tells me so, and\r\nthen I can decide as to future action.\"\r\n\r\nAnd at the moment he was comforted by the recollection of something\r\ntimidly confiding in her parting smile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nVIOLA REVOLTS FROM CLARKE\r\n\r\n\r\nNo sooner were they seated in their carriage than Clarke broke forth\r\nin harsh protest. \"You must not think of leaving Pratt's house at this\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" asked Viola, roused by the tone of his voice, which was\r\neven less considerate than his words.\r\n\r\n\"Because it will displease him--may possibly alienate him just at a\r\nmoment when we need him most. He will not consent to be shut out from\r\nthese test-sittings; on the contrary, he is likely to insist on their\r\ntaking place in his own library. Furthermore, I don't see why you are\r\nin haste to leave so sumptuous an abode.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I hate him, and all connected with him.\" Her voice was\r\ncolored with a fierce disgust. \"That is the reason, and reason\r\nenough.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must not let him know that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care if he knows it or not. We are not dependent on him or\r\nhis house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we are! He is most important to all of us until our tests are\r\nover and my book in type. I need his indorsement besides. He is very\r\nbitter and vindictive with those whom he thinks should be very\r\ngrateful, and we must not anger him; we can't afford it.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lambert mildly protested. \"I'm sure Mr. Pratt will not think of\r\ndetaining us if father thinks it best for us to go, and I confess I am\r\nanxious to get away myself, Tony. He has been very disagreeable\r\nlately.\"\r\n\r\nClarke went on: \"We must continue to let him think his advice and aid\r\ninvaluable till our book is out, then we can cut loose from him. Our\r\npolicy--\"\r\n\r\nRebellion was in Viola's heart as she cuttingly interrupted: \"You\r\nspeak as if we were in league to cheat him of something. You have\r\nalways told me that my powers were 'dedicated to the good of the\r\nworld,' but lately you talk as if they were dedicated to your personal\r\nadvancement in some way. Now which do you really mean?\"\r\n\r\nHe saw his mistake. Once or twice before he had met her complete\r\nopposition, and he feared it. His voice suppled, became persuasive. \"I\r\nmean, Viola, that in entering upon a great contest--one whose issue is\r\nto electrify the civilized world--\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe it. What does the world care about a little speck of\r\nhumanity like me? Professor Serviss is nearer right when he says that\r\nconverting people to any creed is a thankless task. Ask grandfather to\r\nlet me live my own life. He listens to you. Tell him I'm tired and--\"\r\n\r\n\"He has promised to be easier on you after we have won our battle.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I dread the battle--oh, how I dread it! Professor Serviss says we\r\nwill lose.\"\r\n\r\nClarke broke in, sharply: \"Please don't quote what Serviss says. His\r\nview is that of the worldly wise materialist. You should listen to my\r\nadvice--not his.\"\r\n\r\n\"You said you were anxious to have him on the committee.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, because I thought his name would count, and that he could bring\r\nWeissmann--but now I distrust him. He is too bigoted.\"\r\n\r\nAs he continued in this strain he stood in dark contrast to Morton,\r\nand the girl could not but wince under the revelation he was\r\nunconsciously making. \"Anthony, you have talked in that strain ever\r\nsince we came East. Nothing but using people, using people, all the\r\ntime. You've been constantly running after those who could 'be of use\r\nto us!' and I don't like it. Every word you're saying now makes me\r\ndoubt your sincerity. I was ashamed of you to-night--I am ashamed of\r\nyou now. How can I respect you when you say things like that?\"\r\n\r\nHe again tacked. \"I do it all for the furtherance of our faith. To do\r\nour work we _must_ have authority. It is always necessary to make a\r\nbig stir in the world in order to do good--think of Christ defying the\r\nmoney-changers and making a scene in the temple!\"\r\n\r\nShe pursued her way. \"It's the tone of your voice that scares me.\r\nYou're a different person since we came here--you've been harsh and\r\ncruel to me.\" Her voice choked, and yielding to a flood of doubt she\r\ncried out: \"I've lost faith in you. This ends it all, I will never\r\nmarry you! I don't care what my 'guides' say. I daren't trust myself\r\nto you--now that's the truth.\"\r\n\r\nThe mother was aghast. \"Why, Viola Lambert! What a terrible thing to\r\nsay!\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't help it, mother--that is my decision.\"\r\n\r\nClarke blundered a third time. \"I won't release you! This mood is all\r\nthe influence of those accursed pagans we have just left. That man\r\nServiss has been an evil influence upon you from the very first. He\r\nhas no God in his heart. You must keep away from that home--it is\r\ndestructive.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not!\" she retorted, fiercely. \"It is beautiful and honest\r\nand--sane, and I'm going there as often as they will let me--and I'm\r\ngoing to leave the Pratt house to-morrow! I will not stay there\r\nanother day.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are others to be consulted about this,\" he grimly answered.\r\n\"You have tried playing truant before.\"\r\n\r\nShe was now in full tide of revolt. \"I am going to leave that house if\r\nI fall dead in the streets. I am going if 'they' choke me black in the\r\nface.\"\r\n\r\nHe sneered. \"I know where you are going!\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment she hated him and everything he stood for, and her\r\nvoice was hoarse with her passion. \"I don't care what you say or what\r\nyou do, I will not be hounded and driven around like a slave by you or\r\nSimeon Pratt any longer. I'm going to have a little life of my own if\r\n'they' tear me in pieces for it.\"\r\n\r\nThis outburst, so much more intense than any which had preceded it,\r\nalarmed Clarke and appalled Mrs. Lambert, who took her daughter in\r\nher arm with soothing words and caresses. \"There, there, dearie! Don't\r\nworry--don't excite yourself. Father will not insist on your doing\r\nanything that will be harmful. He will protect you.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl, sobbing in reaction, bowed to the maternal bosom, feeling\r\nonce more her own helplessness, receiving no help from her mother's\r\nsympathy, which was merely superficial. Her only hope of release lay\r\nin the strong, bright, self-reliant, humorous people she had just\r\nleft, those to whom her grandfather and his \"band\" were less than\r\nshadows. They alone could save her from the despairing madness which\r\nshe felt creeping upon her like a beast in the night. Her nerves,\r\nstrung to dangerous tension, gave away utterly, and Clarke, realizing\r\nthis, ceased to chide, and the ride ended without another word.\r\n\r\nPratt, who had been waiting for hours with the angry impatience of\r\nsenility, met them at the door, truculent as a terrier. \"What time o'\r\nnight do you call this?\" he asked, with insulting inflection.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lambert answered: \"I'm very sorry, but we had a sitting, and it\r\ntook longer--\"\r\n\r\n\"A sitting!\" He faced Viola. \"What did you do that for? I told you I\r\ndidn't want any sittings given unless I was present, and you promised\r\nnot to give any.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not!\" she replied, lifting a tear-stained but imperious face to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Clarke did.\"\r\n\r\nClarke hastily interposed: \"The 'chief control' asked for it--said he\r\nwanted to talk to some of those present.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care what the 'chief control' said--\"\r\n\r\nViola, thoroughly roused, now faced him, pale and scornful. \"What\r\nright have you to ask where I've been or what I've done? I am not your\r\nservant--nor one of your poor relatives. You seem to forget that. I\r\nwill not be your guest another day! I'd leave this house this instant\r\nif I could. I came here against my wish, and I will not be insulted by\r\nyou any longer. I wish I had never seen you.\" And with haughty step\r\nshe started to pass him.\r\n\r\nHe put out a hand to stay her. \"Hold on, now!\"\r\n\r\nWith flashing eyes and a voice that smote him like a whip, she cried\r\nout, \"Leave me alone, please!\" He fell back against the wall, and she\r\npassed on and up the stairway, leaving him leaning there in dismay,\r\nhis jaw lax.\r\n\r\nThe mother hastily followed, and as the door closed behind them Viola\r\nturned with blazing eyes. \"This is horrible--disgraceful! I hope you\r\nenjoy being treated like that! How can you endure it? How can you ask\r\nme to endure it? If Anthony Clarke possessed one shred of real\r\nmanhood--But he hasn't. He's so selfishly bent on his own plans he's\r\nwilling to let me suffer anything. I'm done with him, mother. You\r\nneedn't try to find excuse for him. I don't see how I endured him so\r\nlong. He must never touch me again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't do anything rash, child.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you submit to more insult? You can stay on till you are ordered\r\nout of the house if you like, but I will not!\"\r\n\r\n\"But you know they advise it.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl turned, a new tone in her voice. \"There, now, mother, we come\r\nback to that again! I'm tired of hearing that. If they insist on our\r\nstaying here I will be sure they are the voices of devils and not\r\nthose they claim to be. I don't believe my father would ask me to stay\r\nin a house where the very servants sniff at us. I don't believe he\r\nwould let Anthony make use of me in this way. Professor Serviss calls\r\nour faith a delusion, and to-night I almost hope he's right. I have\r\nlost the spirit of the martyr, and everything seems foolish to me.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lambert regarded her daughter with horror. \"Child, some\r\nearth-bound spirit has surely taken possession of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope it will stay till to-morrow--till I get out of this house,\"\r\nshe replied, and went to her own room without a good-night kiss,\r\nleaving her mother hurt and dismayed.\r\n\r\nA few moments later Clarke knocked at the sitting-room door. \"Julia,\r\nhere is a message I want you to give to Viola.\"\r\n\r\nAs she opened to him he faced her, pale and tremulous, all his anger,\r\nall his resolution gone. \"She was unjust to me,\" he said, humbly;\r\n\"take her this.\" He extended a folded leaf of paper in a hand that\r\npartook of the pallor of his face.\r\n\r\n\"You poor boy,\" she exclaimed, her heart wrung by his suffering, \"you\r\nmustn't mind what she said--it was only a girlish pet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mother,\" he cried, passionately, \"to lose her now would kill me. She\r\nis my hope, my stay, my God! She has stabbed me to the heart to-night.\r\nDid she mean it? She can't mean it!\"\r\n\r\nShe patted him on the shoulder. \"Go to bed, laddie, it's only a mood.\r\nShe will be all sunshine to-morrow. It's only a reaction from a\r\nwearisome day--be patient and don't worry.\"\r\n\r\n\"She tortured me deliberately,\" he went on, wildly. \"She let that man\r\ntake her hand. She smiled at him in a way that set my brain on fire. I\r\ntried to be calm. I didn't intend to speak harshly, but I wanted to\r\nkill him when he said good-night to her. May God eternally damn his\r\nsoul if he tries to steal her from me!\"\r\n\r\nShe recoiled from his fury. \"Tony! What are you saying?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean it! Do you think I will submit to his treachery? I told him\r\nshe was mine, and yet he took her hand--he leaned to her--he looked\r\ninto her face.\" His eyes blazed with such wild light that the gentle\r\nwoman shrank and shivered.\r\n\r\n\"Tony, you are letting your imagination run away with you. Go to bed\r\nthis instant,\" she commanded, in a voice that trembled.\r\n\r\nHe went away at last, weeping, miserably maudlin, almost incoherent,\r\nand when she closed and locked the door upon him she dropped into a\r\nchair, and for the first time since her husband's death gave way to\r\ntears of bewilderment and despair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE OF DISCORD\r\n\r\n\r\nSurely Simeon's house that night was a place of tormenting and\r\ntumult--the meeting-place of spirits whose dispositions were to evil\r\nfully inclined, and of mortals whose natures were upon the edge of\r\ncombat. Viola, in full revolt, would not even permit her mother to\r\ncome to her. Clarke, in an agony of love and hate, paced his room or\r\nsat in dejected heap before his grate. Mrs. Lambert, realizing that\r\nsomething sorrowful was advancing upon her, lay awake a long time\r\nhoping her daughter would relent and steal in to kiss her good-night,\r\nbut she did not, and at last the waters of sleep rolled in to submerge\r\nand carry away her cares.\r\n\r\nViola, made restless by her disgust of Pratt as well as by her loss of\r\nrespect and confidence in Clarke, did not lose herself till nearly\r\ndawn. Her mind was at first busy with the past, filled with a\r\nprocession of the many things he had done to enrich her life. She was\r\ntroubled by the remembrance of the grave, sad courtesy of his\r\nintercourse in the days just following his wife's death. At that time\r\nhis kindly supervision of her music and his suggestions for her reading\r\nhad given him dignity and romantic charm. \"He was nice then,\" she said\r\nto herself. \"If only he had stopped there.\" When he fell at her feet in\r\nthe attempt to rouse her pity he had been degraded in her eyes. His\r\nwhole manner towards her became that of suppliant--beseeching the\r\n\"guides\" to sanction their ultimate union. She burned with shame as she\r\nthought of her tacit acquiescence in this arrangement. \"You have no\r\nright to interfere with my--with such things,\" she now said to the\r\ninvisible ones. \"I do not love Anthony Clarke. I don't even respect him\r\nany longer.\"\r\n\r\nHe had, indeed, become almost as offensive to her as Pratt, and the\r\npicturesque, soulful presence which he affected was at the moment\r\nrepugnant. In contrast to the young scientist he was mentally and\r\nmorally sick, and the world which he inhabited (and which she shared\r\nwith him) hopelessly askew. Of this she had a clear perception as her\r\nmind recalled and dwelt upon the taste, the comfort, the orderly cheer\r\nof the Serviss home.\r\n\r\n\"We never made the spirit-world so awful. Mamma did not take such an\r\nexcited view of it all. What has produced this change in us? Tony has.\r\nHe has carried us out into a nasty world and he has set us among\r\nfrauds and fanatics, and I will not suffer it any longer.\"\r\n\r\nShe did him an injustice, but she was at the same time right. Mrs.\r\nLambert, left to herself, would have kept a serene mind no matter what\r\nthe manifestations might be. With her the world of spirit\r\ninterpenetrated the world of every-day life, and the one was quite as\r\nnatural as the other and of helpful, cheering effect. She had remained\r\nquite as normal in her ways of thought as when in Colorow, and aside\r\nfrom her dependence upon the spirit-world for guidance would not have\r\nseemed at any point to be akin to either fraud or fanatic.\r\n\r\nAt last the girl's restless mind, cleared of its anger, its doubts and\r\nits doles, came back to rest upon the handsome, humorous, refined face\r\nof young Dr. Serviss. She felt again the touch of his deft, strong\r\nhands, and heard again the tender cadence of his voice as he said: \"I\r\nhope you are not in pain? We will release you very soon.\" She dwelt\r\nlong upon the final scene at the table, when, with a jesting word on\r\nhis lips, but with love in his eyes, he took her hand to remove the\r\nmarks of her bonds; and the flush that came to her was not one of\r\nanger--it rose from the return of her joy of those few moments of\r\nsweet companionship.\r\n\r\nHow sane and strong and safe he was. \"He does not believe in our\r\nfaith, but he does not hate me. How Dr. Weissmann loves him! They are\r\nlike father and son.\"\r\n\r\nThinking upon these people and their home, with their griefs, their\r\neasy, off-hand, penetrating comments, their laughter filling her ears,\r\nthe girl grew drowsy with some foreknowledge of happier days to come,\r\nand fell asleep with a faint smile upon her lips.\r\n\r\nShe woke late to find her mother bending over her, and lifting her\r\narms she drew the gray head down to her soft, young bosom and\r\npenitently said: \"Mamma, forgive me. I am sorry I spoke as I did. I am\r\nnot angry this morning, but I am determined. We must go away from here\r\nthis very day.\"\r\n\r\nThe mother did not at once reply, but when she spoke her voice\r\ntrembled a little. \"I guess you're right, dearie. This house seems\r\nlike a prison to me this morning. But what troubles me most is this:\r\nWhy do Maynard and father permit us to stay here? I am afraid of Mr.\r\nPratt--everybody says he will make us trouble, and yet our dear ones\r\nurge us to remain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mamma,\" gravely replied Viola, \"I want to tell you something that\r\ncame to me this morning. I wonder if _what grandfather says is not\r\nmade up of what Pratt and Anthony want_?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, child?\" asked the mother, sitting back into a chair\r\nand staring at her daughter with vague alarm.\r\n\r\n\"I mean that--that--grandfather, strong as he seems to be, is\r\ninfluenced in some way by Tony. He goes against my wishes and against\r\nyour wishes, but _he never goes against Tony's_.\"\r\n\r\nThe mother pondered. \"But that is because Tony is content to follow\r\n_his_ will.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl lost her firm tone. \"I know that interpretation can be given\r\nto it, but to-day I _feel_ that it is the other way, and, besides, it\r\nmay be that grandfather doesn't realize all our troubles.\"\r\n\r\nThe mother rose. \"It's all very worrisome, and I wish some change\r\nwould come. I dread to meet Mr. Pratt, but I suppose I must.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't go down. I don't intend to see him again if I can avoid it.\r\nRing for your coffee and take your breakfast here with me this\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. That would only make him angry. I'll go down.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care what he says, mamma, I shall do as I like hereafter.\"\r\n\r\nWith this defiant reply ringing in her ears, Mrs. Lambert went slowly\r\ndown the stairs to find the master of the house, sullen, sour, and\r\nvindictive, breakfasting alone in his great dining-room. As she\r\ntimidly entered he looked up from his toast with a grunt of greeting,\r\nand Mrs. Lambert, seeing that his resentment still smouldered, stopped\r\non the threshold pale with premonition of assault. She would have fled\r\nhad she dared to do so, but the maid drew a chair for her, and so she\r\nseated herself opposite him in silence.\r\n\r\n\"Where's that girl?\" he asked, harshly.\r\n\r\n\"She's not feeling very well this morning, so I told her she needn't\r\ncome down to breakfast.\"\r\n\r\nHe grunted in scorn. \"What happened over there last night? Everybody\r\nseems upset by it. I want to know all about it. You had a sitting, did\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whose idea was that--Clarke's?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, father wanted to speak with Dr. Serviss and Dr. Weissmann.\"\r\n\r\n\"Weissmann was there, was he? What did _he_ say?\"\r\n\r\n\"He seemed impressed.\"\r\n\r\n\"What happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"Father came, as usual--\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean what happened outside the séance? Something set that girl\r\nagainst me and upset Clarke. I want to know what it was.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think anything was said of you at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, there was. You can't fool me. Somebody warned that girl against\r\nme. The whole thing seems funny to me.\" (By funny he meant strange.)\r\n\"You go away from my house for a dinner against my will--leave me in\r\nthe lurch--and come home at one o'clock in the morning with faces that\r\nwould sour milk, and now here you are all avoiding me this morning. It\r\njust convinces me that if we're going to carry on this work together\r\nwe've got to have a definite understanding. You've got to stop going\r\nto such houses and giving séances without my permission. I won't have\r\nthat under any conditions.\"\r\n\r\nClarke, who had appeared at the doorway, a worn, and troubled spectre\r\nof dismay, now put in a confirmatory word. \"You are quite right,\r\nSimeon. That house reeks with the talk of wine-bibbers and those who\r\nmake life a witticism. Such an atmosphere profoundly affects Viola.\"\r\n\r\nPratt glowered at him with keen, contemptuous glance. \"You look as if\r\nyou'd been drawn through a knot-hole. What happened to _you_?\" As\r\nClarke did not reply to this he took another line of inquiry. \"About\r\nthis sitting, what was the upshot?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a very remarkable test-sitting, and seemed to make a profound\r\nimpression. The conditions were severe--\"\r\n\r\n\"Why was I left out? That's what I want to know.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what puzzles me. McLeod, who promised us never to have a\r\ncircle without you, insisted on the sitting there--\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know he did? Did he write or speak to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--he _impressed_ the psychic.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't trust that girl in such a house. Did you talk with Weissmann\r\nabout heading the committee?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but\"--he hesitated--\"they both insisted that if they took the\r\nmatter up both of us must be excluded.\"\r\n\r\nPratt bristled. \"And you consented to that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not. I insisted that the sittings take place here and that we\r\nbe present. They would not listen to that, so I think I'll go ahead on\r\nmy programme and decide upon the personnel of the committee\r\nafterwards.\"\r\n\r\nPratt regarded him fixedly. \"I'm not sure I like your programme, my\r\nfriend. I've been thinking it over lately, and I've just about come to\r\nthe conclusion that you'd better not issue that challenge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\nPratt snapped like a peevish bull-dog. \"Because I don't want it\r\ndone--that's all the reason you need. I've never made any concessions\r\nto reach these damn scientists, and I don't intend to begin now. You\r\nare planning to involve us in a whole lot of noise and sensation, and\r\nI don't like it. Furthermore, I don't intend to submit to it.\"\r\n\r\nClarke was too irritable to take this quietly, and his eyes blazed.\r\n\"You're very sensitive all at once. When did you reach this new point\r\nof view?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never you mind about that; I've reached it, and I intend to maintain\r\nit. Why, you simple-minded jackass, these scientists will eat you up.\r\nThey'll make a monkey of me and disgrace the girl. They'll pretend to\r\nexpose her--the press will be on their side--and I will be made the\r\nbutt of all their slurring gibes. I won't have it!\"\r\n\r\n\"You're too nervous about the press,\" replied Clarke, loftily. \"You're\r\nall wrong about the papers. They'll take a malicious joy in girding at\r\nthe scientists as 'the men who know it all.' They'll have their fling\r\nat us, of course, but it won't hurt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it won't! Well, it may not hurt you--it's a fine stroke of\r\nadvertising for you--but I don't need that kind of publicity. That's\r\nsettled! Now, about this man Serviss\"--he turned to Mrs. Lambert--\"is\r\nhe married?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought not. How long has he known Viola?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's nearly two years since he came to Colorow; but he has only seen\r\nher a few times--\"\r\n\r\nPratt cut her short. \"I begin to understand. You'd better not let him\r\nmix in here--he's too young and too good-looking to conduct\r\nexperiments of this kind with your girl. If you had any sense,\r\nClarke, you'd see that for yourself.\"\r\n\r\nClarke's expression changed. His cheeks grew livid with his passion,\r\nand his eyes burned with the same wild light that had filled them as\r\nhe looked across the room at Morton bending over Viola's hand. Pratt's\r\nbrutal frankness had cleared his own thought and re-aroused his sense\r\nof proprietorship in the girl. Until that dinner came with its\r\nrevelation, he had thought of Serviss merely as the scientist to be\r\nused to further his own plans. Now he knew him for what he was--a\r\nyoung and dangerous rival. With a sinking of the heart he suspected\r\nhim to be a successful rival.\r\n\r\nHe rose from the table and left the room, and Mrs. Lambert followed\r\nhim fearful of what he might do in his rage.\r\n\r\n\"Tony, Tony!\" she called.\r\n\r\nHe turned and faced her, his face set in horrible lines, his fists\r\nclinched. \"I've been a fool, a fool!\" he declared, through set teeth.\r\n\"Why didn't you warn me? I should have made her safely my own before I\r\ncame East. She loves him, but he shall not have her--by God he shall\r\nnot! Where is she? Tell her I must see her!\"\r\n\r\nShe pleaded for delay, and at last calmed him so that he left her and\r\nwent to his room. She then hastened to Viola and locked the door\r\nbehind her.\r\n\r\n\"Viola, dear, get ready! We must leave this house at once,\" she said,\r\nbreathlessly.\r\n\r\n\"What has happened?\" asked Viola.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lambert took time to think. \"It was very disagreeable. They are\r\nwrangling again about that challenge and about you.\"\r\n\r\n\"About me! Yes, that's what wears on me--they wrangle about me as if I\r\nhad no right to say what part I am to take. But it's all over, mother;\r\nunless grandfather holds me by the throat every mortal minute to-day\r\nI'm going into the street--\"\r\n\r\nA knock at the door startled them both, but it proved to be the maid,\r\nwho said, \"Here is a note from Mr. Clarke, miss; he said, 'be sure and\r\nbring an answer,' miss.\"\r\n\r\nThe note was a passionate appeal for a meeting, but Viola wrote across\r\nit in firm letters, \"No. It is useless,\" and returned it to the girl.\r\n\"Take that to him,\" she said, careless of the fact that her refusal\r\nwas open to the eyes of the messenger.\r\n\r\nWhen they were again in private she said: \"We'll go if we have to\r\ntelephone the police to help us. And I'm going to wire Papa-Joe to\r\ncome and take us home.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are cruel to Tony, child.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I'm not! He must understand, once for all, that I belong to\r\nmyself. I never really cared for him. Deep in my heart I was afraid of\r\nhim, and now he has grown so egotistical that he is willing to\r\nsacrifice me to his own aims, and I hate him. I will not see him again\r\nif I can avoid it.\"\r\n\r\nThe mother protested less and less strongly, for she was forced to\r\nadmit that something fine and true had gone out of her idol, and that\r\nhe now stood in a new and harsh light. All the hard lines of his face\r\nappeared to her, and his pallor, his deep-set eyes were those of a\r\nsick and restless soul. She no longer rejoiced at the thought of\r\ngiving her daughter into his hands.\r\n\r\nClarke was truly in a pitiable state of incertitude and despair. His\r\noration, his interdicted challenge, his book, his religion were all\r\nswallowed in by the one great passion which now flooded and filled his\r\nbrain--his love for Viola. \"She belongs to me,\" he repeated, as he\r\nwalked his room with shaking limbs, a dry, hard knot in his throat,\r\nhis eyes hot with tears that would not fall. \"She must surrender\r\nherself to me--finally and now--to-day, I will wait no longer. She\r\nmust leave this house at once--but she must go as my wife! She is\r\nright. Pratt is a beast--a savage. He will rage--he will vilify us\r\nboth, but we will defy him. Our 'guides' will confound him. We are,\r\nafter all, not dependent upon him. We can go on--\" The maid,\r\nreturning, handed him Viola's answer and went hastily out. He read it\r\nand reread it till its finality burned into his brain, then dropped\r\ninto a deep chair and there lay for a long time in despairing stupor.\r\n\r\nWas it all over, then? Was her final decision in that curt scrawl? She\r\nhad returned his own note as if with intent to emphasize her refusal\r\nto see him, and yet only a few days ago she had assented to all his\r\nplans, leaning upon his advice. What had produced this antagonism?\r\nWhat evil influence was at work?\r\n\r\nHe rose on a sudden, fierce return of self-mastery, and went to Mrs.\r\nLambert's door and knocked, and when she opened to him demanded of her\r\na full explanation. \"What is the matter? Is she sick or is she\r\nhatefully avoiding me?\"\r\n\r\n\"She's all upset, Anthony. Don't worry, she will see you by-and-by.\"\r\n\r\n\"She _must_ see me! After what she said last night I can't think--I am\r\nin agony. What is the matter with us all? Yesterday we were\r\ntriumphant; to-day I feel as if everything were sinking under my feet.\r\nShe shall not leave me! I will not have it so! Tell her I insist on\r\nseeing her! I beg her to speak to me if only for a moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will tell her you are here.\" She left him at the threshold, a\r\nhaggard and humble suitor, while she knocked at her daughter's door.\r\n\"Viola, child, Anthony is here. Let me in just a moment.\"\r\n\r\nAs he waited the half-frenzied man noted the absence of certain family\r\nportraits and cried aloud, poignantly: \"She is packing! She is going\r\naway!\" And when Mrs. Lambert returned he seized her by the arm, his\r\neyes wild and menacing. \"Tell me the truth! She is preparing to\r\nleave.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lambert looked away. \"I tried to reason with her, Anthony. I\r\nwanted her to 'sit for council,' but she's so crazy to get away she\r\nwill not do it. She will hardly speak to _me_.\"\r\n\r\n\"She must not go--she shall not leave me! I will not permit her to go\r\nto him!\" His voice rose and his lifted hand shook.\r\n\r\n\"Hush, Tony! She will hear you. Please go away and let me deal with\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\nHe lifted his face and spoke with closed eyes. \"Donald McLeod, if you\r\nare present, intercede for me. Bring her to me. Command her to remain.\r\nYou gave her to me. You led us here. Will you permit her to ruin all\r\nour plans? Stretch out your hand in power. Do you hear me?\" There was\r\nno answer to his appeal, neither tap nor rustle of reply. In the\r\nsilence his heart contracted with fear. \"Have you deserted me, too?\"\r\nThen his brain waxed hot with mad hate. His hand clinched in a savage\r\nvow. \"I swear I will kill her before I will let her go to that man!\r\nTogether we will enter the spirit-world.\"\r\n\r\nHe sprang towards the door, but Mrs. Lambert, with eyes expanded in\r\nhorror, caught him by the arm. \"Tony, Tony! What are you doing? Are\r\nyou crazy?\"\r\n\r\nHer hand upon his arm, her face drawn and white with fear, recalled\r\nhim to himself. He laughed harshly. \"No--oh no; I'm not mad, but it's\r\nenough to make me so. I didn't mean it--of course I didn't mean it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are dreadfully wrought up, Tony. Go out and walk and clear your\r\nbrain, and by-and-by we'll sit for council.\"\r\n\r\nIn the end she again persuaded him to return to his chamber, but he\r\ndid not leave the house--neither could he rest. Every word the girl\r\nhad said of his selfishness, his egotism, burned like poison in his\r\nbrain. Had his hold on her been so slight, after all? \"She despises\r\nme. She hates me!\" And in his heart he despised and hated himself. He\r\ncursed his poverty, his lack of resource. \"Why am I, the evangel of\r\nthis faith, dependent on others for revelation. Why must I beg and\r\ncringe for money, for power?\" He was in the full surge of this flood\r\nof indignant query when Pratt shuffled into his room.\r\n\r\n\"Some reporters below want to see you. I guess you better--\"\r\n\r\nClarke turned, the glare of madness in his eyes. \"Curse you and your\r\nreporters! Go away from me! I don't want to be bothered by you nor by\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nPratt stared in dull surprise, which turned slowly to anger. \"What's\r\nthe matter with you _now_?\" he roared. \"Damn you, anyway. You've upset\r\nmy whole house with your crazy notions. Everything was moving along\r\nnicely till you got this bug of a big speech into your head, and then\r\neverything in my life turns topsy-turvy. To hell with you and your\r\nbook! You can't use me to advertise yourself. I want you to understand\r\nthat right now. I see your scheme, and it don't work with me.\"\r\n\r\nHe was urging himself into a frenzy--his jaws working, his eyes\r\nglittering, like those of a boar about to charge, all his concealed\r\ndislike, his jealousy of the preacher's growing fame and of his\r\ncontrol of Viola turning rapidly into hate. \"I don't know why you're\r\neating my bread,\" he shouted, hoarsely. \"I've put up with you as long\r\nas I am going to. You're nothing but a renegade preacher, a dead-beat,\r\nand a hypocrite. Get out before I kick you out!\"\r\n\r\nThis brought the miserable evangel to a stand. \"I'll go,\" he said,\r\ndefiantly, \"but I'll take your psychic with me--we'll go together.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go and be damned to the whole tribe of ye!\" retorted Pratt, purple\r\nwith fury. \"Go, and I'll publish you for a set o' leeches--that's what\r\nI'll do,\" and with this threat he turned on his heel and went out,\r\nleaving Clarke stupefied, blinded by the force of his imprecations.\r\n\r\nThe situation had taken another turn for the worse. To leave the house\r\nof his own will was bad enough; to be kicked out by his host, and to\r\nbe followed by his curse was desolating. \"And yet this I could endure\r\nif only she would speak to me--would go with me.\"\r\n\r\nHe fell at last into a deep gulf of self-pity. Yesterday, now so far\r\naway, so irrevocable, was full of faith, of promise, of happiness, of\r\ngrand purpose; now every path was hid by sliding sand. The world was a\r\nchaos. His book, his splendid mission, his communion with Adele, his\r\nvery life, depended upon this wondrous psychic. Without her the world\r\nwas a chaos, life a failure, and his faith a bitter, mocking lie. With\r\na sobbing groan he covered his face, his heart utterly gone, his brain\r\nbenumbed, his future black as night.\r\n\r\nAnd yet outside the window, in reach of his hand, the spring sunlight\r\nvividly fell. The waves of the river glittered like glass and ships\r\nmoved to and fro like butterflies. The sky was full of snowy\r\nclouds--harbingers of the warm winds of spring. Sparrows twittered\r\nalong the eaves, and the mighty city, with joy in its prosaic heart,\r\nwas pacing majestically into the new and pleasant month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nWHEN DOCTORS DISAGREE\r\n\r\n\r\nAt breakfast next morning Morton took up the paper with apprehension,\r\nand though he found Clarke's name spread widely on the page, he was\r\nrelieved to find only one allusion to the unknown psychic on whose\r\nmystic power the orator was depending.\r\n\r\n\"She has another day of grace,\" he said to himself, thinking of\r\nLambert.\r\n\r\nAll the way down to his laboratory he pretended to read the news, but\r\ncould not succeed in interesting himself in the wars and famines of\r\nthe world, so much more vital and absorbing were his own passions and\r\nretreats, so filmy was the abstract, so concrete and vital the\r\nparticular. A million children might be starving in India, a thousand\r\nvirgins about to be sold to slavery in Turkestan; but such\r\nintelligence counted little to a man struggling with doubt of the\r\nwoman he loves, and questioning further the right of any philosopher\r\nto marry and bring children into a life of bafflement and pain and\r\nultimate annihilation.\r\n\r\nThis must ever be so. The particular must outweigh the general, and\r\nphilosophers, even the monists, must continue to be inconsistent. The\r\nindividual must of necessity consider himself first and humanity\r\nafterwards; for if all men considered the welfare of the race to the\r\nneglect of self, the race would die at the root and the individual\r\nperish of his too-widely diffused pity. To be the altruist, one must\r\nfirst be the egoist (say the philosophers), to give, one must first\r\nhave.\r\n\r\nThe questions which filled this implacable young investigator's mind\r\nwere these: Is my love worthy? And again: Dare I, insisting on man's\r\nunity with all other organisms and subject to the same laws of\r\nextinction, entertain the idea of marriage? If the theories I hold are\r\ntrue--if the soul of a child is no more than the animating principle\r\nof the ant or the ape (and this I cannot deny)--then of what avail is\r\nhuman life? By what right do men bring other organisms into being\r\nknowing that they will only flutter a little while in the sun like\r\nbutterflies and die as unavailingly as moths?\r\n\r\nUp to this time he had accepted with a certain calm pitilessness the\r\nmost inexorable tenets of the evolutionists, and had defended them\r\nwith remorseless zeal; but on this fair spring morning, with love for\r\nViola stirring in his heart, he found himself far less disposed to\r\ncrush and confound. He acknowledged a growing sympathy with those who\r\nmourn the tragic fact of death.\r\n\r\nAll that he had read concerning clairvoyance, telepathy, hypnotism,\r\nand their allied subjects began to assume new significance and a\r\nweightier importance. He was annoyed to find himself profoundly\r\nconcerned as to whether the power of \"suggestion\" was anything like as\r\ncoercive as many eminent men believed it to be, and in this awakened\r\ninterest he 'phoned Tolman (upon reaching his desk), asking him to\r\nlunch with him at the club. \"If there is anything in his philosophy I\r\nwant to know it,\" he said, as he turned to his desk.\r\n\r\nHe found no word from Lambert, and this troubled him. \"If he does not\r\ncome to-day I must act alone,\" he concluded, and attempted to take up\r\nhis work, but found his brain preoccupied, his hand heavy.\r\n\r\nWeissmann came in late, looking old and worn. He, too, had passed a\r\nrestless night. He nodded curtly to his assistant and set to work\r\nwithout reference to the sitting or the psychic; and yet Morton was\r\nvery sure his chief's mind was as profoundly engaged as his own, and a\r\nlittle later in the forenoon he stopped at his desk and said: \"Lunch,\r\nwith me, doctor; I have asked Tolman, and I want to talk things over\r\nwith you both.\"\r\n\r\nWeissmann consented in blunt abstraction, and the work proceeded quite\r\nin the regular routine so far as he was concerned.\r\n\r\nTolman was the farthest remove from the traditional mesmerist in\r\nappearance, being a brisk, blond man of exceeding neatness and taste\r\nin dress. He wore the most fashionable clothing, his hair and beard\r\nwere in perfect order, and his hands were very beautiful. He was,\r\nindeed, vain of his slender fingers and gesticulated overmuch. His\r\nvoice also was a little over-assertive, but his eyes were clear,\r\nsteady, and strong.\r\n\r\nAs they took seats in the cheerful sunlit dining-room of the Mid-day\r\nClub, the three theorists formed a notable group and one that\r\nattracted general comment, but their conversation would have\r\nastonished the easygoing publishers and professional men who were\r\nchatting at neighboring tables, so full of interrogation and assertion\r\nwas each specialist.\r\n\r\nAs Tolman rose to speak to a friend at a table across the room,\r\nWeissmann confidentially remarked: \"I did not sleep last night, not a\r\nwink. I could not satisfy myself about those performances. Therefore I\r\nsmoked and studied. Last night's test proved nothing to me except that\r\nthe girl had nothing to do with the phenomena.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man's heart glowed at these words and he feelingly replied.\r\n\"To prove that would mean a great deal to me, doctor.\"\r\n\r\nWeissmann's tired face lighted up. \"So! Then you are interested in\r\nher? You love her? I was right, eh?\" he asked, with true German\r\ndirectness.\r\n\r\nServiss protested. \"Oh no! I haven't said that; but it troubled me to\r\nthink of her as a possible trickster. Please don't hint such a thing\r\nin Tolman's hearing.\"\r\n\r\nAs the hypnotist returned to his seat, Serviss opened up the special\r\ndiscussion by asking him his opinion of the claims of spiritualists.\r\n\r\nThis question threw Tolman into a roar. \"That from you, and in the\r\npresence of Weissmann, is a 'facer'! What has come over Morton\r\nServiss that he should invite me to a lunch to talk over a case of\r\nhysterico-epilepsy, and start in by asking my opinion of spiritualism?\r\nCome, now, out with the real question.\"\r\n\r\nServiss perceived the folly of any subterfuge, and briefly presented\r\nViola's history, without naming her, of course, and ended by\r\ndescribing in detail the sitting of the night before, while Tolman ate\r\nimperturbably at his chop and toast with only now and then a word or a\r\nkeen glance.\r\n\r\nWhen the story was finished, he looked up, like a lawyer assuming\r\ncharge of a witness. \"Now there's a whole volume to say upon what\r\nyou've told me, and our time is limited to a chapter. Make your\r\nquestions specific. What point do you particularly want my opinion\r\non?\"\r\n\r\n\"First of all, has the preacher in this case been controlling the\r\ngirl?\"\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly, but not to the extent you imagine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has the mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. She has been a great and constant source of suggestion.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would advise taking the patient out of her present surroundings,\r\nwould you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that would be helpful, but is not absolutely necessary. The\r\nessential step is to fill her mind with counter-suggestions.\" Here he\r\nlaunched into an exposition of the principles and potentialities of\r\nhypnotism, and was in full tide of it when Weissmann interrupted to\r\nask:\r\n\r\n\"But suppose these phenomena actually and independently exist? Suppose\r\nthat they are not illusions but objective realities, how then will\r\nyour suggestion help?\"\r\n\r\nThis put Tolman on his mettle. He entered into a discourse filled with\r\nphrases like \"secondary consciousness,\" \"collective hallucinations,\"\r\n\"nerve-force,\" wherein, while admitting that great and good men\r\nbelieved in the phenomena of \"spiritism,\" he concluded that they were\r\noverhasty in assigning causes. For his part, the realm of\r\nhallucination was boundless. \"The mind has the power to create a world\r\nof its own--it often does so, and--\"\r\n\r\nHere Weissmann again broke in. \"You will enroll yourself with Aksakof\r\nand Von Hartmann and Lombroso?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not precisely. They admit the reality of the appearances. I do not\r\nbelieve that the mind has power to dematerialize objects, as in the\r\ncase of your wine-glass last night, which was a trick.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the mind can produce a blister without external cause,\" said\r\nServiss. \"You hypnotic sharps have proved that it can also deaden\r\nnerves and heal skin diseases, if not bone fractures.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we produce marvellous cures within the organism, but we draw the\r\nline at the periphery of the body. Telekinesis is to me the word of a\r\nlively fictionist.\"\r\n\r\n\"One is as easy to believe as the other, and Crookes, Lodge, Lombroso,\r\nTamburini, Aksakof, Von Hartmann, all believe in the reality of these\r\nhappenings,\" retorted Serviss. \"They differ only in their\r\nexplanations. One party believes them due to disembodied spirits, the\r\nother relates them to the inexplicable action of a certain psychic\r\nforce generated within the sitters and acting on objects at a\r\ndistance. I am not yet persuaded of the phenomena, but I am\r\nprogressing. I am willing to admit that these gentlemen are entitled\r\nto a respectful hearing.\"\r\n\r\nTolman resumed his own explanation, and after several premises and\r\ngeneral statements put a case. \"For example, take automatic writing.\r\nYou begin by placing a pad and pencil before the mind. That suggests\r\nwriting--sets up a certain train of associated ideas. These ideas have\r\nthe innate tendency to realize themselves, the will of the subject\r\nbeing weakened. This is why the left hand is often used. These ideas\r\ndisassociate themselves from the rest of the mental organism and may,\r\nin highly developed cases, become what is called a 'secondary\r\npersonality.' They may give a weak imitation of discourse. They may\r\nassume a vague resemblance to some other individual, but they can\r\nnever give a full statement or a new statement. This is why all the\r\nso-called spirit communications are so fragmentary and so futile. The\r\ncure of any such state is to set up a strong current of\r\ncounter-suggestion.\"\r\n\r\nWeissmann asked: \"Is it not extravagant to say that there can exist in\r\nthe unconscious mind of a young girl, a skill so great as will enable\r\nher to draw intricate patterns, manipulate objects at a distance, and\r\nimpersonate dead persons unknown to her?\"\r\n\r\n\"But there you have passed into the region of hallucination or\r\ndeceit.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not so sure of that. I do not see how fraud or hallucination can\r\ncome into the most of what we saw last night. I will admit that coming\r\nalone by itself the test would have little weight; but it does not\r\ncome alone. The literature of the subject is great and growing.\"\r\n\r\nTolman smiled. \"Yes, the newspapers are filled with accounts of\r\nmediums exposed.\"\r\n\r\nThey entered then upon a discussion of the trance, and passed to a\r\nconsideration of multiple personality, which brought out many singular\r\nfacts. \"We learned also,\" Tolman said in discussion of a certain case\r\nwhich he had studied, \"that certain drugs have the power of arousing\r\nspecific nerve-centres, and that in cases of alternating personality\r\nby flooding the brain with blood we were able to bring back the normal\r\nself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doesn't that weaken your argument of the power of mind over matter?\"\r\nasked Serviss, profoundly interested in this assertion.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. It is my belief in the drug that influences the patient.\"\r\n\r\nServiss laughed and Weissmann's mouth twitched. \"You cannot head them\r\noff--these modern mind-specialists! They plunge into the subconscious\r\nlike prairie-dogs into the sod, only to come up at a new point.\"\r\n\r\nTolman's interest in the unknown psychic was now keen, and he asked\r\nfor a chance to try his powers.\r\n\r\nTo this Serviss was strongly averse. \"I have never had a chance at a\r\ncase of this kind and I would very much like to experiment. Perhaps I\r\nmay need you; but if suggestion is what you claim it to be, if the\r\npower is really in the mind of the subject, I can arouse it as well as\r\nany one. But as a believer in matter I would like to ally myself with\r\nthe drug you mention.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, here is the prescription.\" He jotted down on a card a few\r\nhieroglyphic phrases. \"And now I must hurry away. I'm sorry, but I\r\nhave an engagement.\"\r\n\r\nServiss took his hand cordially. \"I'm glad to have had this talk with\r\nyou. It has suggested a new train of thought to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you need me on the case you mention, be sure to let me know. It\r\nsounds mighty interesting, and I'd like a hand in it.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Tolman left, Weissmann remarked: \"There is a school of thinkers\r\nwhich believes that exceptional individuals may have the power to\r\neffect molecular changes in matter at a distance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know that. I spent most of the night reading the Proceedings\r\nof the Society for Psychical Research, in which that theory has a\r\nlarge place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, may it not be that Miss Lambert has this power? May it not be\r\nthat she is able in some such way as that suggested by Lombroso, to\r\nimpart cerebral movements to the ether and so modify matter as to\r\nproduce movement of objects, telekinetic writing, and all the rest of\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is too violent an assumption. We might as well surrender to the\r\nspiritists at once. What evidence have we that Clarke did not rise and\r\ntiptoe about the room manipulating the horn himself?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have our own observation, joined to the report of Crookes and\r\nRichet.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Crookes is discredited on this score. He belongs to what Haeckel\r\ncalls 'the imaginative scientists.' So do Von Hartmann, Lombroso,\r\nWallace, and Lodge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should that be? Why should we accept their testimony on gases and\r\nthe spectrum, and exclude it when it comes to a question of phenomena\r\nnew to us? 'This man is a great chemist and physicist,' you say,'but a\r\ncrazy ass when he sets to work to examine the claims of spiritism,'\r\nwhich is absurd and unjust. So far as I can see, he examined the\r\nphenomena of spiritism quite as a scientist should.\"\r\n\r\nMorton believed that his chief was taking the opposing side out of\r\nperversity and replied: \"I admit that as you read, they seem\r\nreasonable, and I also admit that the experiments with Eusapia,\r\nespecially the recent ones, ought to be conclusive to my mind, but\r\nthey are not. That is the singular thing--they do not convince.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is because we do not clear our minds of prejudice. These men are\r\nfar-sighted and profound in their own lines. They have exposed\r\nthemselves to sneers by going into these new fields. They are to be\r\nhonored as pioneers. Why not believe the phenomena they discuss are at\r\nleast worth our attention?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is Clarke's plea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely! And he is right. I am less critical of him to-day than I\r\nwas last night. He gave his psychic over into our hands. What more\r\ncould we ask?\"\r\n\r\n\"He might have absented himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"He may do that next time.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; he was furious when I suggested the idea.\"\r\n\r\n\"My interest is awakened. It may be, as Clarke says, that this young\r\nlady is about to give the world of science a new outlook. It may be\r\nthat she is to out-do Home and Eusapia.\"\r\n\r\nMorton's face was cold and his voice firm as he said: \"Not if I can\r\nprevent it. My zeal as an investigator does not go so far as that. I\r\nintend to free her from all connection with this uneasy world, and to\r\nthat end I have wired her step-father to come on, and with his\r\nassistance I hope to end Clarke's control of her and set to work upon\r\nthe cure she expects of me.\"\r\n\r\nWeissmann smiled indulgently. \"The scientist is defeated by the lover.\r\nI see; you would exclude all others from the sitting. Very well! that\r\nshall be as you wish; but it seems a shame now when we have such a\r\nwonderful chance to duplicate the Crookes' experiments. But, as you\r\nsay, it would be too much to ask of a young and lovely girl. We will\r\nsacrifice only men and the ugly crones, eh?\" Morton smiled faintly\r\nand his chief went on: \"Well, now, in case you find yourself\r\nsitting--\" he held up a warning hand--\"I say if you find yourself\r\nunable to stop these trances--\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no doubt of that--provided I can take her out of her present\r\nassociations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good! I was about to say that all, or nearly all, of the\r\nphenomena of last night took place within a limited radius of the\r\npsychic. The books all came from behind her. The horn hovered near\r\nher--all of which would support the arguments of the 'psychic force'\r\nadvocates. Lombroso and Tamburini both suggest that it is not absurd\r\nto say that possibly the subconscious mind may be able not merely to\r\ntransmit energy, but to produce phantasmal forms, and I wondered last\r\nnight whether there might not be some supernormal elongation of the\r\npsychic's arms which might enable her to seize and manipulate the horn\r\nat a distance beyond her normal reach.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is easier for me to believe that Mrs. Lambert did it. I am\r\nconvinced that Clarke in some way played us false.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not sure of that. I am willing to grant that it is possible for\r\nthe mind to alter the circulation of the blood, even to accelerate or\r\ndecrease the up-building processes among the cells. If the mind can\r\nproduce a pathologic process like a blister, it can also remove warts\r\nor cancer, as the hypnotists of the Charcot school claim. If the mind\r\ncan move a book or a pencil without the intervention of any known form\r\nof matter, then Clarke (as well as his psychic) may be innocent, and\r\nall that happened last night be due to thought-transference and\r\ntelekinesis.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man shrugged his shoulders. \"To admit a single one of your\r\npremises would turn all our science upside down.\"\r\n\r\nWeissmann smiled musingly. \"So said the Ptolmaic philosophers when\r\nCopernicus came. Yet nothing was destroyed but error--they established\r\nthe truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't mean what I said, exactly. I meant that the whole theory is\r\nopposed to every known law of physics.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not so certain of that, I can imagine a subtler form of force\r\nthan magnetism. I can imagine the mind reacting upon matter, creating\r\nin its own right by the displacement and rearrangement of the\r\nmolecules of a substance--say of wood. What is a wine-glass but an\r\nappearance? No, no! It will not do to be dogmatic. We must not assume\r\ntoo much. We must keep open minds. Are we not advancing? Is any one\r\nnearing the farther wall? No, my boy, each year should make us less\r\narrogant. Ten thousand years from now men will still be discovering\r\nnew laws of nature just as they were ten thousand years ago. It is\r\nchildish to suppose that we or any other generation will know all that\r\nis to be known. Infinite research is before us just as infinite\r\npainful groping is behind us. I do not assume to say what the future\r\nwill bring to mankind. Perhaps soon--very soon, science will shift its\r\nentire battle-line from matter to mind. To say the mind is conditioned\r\nin a certain way to-day does not mean that these conditions may not\r\nutterly change to-morrow. Great discoveries wait in the future.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you would not say that a new way of squaring the circle would\r\nappear--or that perpetual motion--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, no! Error is not a product of enlightenment. I only say that\r\nthe problem which is insoluble to you and to me may be quite simple to\r\nthe biologist of the twenty-second century. Once I thought I might\r\ncome to know much of the universe, now I am quite certain I shall\r\nnever know but a few processes--never the mystery itself.\"\r\n\r\nAs the old man talked with the light of prophecy in his gaunt face,\r\nthe young man's imagination took wing into the future, that mighty and\r\nalluring void, black as night, yet teeming with transcendent,\r\npotential unborn men and women, and his brain grew numb with the\r\neffort and his heart humble with the moments' prophetic glance. Ay, it\r\nwas true! He in his turn would seem a child of the foolish past--a\r\nfond old man to the wise future. His complacence was lost. His faith\r\nin his authorities violently shaken. He recalled a line from Whitman:\r\n\"Beyond every victory there are other battles to be fought, other\r\nvictories to be won.\" And his eyes grew dim and his thought filled\r\nwith reverence for those seers of the future, and with awe of the\r\ninscrutable and ever-beckoning and ever-retiring mystery of life.\r\n\r\nHis chief resumed: \"No, we pretend to larger knowledge of living\r\norganisms; but how will our text-books be regarded by the teachers of\r\nthe future? Will they not read us and smile over us as curious\r\nmixtures of truth and error--valuable as showing the state of science\r\nin our day? Do you dream of solving the mystery of life? Of bridging\r\nthe chasm between the crystal and the non-nucleated cell? I do not. As\r\nI sat alone last night unable to sleep, my eyes ran over the backs of\r\nthe books on my shelves--they were all there, all the great ones,\r\nLaplace, Spinoza, Descartes, Goethe, Spencer, Hegel, Kant, Darwin, all\r\nthe wonder-workers. How masterful each had been in his time. How\r\ncomplacent of praise; how critical of the past! But here now they all\r\nstood gathering dust, and I thought: so will the unborn philosophers\r\nof the next century fold me up and put me away beside the other mouldy\r\nones--curious but no longer useful. My book will be but an empty shell\r\non the reef of human history. Of such cruelty are the makers of\r\nscientific advance.\"\r\n\r\nMorton was profoundly moved by the note of pathos, of disillusionment\r\nin the old man's voice. \"Would you have me believe that these men we\r\ndoubt to-day are forerunners of the future?\"\r\n\r\n\"I feel so. The materialists have had their day. Some subtler\r\nexpression of matter is about to be given to the world, not as Kant\r\ngave it, but through experiment, and to men like Myers and Sir William\r\nCrookes may come great honor some day.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would not have us weaken in our method?\"\r\n\r\nWeissmann's manner changed. He resumed his most peremptory tone. \"By\r\nno means. We must not relax our vigilant scrutiny of fact one atom's\r\nweight, but we must keep our minds open to new messages--no matter how\r\nrepulsive the source.\"\r\n\r\nMorton sat for a moment in deep study, then said: \"If I fail to stop\r\nthe public announcement of Miss Lambert's powers, if Clarke's\r\nchallenge is issued in spite of my protest, I shall ask the privilege\r\nof heading the committee in order to be present and shield her. If it\r\ncomes to this, will you join me and support me?\"\r\n\r\n\"With pleasure.\"\r\n\r\n\"But suppose the president and our board object?\"\r\n\r\n\"What right have they to object? So long as I do not neglect my duties\r\nthey will not dare to object.\"\r\n\r\n\"They will be scandalized. Two of us going into an investigation of\r\nthis sort will seem to involve the whole school, and they may insist\r\non our keeping out of it, so long as we are connected with the\r\ninstitution. If they ask for our resignation, the public will side\r\nwith us, but all other institutions, and probably the bulk of our\r\ncolleagues, will go against us. I hesitate, therefore, to ask you to\r\ntake up this work. It is not a matter of bread and butter to me. I can\r\nresign, and I am thinking this is my best plan. At the same time I\r\nhope, for Miss Lambert's sake, that the public test will not be made.\"\r\n\r\nWeissmann's shaggy old head lifted like that of a musing lion. \"What\r\nis this opposition to me? I too can resign. What my colleagues say\r\nwill not matter if I feel that I am advancing the cause of science.\r\nTheir flames will scorch, but I have a thick skin. Besides, I am old,\r\nwith only a few more years to work, and if I felt I could better serve\r\nthe world by going into this investigation than by remaining in the\r\none in which I now am, I would gladly do it. I will not utterly\r\nstarve.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not while I am able to share a crust,\" quickly exclaimed Serviss. \"If\r\nthey ask for your resignation, give it and come with me. Together we\r\nwill found an institute for the study of the supra-normal. What do you\r\nsay?\"\r\n\r\nWeissmann's eyes glowed with the quenchless zeal of the\r\nexperimentalist. \"My dear boy, I would resign now for that purpose;\r\nbut I hope it will not be necessary, for your sake.\"\r\n\r\nThey shook hands like two adventurers setting out on their joint\r\nexploration of a distant and difficult country; but this moment of\r\nexaltation was followed in Serviss's mind by a sense of having in some\r\nway dedicated Viola to the advancement of science rather than to the\r\nsecurity of the fireside and to the joys of wife and mother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nLAMBERT INTERVENES\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon his return to his desk Serviss was delighted to find a telegram\r\nfrom Lambert, stating the time of his arrival, and asking for a\r\nmeeting. There was a note of decision, almost command, in the wording\r\nof the despatch, which denoted that the miner had taken his warning to\r\nheart and was prepared for prompt and authoritative action.\r\n\r\nThe time of the train being near, Serviss closed the lid of his desk\r\nand took a car for the station--immensely relieved of responsibility,\r\nyet worn and troubled by a multitude of confused and confusing\r\nspeculations. All the way to the depot, and while he stood waiting\r\noutside the gates, he pondered on the surprising change in Weissmann's\r\nthought, and also upon the momentous covenant between them. More than\r\never before he felt the burden and the mystery of organic life. Around\r\nhim flowed an endless stream of humankind, rushing, spreading--each\r\ndrop in the flood an immortal soul (according to the spiritist),\r\nattended by invisible guardians, watching, upholding, warning--\"and\r\nthe whole earth swarms with a billion other similar creatures with the\r\nsame needs, the same destiny; for, after all, the difference between\r\na Zulu and a Greek is not much greater than that between a\r\npurple-green humming-bird and a canary; and to think that this wave of\r\nman appearing to-day on the staid old earth, like the swarms of\r\ninnumerable insects of June, is but one of a million other waves of a\r\nmillion other years. To consider, furthermore, that all those who have\r\nlived and died are still sentient! What a staggering, monstrous\r\nconception! Nor is this all. According to the monist conception there\r\nis no line at which we can say here the animal stops and the soul of\r\nman begins, so that ants and apes are claimants for immortality. If\r\nthe individual man persists after death, why not his faithful collie?\r\nNo, this theory will not do. It is far less disturbing to think of all\r\nthese hurrying bipeds as momentary nodes of force--minute eddies on\r\nthe boundless stream of ether.\"\r\n\r\nThe gates opened and another river of travellers, presumably from the\r\ngreat plains of the Middle West, poured forth, quite undistinguishable\r\nin general appearance from those which had preceded them; and,\r\ndropping his speculation, Morton peered among these faces, not quite\r\nsure that he would know Lambert if he saw him. As a matter of fact, he\r\nwould have missed him had not the miner laid a hand upon his arm,\r\nsaying, quaintly: \"Howdy, professor, howdy! What's the state of the\r\nprecinct?\"\r\n\r\nHe was quite conventional in all outward signs, save for his red-brown\r\ncomplexion and the excessive newness of his hand-bag. \"How are all\r\nthe folks?\" he went on to ask, with a keen glance.\r\n\r\n\"They were quite well when I saw them, but they need you. You're not\r\nan hour too soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it as bad as that?\" he exclaimed, anxiously. \"What is it all\r\nabout?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait till we reach a carriage, then I'll put you in possession of all\r\nthe facts,\" replied Serviss, and led the way to a cab. \"I am greatly\r\nrelieved to see you to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"I came as soon as your wire reached me; but the messenger arrived\r\nduring a big snow-storm, and the trail was impassable for a day. Now,\r\nthen, professor, let's have the whole story,\" he said, as the driver\r\nslammed the door. \"Where are they and what is the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are here in New York, housed with a man named Pratt, a wealthy\r\nspiritist, and they are in excellent bodily health, but your daughter\r\nis threatened with a publicity which is most dangerous.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Clarke has decided to give an oration in the Spirit Temple announcing\r\nhis faith and defying the unbeliever. As the climax of this discourse\r\nhe intends to announce your daughter's name and her willingness to\r\nmeet any test. She objects to this publicity, but Pratt, your wife,\r\nand the 'guides' all unite in forcing her into acquiescence.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" said Lambert, reflectively. \"When does this speech come\r\noff?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sunday morning at eleven.\"\r\n\r\n\"I reckon I can stop that,\" was the miner's laconic comment.\r\n\r\n\"But this is not the only danger,\" Serviss hurried on to say. \"This\r\nman Pratt is a rankly selfish old man, who is surrounded by flatterers\r\nand those who live off his desire to commune with his dead wife and\r\ndaughters. He is accustomed to have his own private 'mediums' and to\r\nappropriate their entire time and energy till he is weary of them--or\r\ntill a new one comes to his knowledge--then it is his pitiless habit\r\nto 'expose' them and throw them into the street. He is the worst\r\npossible man for your daughter to know, and to be in his house is a\r\nmisfortune.\"\r\n\r\n\"How does she happen to be there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Clarke took them there. He was eager to secure Pratt's endorsement of\r\nyour daughter, and also of the book he is about to publish. Your\r\ndaughter hates Pratt, and is very anxious to leave, but is afraid to\r\ndo so for fear of him and of her 'controls.' Pratt has threatened to\r\ndenounce her if she leaves him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he in love with her?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think so--not in the way you mean. He is bound up in her\r\npowers, and would do anything to keep her. But she must be taken away\r\nat once and Clarke's oration stopped. I would have interfered, but I\r\nhad no authority to act. Your wife is satisfied to remain, and the\r\n'chief control,' her father, insists upon their remaining, and Clarke\r\ntold me last night that your daughter was his affianced wife. You can\r\nsee how helpless I am, even though your daughter in her normal mood\r\nbegged me to save her from madness. I regard her condition as very\r\ncritical. To expose her to a public trial of her powers may unsettle\r\nher reason.\"\r\n\r\nLambert was profoundly moved by Morton's rapid statement. \"What would\r\nyou advise me to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Take her away from that house and Clarke's influence instantly, no\r\nmatter if your wife opposes it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are we on our way there now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we'll be there in a few minutes. My sister likes your wife and\r\ndaughter and has invited them to stay with her for a few days. This\r\nthey have promised to do. I suggest, therefore, that you take them\r\nimmediately to our home and so get your daughter into a totally\r\ndifferent mental atmosphere. This plan will give you time to decide on\r\nfuture action.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do they know I'm coming?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I was afraid you might not come, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad you didn't tell them. I wanted to test whether that ghostly\r\ngrandfather would inform them. I'm mightily obliged to you,\r\nprofessor,\" he said, after a pause, and his eyes were moist with his\r\nemotion. \"I never had a child of my own, and I'm fond of Viola. I've\r\nalways resented this mediumistic business--she's too fine to be\r\nspoiled by it--but she wasn't mine, and Julia was so wrapped up in the\r\nfaith I couldn't stop it. Then Clarke came, and Julia minded what I\r\nsaid no more than if I'd been a chipmunk. So I climbed into the hills\r\nand stayed there.\"\r\n\r\n\"You believe in your daughter's powers?\"\r\n\r\n\"In her powers, yes; but not in every voice that speaks through her.\r\nHave you attended any of her sittings?\"\r\n\r\n\"We had one in my house last night. I laid the burden of the\r\nperformance to Clarke. He was the juggler.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, you're wrong there. I have cause enough to hate Clarke, but\r\nhe's honest. No, the power is all in Viola. I've had those things go\r\non with nobody but Julia and the girl in the room. No, Clarke is a\r\ncrazy fool in some ways, but he don't cheat.\"\r\n\r\nHis words were so direct, so weighted with conviction, that their\r\nforce staggered Serviss, causing him to doubt his new explanation.\r\nTolman's generalizations ceased at the moment to convince.\r\n\r\nLambert went on. \"I suppose she _is_ committed to him. She wrote me\r\nthat she guessed she might as well; so long as she was a medium nobody\r\nelse would ever want her--or something like that. I feel guilty, I'll\r\nadmit, but you see how it was. The girl belongs to Julia, and since\r\nClarke came into the family our correspondence has been pretty well\r\nconfined to checks on my part and receipts on hers; but she's had\r\nplenty of money, professor. There wasn't any need of her going into\r\nanybody's house. She could have gone to the best hotels--\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see how you could have acted differently,\" said Serviss, with\r\nintent to comfort. \"But I am sure that Viola\"--he spoke the name with\r\na little hesitation--\"will eagerly go with you now. She begins to\r\ndoubt Clarke and to realize the fearful mental peril in which she\r\nstands.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what I don't understand, professor. This spiritualistic faith\r\nis mighty pretty on the face of it, but it seems to unhinge people's\r\nminds. I've known two or three to go 'locoed' with it; that's what\r\nkept me from interfering. It isn't for miners to monkey with; but I\r\nwas in hopes that you would go into it. In fact, I was in hopes you'd\r\ngot sort o' interested in Viola, and she in you, and that you'd help\r\nher someway.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am interested in her,\" replied Serviss, quickly, \"and I want to\r\nhelp her; but so long as she is where she is, and acknowledges\r\nClarke's claims, I can do nothing.--Here we are!\"\r\n\r\nAs they drew up before the looming front of Pratt's house the miner\r\nwhistled, \"Must be one of those Wall Street pirates we read about.\r\nNothing spirit-like about this castle, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor about its lord.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, this beats the Palace Hotel in Salina,\" he continued, his wonder\r\nincreasing, then he smiled. \"What'll you bet I don't catch the\r\n'guides' napping! You send up word you're here and leave me out o'\r\nsight somewhere. I'd like to show Julia that her daddy don't know all\r\nthat blows over the roof.\"\r\n\r\nAgain Serviss doubted the husband's ability to dominate the forces in\r\nopposition--so small and inoffensive did he seem and so ill-timed was\r\nhis joke.\r\n\r\nThe colored man, more funereally dignified than before, showed them\r\ninto the reception-room. \"I'm afraid the ladies are out, sir, but if\r\nyou'll wait a moment I'll see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be sure Mrs. Lambert gets my card,\" said Serviss, with a note of\r\nwarning in his voice. After the man left the room he turned to\r\nLambert. \"Pratt has a habit of intercepting the cards of visitors, and\r\ndeciding who shall and who shall not see your daughter. He hates me\r\nand may order me out of the house.\" As they listened, the master's\r\ndeep grumbling vibrated through the ceiling. \"You see! my card has\r\ngone to him, not to your wife. The old ruffian is probably giving\r\ninstructions to have me shown the door.\"\r\n\r\nTo this Lambert made no reply other than to say: \"We'll soon know, the\r\nnigger is returning.\"\r\n\r\nSome shade of the master's mood was reflected in the voice of the\r\nservant, as he said: \"The ladies are out and Mr. Pratt is engaged.\" He\r\nhad the air of waiting for them to go.\r\n\r\n\"Out, are they?\" remarked Lambert, casually. \"Then we'll wait till\r\nthey come in. When did you say they'll return?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't say, sir; probably not till very late.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is Clarke in?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, sir. I think not.\"\r\n\r\n\"But your boss is in?\"\r\n\r\nThe man hesitated. \"Yes, sir; but I told you he's engaged.\"\r\n\r\nLambert changed his tone. \"Now, see here, Charley, you go right back\r\nand tell him that Joe Lambert, of Fremont Basin, is here on business,\r\nand would like to have a word with him if he don't mind.\"\r\n\r\nThe colored man saw a light, and visibly weakened. \"I--I'll tell him,\"\r\nhe stammered, and retired.\r\n\r\nLambert followed him to the door and called after him, in a clear\r\ntone: \"You tell him to come down or I'll go up. Now mind you say just\r\nthose words.\"\r\n\r\nMorton smiled with joy in Lambert's decisive utterance. \"So much for\r\nhaving authority, as well as the will to act!\"\r\n\r\nPratt appeared at the head of the stairs. \"What is it now, Jenkins?\"\r\n\r\n\"The gentleman insists on seeing you, sir; it's Mr. Lambert.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay where you are,\" commanded Pratt, \"I'll come down and see what's\r\nwanted.\"\r\n\r\nLambert, with quiet, upturned face, watched the master of the house\r\ndescend slowly step by step, and Morton, contrasting the two men,\r\nawaited the collision with rising apprehension. The Western man seemed\r\nso small, so inoffensive in manner, in contrast with the grizzled,\r\ninsolent face of the sullen old man approaching with heavy jaw set at\r\na bull-dog angle. \"Well, sir, what is it?\" he contemptuously inquired.\r\n\r\nLambert waited so long that his questioner began to wonder, and then\r\nremarked, quietly: \"So you're Pratt!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm Joe Lambert, of Fremont, and I've come to relieve you of\r\nthe keep of my wife and daughter.\" Nothing could have been more\r\ntelling, more admirable, than his tone. Every word told, and as Pratt\r\nstood in a daze of surprise Lambert turned to the servant. \"Now,\r\nGeorge, you try again. You tell Mrs. Lambert her husband wants to see\r\nher, and you may ask Clarke to come along. I want a word or two with\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait!\" called Pratt. \"I want to know--\"\r\n\r\nLambert pointed a finger like a pistol. \"You _go_!\" and the man went.\r\nThe Westerner then turned to the owner of the house and said: \"Out\r\nwhere I live a husband has some rights which he can enforce if he is\r\nminded to do so. I haven't looked after my family as closely as I\r\nmight, but I'm going to do better hereafter. I believe my wife and\r\ndaughter are in this house, and I intend to see them, and your wishes\r\ndon't count in the matter. I'd advise you not to interfere.\"\r\n\r\nPratt began to retreat. \"I didn't know--\"\r\n\r\n\"But suppose you didn't--what right have you to supervise my wife's\r\naffairs? Why didn't you send Professor Serviss's card to her? What\r\nbusiness had you to say she was out?\"\r\n\r\nPratt came down from his lofty pose. \"So many strangers insist on\r\nseeing the psychic--\"\r\n\r\n\"But Professor Serviss is not a stranger, and, furthermore, unless my\r\nwife's mind has weakened, she's quite competent to turn down any one\r\nshe don't want to see. I can't understand why she is here, but I\r\nintend to find out. So long as she bears my name I don't want her to\r\nbe under any obligation to a man of your stamp.\"\r\n\r\nThere was power and a quiet dignity in the little man, and Pratt began\r\nto plead his case. \"I've tried to make it comfortable for them, and\r\nhelp on their work--\"\r\n\r\nLambert looked up and down the splendid hall, and in a softer tone\r\nreplied: \"So far I'm in your debt, but I don't like it. I am able to\r\nprovide for my family and I don't intend to share their supervision\r\nwith you nor any other man. So far as I know, my wife still considers\r\nme the head of the family--anyhow, that's what I'm here to find out.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lambert appeared at the head of the stairs and called, in a\r\ntremulous voice: \"Is that you, Joe?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is, Julia. Come down.\"\r\n\r\nViola, with a cry of joy, left her mother's side and running down the\r\nsteps, flung herself into Lambert's arms like a frightened child. \"Oh,\r\nPapa-Joe--I'm so glad to see you!\"\r\n\r\nLambert was astonished by the warmth of her greeting, and while she\r\nhid her face on his shoulder patted her awkwardly with soothing words\r\nof endearment until at last she lifted her pale and tear-wet face and\r\nwhispered:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's been a terrible day--take me away, quick!\"\r\n\r\nLambert looked up at his wife. \"Julia, what's been going on here? You\r\nboth look like the dead.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lambert's face was wrinkled and haggard and wan like that of one\r\ngrown suddenly old, and Morton was aware that her serenity was utterly\r\ngone before she spoke. Her voice was weak and piteous. \"I thought it\r\nwas all for the best, Joe. I followed the 'guides'--\"\r\n\r\n\"Follow them a little longer and you'll all land in the mad-house,\" he\r\nreplied. Then to Viola he tenderly said: \"Don't you worry any more,\r\ngirlie. Old Papa-Joe's going to take you home.\"\r\n\r\nServiss spoke. \"You're to come to us to-night. Kate expects you both.\"\r\n\r\nAt the sound of his voice Viola turned with an impulsive reaching of\r\nthe hands. \"Oh, Dr. Serviss, that would be heavenly! I love your\r\nsister and her beautiful home.\"\r\n\r\nLambert issued his command. \"Get your outfits together. I don't\r\nunderstand how you got here, but you're going to get out with me\r\nwithin the next half-hour.\"\r\n\r\nViola's spirit rose like flame. \"We're all ready--this moment. I sent\r\nour trunks away this morning. They went to the West Park. I'll be down\r\ninstantly,\" and she turned to run up the stairs, just as Clarke\r\nappeared at their head. His face was white and wild and his voice\r\nhoarse with fear and reproach as he intercepted her.\r\n\r\n\"What has happened? Who is below?\"\r\n\r\n\"My step-father,\" she answered, curtly, and fled away to her room.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lambert was about to follow when she saw Clarke descending, and\r\ndrew back with a look of appeal at her husband. It was evident to\r\nServiss that her confidence in Clarke had given place to fear.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time Pratt had been standing meditatively swaying to\r\nand fro on his feet, chewing upon something which he held far back in\r\nhis cheek. He resembled a sullen, chained, and vindictive elephant\r\nmeditating murder. He watched Clarke descend the stairs with very\r\nlittle change of expression; but Lambert's face darkened as the\r\nminister called out:\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"That does not concern you,\" he replied, and his voice cut. \"Your\r\ncontrol of my household stops right here! Julia, go get your things.\"\r\nHe laid an imperative hand on Clarke's arm. \"Clear the way for her!\"\r\n\r\nWith a look of alarm Mrs. Lambert started to follow her daughter.\r\n\"Don't be harsh, Joe.\" Then to Clarke she said, pleadingly: \"It's\r\nbest, Anthony, for a little while. Viola is so nervous and morbid.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know what it means,\" he passionately answered. \"It means the wreck\r\nof all my hopes. It means ruin to all my plans--\"\r\n\r\nLambert again interfered. \"Julia! get dressed. I will attend to Mr.\r\nClarke.\" As she hurried up the stairs he turned to Morton in apology.\r\n\"I've been to blame for this separation. I should have asserted my\r\nrights before. No man has the right to shirk his family duty. My duty\r\nwas to look after the welfare of my wife and daughter, and now see\r\ntheir faces! This year has made Julia an old woman.\" His voice\r\nchoked. When he could speak he addressed himself to Clarke. \"You\r\npromised me that you wouldn't use the girl's name in any way, and yet\r\nI'm told you're about to publish it broadcast.\"\r\n\r\n\"The control consents--\"\r\n\r\nHere Lambert's wrath broke bonds. \"Damn the control! I don't consent.\r\nAnd I serve notice on you, and on you too\"--he directed a menacing\r\nlook upon Pratt--\"to respect the name of my wife as well as that of my\r\ndaughter. Clarke has lived long enough in the West to know what I\r\nmean, but I'll explain to you.\" He faced Pratt, and with easy, almost\r\ngentle utterance, continued: \"I've spent some thirty-five years on the\r\nborder, where a man is called upon now and then to serve as his own\r\njudge, jury, and hangman. Perhaps we're a little prone to take matters\r\ninto our own hands; but be that as it may, the professor here has\r\nposted me about you and your ways, and I merely want to state, once\r\nfor all, that if you utter one word public or private against my wife\r\nor daughter I'll kill you as I would a wolf.\"\r\n\r\nThe slow pulsing flow of the miner's voice, the absence of all oaths\r\nor justifying gesture, froze Pratt into immobility and thrilled\r\nServiss with joy, for he, too, perceived that every word came from the\r\nheart of a very determined and very dangerous man.\r\n\r\nClarke started forward. \"You wrong me! Everything I have done has been\r\nfor their good--for the good of the world.\"\r\n\r\nLambert stopped him with a gesture. \"Right here you quit, my friend.\r\nI don't question your good intentions, but I'm sick of the whole crazy\r\nbusiness, and so is Julia. Why, good God, man! she looks ten years\r\nolder since she left the valley. You've been nothing but a curse to\r\nher and the girl from the very start, and here is where your trail\r\nforks.\"\r\n\r\nThe preacher's hollow cheeks were ashen gray and his throat thick with\r\npassion as he cried: \"You can't do that! You must not separate us. I\r\nlove her--she is mine! The spirit forces have promised her to me. They\r\nwill resent your interference, they will over-ride your puny\r\nopposition.\"\r\n\r\n\"I take the consequences. They go and you stay!\"\r\n\r\nClarke turned to Morton in a frenzy, his eyes flaming, his lips dry\r\nand contorted. \"I see your hand in this! You stand there silent, but\r\nyou are the machinator of this plot. You are stealing her away--\"\r\n\r\n\"Be quiet!\" commanded Morton, with a gesture towards the stairway.\r\n\"Don't you see them coming?\"\r\n\r\nViola, fully dressed, and breathless with eagerness to flee, was\r\nhurriedly descending.\r\n\r\nAs she neared him, Clarke cried out, with lamentable, despairing wail:\r\n\"Viola, you are leaving me!\"\r\n\r\nShe gave him one awed, pitying backward glance and passed on, hurrying\r\nas if to escape his outspread hand, swift to outrun the inevitable\r\ntragic shadow of his faith.\r\n\r\nFor an instant he reeled back against the wall, then sprang to\r\nfollow, but the young scientist intervened and thrust him back.\r\n\r\n\"Keep to your own trail,\" he sternly said, and as he opened the door\r\nfor the girl, she seemed to pass at once into the sunlit spring-time\r\nworld of common life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nSERVISS ASSUMES CONTROL\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the carriage-door Mrs. Lambert halted, her heart sorely smitten by\r\nthe vision of Clarke's agonized face. \"Wait a moment!\" she cried out.\r\n\"We were too cruel. Let me say good-bye.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Lambert replied, firmly. \"You are done with him.\" And with these\r\nwords he gently assisted her into the coach. \"Get in, professor,\" he\r\nadded, with a touch of the same command. \"We must be moving.\"\r\n\r\nWith a succinct phrase of direction to the driver, Serviss complied,\r\ntaking the front seat, opposite Viola. He was horrified to find her\r\nshaking violently as if with cold, her face white, her eyes big and\r\nwild. Her physical rescue was accomplished, but it was immediately\r\nmade plain to him that the invisible bonds which linked her to Clarke\r\nwere being drawn upon with merciless power, for with the first motion\r\nof the vehicle she fixed a look of terror and entreaty upon her\r\nmother, exclaiming, huskily: \"They are calling me! They will not let\r\nme go.\"\r\n\r\nLambert stared in helpless dismay as he realized the force of this\r\ninner struggle; but the young scientist, filled with fierce rage at\r\nthis assertion of the dark forces, met them promptly in pride of his\r\nown resources, his own desire.\r\n\r\n\"Give me your hands!\" he commanded, sharply. She obeyed like a child\r\nin a stupor of pain, her breath coming through her pallid lips with a\r\nhissing sound as if she were sinking each moment deeper into an icy\r\nflood.\r\n\r\nWith both her inert hands in his, with love and mastering will in his\r\neyes, he bent a deep, piercing gaze upon her with intent to rouse her\r\nand sustain her. \"You must not give way. You are too strong, too\r\nbrave, to yield to this delusion. You are clear of it all\r\nnow--entering upon a free and happy life.... Think of the new\r\nconditions into which you are going.... Kate is waiting you. No one\r\ncan control you if you set your will sharply against it.... Remember\r\nthe Marshall Basin and the splendid sunshine.... You are leaving all\r\nhateful, evil influences behind.\" In this way he labored to fill her\r\nmind with new conceptions, building up in her a will to resist, and as\r\nhe felt the tremor die out of her hands and saw the color coming back\r\ninto her face he smiled with a sense of victory. \"You see!\" he\r\nresumed, in triumph. \"You are better. Your hands are warmer. You are\r\nbreathing naturally again. Your enemies are being left behind.\"\r\n\r\nIt was true. The hunted, piteous look had left her eyes. She seemed\r\ndrowsy, but it was the languor of relief. The vital force, the sanity,\r\nthe imperious appeal of the man before her had rolled back the cloud\r\nof fear which had all but closed over her head. He released her hands,\r\nsaying: \"We must have no more backward glances. Remember Lot's wife.\"\r\n\r\nLambert, filled with satisfaction, laid a silencing hand upon his\r\nwife's arm. His faith in science, in the force of exact learning, was\r\nbeing met, and he was resolved to leave the hypnotist free to act, to\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nRoused and confident, the young scientist continued his appeal,\r\nleaving her no time to dwell upon the past. \"You are young,\" he said\r\nin effect, \"and it is spring. You are false to yourself if you permit\r\nyourself to lose through any such morbid imagining a single hour of\r\njoy. All depends on your own will, your own desire to be free.\r\nHenceforth you are never to be sad or afraid. I will you to be happy\r\nand you must obey.\"\r\n\r\nShe rose from the deep of her depression as a lily rises from the sod\r\nafter the trampling storm-wind has passed. Her response to his call\r\nfilled him with hope as well as with astonishment. It was as if he had\r\ntorn from her throat the hands of some hideous beast, half-man,\r\nhalf-devil, and they entered Kate's home in such normal, cheerful\r\nrelationship that no one could possibly have associated any hidden\r\ngrief with either of them, not even with Mrs. Lambert, and Viola met\r\nher hostess with the gay spirits of an unexpected but confident guest.\r\n\r\nKate was both amazed and delighted by their sudden irruption, and\r\nbeing eager to know all the details of their escape from the Pratt\r\nstronghold hurried Viola and her mother away to their rooms, leaving\r\nLambert in Morton's care.\r\n\r\n\"Well, professor,\" said the miner, when they were alone, \"we made the\r\nbreak and won out. I reckon they're side-tracked now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and I hope we are done with both Pratt and Clarke; but they'll\r\nboth bear watching. Pratt I especially fear.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's had his notice,\" Lambert grimly replied. \"As for Clarke, it\r\nlooks as though even Julia had got enough of him. He looked like a man\r\non the road to the mad-house, and I reckon she's convinced of it now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I pitied him, but I do not feel that you are in any sense indebted to\r\nhim. On the contrary, a large part of your daughter's slavery to the\r\ntrance is due to his pernicious influence.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must be something of an influence yourself, professor. It was\r\nwonderful the way you brought her out of that trance. I never saw that\r\ndone before. I reckon you must have some kind of mesmerism about you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a particle more than you have. However, I should like to believe\r\nin my power to help her. In fact, I do believe that. It is really a\r\nquestion of her own will. The old idea of some subtle physical force\r\nor fluid passing from the operator to the subject is no longer held.\r\nIt is not even necessary to make passes nor to put the subject in a\r\ntrance. All we need to do is suggest to her that no one, not even her\r\nghostly grandfather, can control her against her will. We must keep\r\nher mind full of bright and cheerful thoughts, and convince her that\r\nby leaving the Pratt house she has attained freedom.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will do what I can,\" said Lambert; \"but I've seen her taken down so\r\nmany times, I'm a little doubtful. She's in a bad way, I admit. It has\r\nits bad side as well as its pretty side, this religion. It unhinges a\r\nlot of people, and I reckon Clarke's a little off or he wouldn't have\r\ngot my folks into that mess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't let Viola feel your doubt; present a confident face to her.\r\nThere is nothing supernatural in the world, nothing lying outside of\r\nnature or outside of law. Many diseases which were once considered\r\ndemoniacal possessions we now know to be quite as natural as any other\r\nin fact. Disease is only health gone wrong; and the mental disorder in\r\nwhich Viola now stands is certainly curable if we proceed properly and\r\nwith confidence.\"\r\n\r\n\"I like to have you say these things, professor. They kind o' fit in\r\nwith what I've thought over all by myself out there in the mountains.\r\nI like the man who says 'such and such a thing is so-and-so, because I\r\ncan prove it.' That's what science is, I take it. There's altogether\r\ntoo much guess-work about this spiritualistic religion--it needs some\r\nengineer like you to get down to the bed-rock. Clarke is the kind of\r\nman who thinks he's on the vein when he ain't.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm giving it a good deal of thought, and may be I will some day take\r\nup the experimentation--but not with your daughter as a subject.\r\nHowever, we'll discuss that later. You are tired and I'll show you\r\nyour room and bath, and after you freshen up a bit we'll discuss our\r\nnext movement.\"\r\n\r\nLambert turned as he entered the room assigned to him, and said, with\r\ndeep feeling: \"I'm trusting in you, professor. I'm out o' my latitude\r\nin this spirit enterprise. As I say, I've neglected my family since\r\nClarke came into it, and it was all wrong. I should have asserted my\r\nrights. I don't blame Julia as much as I did. Women are kind o' weak\r\nin some ways--more religious, you may say--and Clarke got hold of\r\nJulia in a way that I couldn't understand. I didn't mind her thinking\r\nmore of Waldron than of me--that's natural, we all have our first\r\nloves--but I couldn't stand Clarke's overbearing ways in my own\r\nhouse.\" His voice grew firm. \"Well, now, here I am with time and\r\nmoney. Tell me what to do and I'll do it.\"\r\n\r\nMorton's liking for the Western man was raised almost to affection, as\r\nhe looked into his earnest, remorseful eyes and listened to his\r\nlow-toned confession. \"You may depend on my help,\" he responded,\r\nheartily, extending his hand in token. \"Your step-daughter interests\r\nme deeply. There is something for you to do, but I will not ask it\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, tell me, so I can be thinking it over.\"\r\n\r\nMorton pondered a moment, then said: \"I had a consultation to-day with\r\na great nerve specialist, a man who uses hypnotism, or 'suggestion,'\r\nas he calls it, in his practice. He is perfectly sure that your\r\ndaughter can be restored to mental health, but she must have a\r\ncomplete change of companionship and environment. He agrees with me\r\nthat she must be separated not merely from Pratt and Clarke, but from\r\nher mother also. I need your help in this.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will be hard on Julia,\" Lambert slowly responded. \"She hasn't\r\nmuch else but the girl and her religion.\" He looked down at the floor.\r\n\"Yes, that is a rough sentence, professor, but I shouldn't wonder if\r\nyou were right.\"\r\n\r\n\"It must be done, Lambert; and the very best service you can render is\r\nto take your wife and go home, leaving Viola here in our care--But\r\nthat can wait till after you are rested.\" And with this final word he\r\nclosed the door and returned to his library to await Kate's return and\r\nher inevitable demand for the story of what had taken place.\r\n\r\nHe took up one of the most recent books treating of Suggestion, and\r\nresumed consideration of a paragraph which had arrested him as if a\r\nhand had been placed upon his shoulder. \"Suggestion does not limit or\r\ndepress the subconscious self, it sets it free, exalts its powers,\r\nmaking it not something less, but something vastly more than the\r\nnormal and the conscious self.\"\r\n\r\nCould it be possible that Viola, in common with hundreds of other\r\napparently well-authenticated cases, possessed the \"psychic force\"\r\nwhich Maxwell, Richet, and Lombroso recognized? The hypothesis,\r\ndifficult as it was, profoundly inexplicable from every point of view,\r\nwas, after all, less of a wrench to the reason, came closer to the\r\nframe of his philosophy than the claims of Crookes and Wallace. To\r\naccept the spiritist faith even as a \"working hypothesis\" was\r\nimpossible to his definite type of mind.\r\n\r\nIf these raps, movements, voices, could be related to the working of\r\nthe subconscious mind, or, as Meyers called it, the \"subliminal self,\"\r\nthen the power of the hypnotist might be able to control their order\r\nand to a certain extent their character. They were not signs of a\r\ndiseased brain (according to Meyers again), but were the\r\nmanifestations of a power scattered here and there among men, without\r\nsystem, without known law. Maxwell agreeing with this, ends by saying:\r\n\"These mysterious phenomena are due, therefore, neither to spirits nor\r\ndisease, but to a perfectly natural force lying within the minds of\r\nthe sitters and exercised by the psychic.\"\r\n\r\nHe had already derived much hope from the monumental work of Meyers\r\nand his school. Hundreds of cases of hallucinations, alternating\r\npersonality, hysterio-epilepsy, and other kindred apparent\r\nabnormalities, had been studied by means of hypnotism, and certain\r\nprocesses inhibited or set going at the will of an operator. The\r\nlatest word of these masters was most heartening. They had\r\ndemonstrated that the trance was no longer a necessary part of\r\nhypnotism. That the subject would not follow out in trance any\r\nimproper or criminal suggestion which he would not do in conscious\r\nstate; and, \"There is no great physical difference between the normal\r\nand the hypnotic state,\" he read; \"the real mental difference lies in\r\nthe temporary removal of motives tending to counteract the suggestion,\r\nand this removal does not imply an inhibition of faculty, but an\r\nactual extension or liberation of faculty.\"\r\n\r\nIn fine, these men agreed that the mind, reaching back, by its very\r\nstructure, to the beginning of organic life, was limited by\r\nconsciousness to a comparatively small number of its potentialities,\r\nwhereas its subliminal life (on the contrary) was infinite and\r\nunsearchably subtle. All minds partook, in varying degrees, of these\r\nbaffling powers, but only now and then, through unusual favoring\r\ncircumstances, was the brain able to manifest its depth and subtlety.\r\nSickness, sleeplessness, physical shock, some accidental series of\r\nevents now and then permitted a display of these hidden acquirements,\r\nand thereafter the individual was marked as abnormal, possessed,\r\naccording to the ancient view, by angels or devils.\r\n\r\nOthers still, by putting themselves deliberately into the study, had\r\nbeen able to subordinate the conscious mind, little by little\r\nliberating their subliminal forces by practice, attaining thus almost\r\nmiraculous powers. In this way the \"medium\" became clairvoyant,\r\nclairaudient, telekinetic. In other cases still, as in Viola's case,\r\nthis subordination of the supra-liminal self had been accomplished by\r\nthe suggestion of others, by submission to the will of others.\r\n\r\nHe had been profoundly instructed by Tolman's account of a case of\r\nalternating personality which he had studied with so much care. The\r\nfact that the secondary self appeared when the subject's life seemed\r\nat a lower ebb, and when the cerebral centres were sparsely supplied\r\nwith the life-current, and the further fact that the use of a certain\r\nsubstance which stimulated (without poisoning) the higher\r\nbrain-centres, was able to bring back the primary or supra-liminal\r\nself, was of the utmost value. It threw a flood of light upon Viola's\r\ncondition, for had she not in her trance become inert, cold, and\r\nalmost without pulse? He had provided himself with this drug, and as\r\nhe studied its appearance in the phial, so minute, so colorless, so\r\nhelpless in its prison, he felt once again the mystery of matter, and\r\nsmiled to think how childish was the popular conception of the\r\nphysical universe as something dead and inorganic. Nothing is more\r\nmysterious.\r\n\r\n\"The office of this drug can be twofold. It has the power in itself to\r\nflush the cerebral centres with fresh blood, and it can also serve as\r\na point of support for the suggestion I am about to give. It does not\r\nreally matter whether she has any phase of what they call mediumistic\r\npower or not. To rid her of her trances will liberate her from a\r\nbelief in her ills, and that is the main consideration.\"\r\n\r\nHe found the greatest encouragement at this point in the many cases\r\nwhere perfect mental health had been restored by means of a complete\r\nchange of mental stimuli. \"All hypnotic methods,\" he read, \"have one\r\nthing in common, and that is the diversion of attention from the\r\ninsistency of external surroundings.... The hypnotic state has one\r\nbroad characteristic, and that is the working of the subliminal\r\nconsciousness in directions unusual in ordinary life.\"\r\n\r\n\"The way to help her is to cut off every suggestion which leads to the\r\ntrance and to the thought of the dead; to centre her mind on the\r\nserene, the busy, the sunny. Thus flooding her brain with sights and\r\nsounds utterly disassociated with her past.\"\r\n\r\nThe realization that she was at last domesticated under his roof made\r\nher redemption seem easy, certain, almost accomplished. There remained\r\nonly the painful duty of separating her from her mother. He could see\r\nthat this would bring keen sorrow upon them both, but that if she\r\ncould be brought to consider him in the light of her future husband,\r\nthe change would seem less violent; for, after all, it was the law of\r\nlife which subordinated the claims of the mother to those of the\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n\"At any rate, the issue is now clear in my mind. A powerful chain of\r\nsuggestion has been formed and fastened upon her by her own mother and\r\nby Clarke. That chain must be broken; it is broken in Clarke's case,\r\nand no matter what the pain, the fear, this course may cause the\r\nmother, it must be pursued in order to restore Viola to health.\"\r\n\r\nHe passed from this to a forecast of the radical changes in his own\r\nlife which an avowal of love would make, and his mood chilled. He had\r\nalways imagined the announcement of his engagement, falling into a\r\nsober and decorous paragraph among the society notes, and had figured\r\nhimself receiving with dignified composure the congratulations of his\r\nassociates and club-fellows. He had never considered the possibility\r\nof shrinking from these publicities, nor fancied himself in the light\r\nof finding excuses to justify or explain his marriage. He now clearly\r\nforesaw, foreheard the comment, the surprise, the opposition of his\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nHe pulled himself up short with a word of derision at the length to\r\nwhich he had permitted his mind to run. \"All this for the future. The\r\nimmediate question is, Can she be freed from her bonds?\"\r\n\r\nHe was deep in his book when Kate entered with excited greeting.\r\n\"Morton, do you know that those women have been locked in their rooms\r\nall day for fear of Clarke and Pratt? Well, they were! Clarke has gone\r\nstark mad with jealousy, and even that besotted mother was afraid of\r\nhim, and admits it. They would be there in that house prisoners this\r\nminute only for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't lay your wreath on my head; keep it for Lambert. Really, Kate,\r\nhe was magnificent. Little as he is, he towered. I had no doubt of his\r\nwillingness and ability to kill either Pratt or Clarke; and I don't\r\nthink they questioned the integrity of his promise.\"\r\n\r\nKate's mind took a new turn. \"She's broken with Clarke, thank Heaven!\r\nBut the mother clings to him in spite of all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am about to suggest to Mrs. Lambert that she go West with her\r\nhusband, leaving the girl in your care for a little while.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish they would!\"\r\n\r\n\"She must be freed from even her mother's presence for a while--that\r\nis, if they really want to have her cured of her trances.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" said Kate, thoughtfully. \"The mother is so closely associated\r\nwith all that tapping.\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely. I wish, when Mrs. Lambert is rested, you would ask her to\r\nlet me see her here. I want to talk these matters over with her in\r\nprivate.\"\r\n\r\n\"They're both lying down, but I'll tell her when she rises. Don't do\r\nanything rash,\" she added, with a reaction towards caution which\r\namused him.\r\n\r\n\"You may trust me.\"\r\n\r\nShe came back a few steps, and hesitatingly said. \"For, after all,\r\nMorton, the girl _is_ abnormal.\"\r\n\r\n\"So are we all--under abnormal conditions. I am going to see if I\r\ncan't so change the current of her thought that she will forget her\r\nbesetments--and you must help me.\"\r\n\r\n\"She's shockingly pretty and it will be very dangerous having her\r\nbeneath your very roof.\" She gave a warning backward look. \"How dare\r\nyou permit it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am a very brave man,\" he replied, with a smile, and an inflection\r\nthat puzzled her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\nTHE MOTHER'S FAITH\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Lambert entered timidly, her gentle face sadder and its lip-line\r\nfirmer than he had ever seen it. It was evident that the experiences\r\nof the last few days had touched her and shaken her.\r\n\r\nUp to this time Morton had considered her as a genial but rather\r\nnegative personality, a soul naturally subordinate to others, but she\r\nnow rose to an importance in his life which made her real self of the\r\nhighest significance. His first glance was one of sincerest\r\nadmiration. Doubtless she had once been as slender and quite as tall\r\nas her daughter, and though increasing age and weight had combined to\r\nrob her of height and grace, she was, nevertheless, still a distinctly\r\ncommanding figure. Her head was nobly fashioned, her eyes a candid\r\nblue, and her glance clear and unworn in its appeal.\r\n\r\nAltogether he could not but acknowledge in her a mother of which no\r\nman need be ashamed, and in this spirit he met her and invited her to\r\na seat. \"Mr. Lambert and I have been talking of the mountains to-day,\"\r\nhe began. \"I wish we were on our way out there this moment, for I am\r\ntired of the city.\"\r\n\r\nShe brightened under his smile. \"I wouldn't mind going home at once,\r\nbut I know Viola would be disappointed. She has seen so little of the\r\ncity, and then Mr. Clarke--\" She broke off in some confusion as if in\r\nsudden recollection of the chasm which had opened between the young\r\nclergyman and her daughter.\r\n\r\nHe seized upon this allusion to say: \"I did not think of including Mr.\r\nClarke, Mrs. Lambert. I think you and your daughter have both had too\r\nmuch of him. I do not doubt his sincerity, but I am quite certain that\r\nhe was leading you both into an abyss. I hope you will make the most\r\nof this chance to free yourself from his influence. I quite stand with\r\nyour husband in that resolution.\"\r\n\r\nHer face grew cold again. \"As to that, I must wait for further\r\nillumination. These last few hours have been so disturbed we are quite\r\ncut off from our guides.\"\r\n\r\n\"You depend upon them--they are very real to you, are they not?\" He\r\nspoke musingly.\r\n\r\n\"They are just as real to me as you are--or any one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you not doubt their wisdom to-day?\"\r\n\r\nShe drew herself up. \"Why should I?\"\r\n\r\n\"They knew nothing of your husband's coming?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, they did, only they couldn't communicate on account of\r\nViola's mental condition.\" Then, with unshakable conviction, she\r\nadded: \"If I doubted them I should doubt everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry to trouble you. I am not one to needlessly destroy a\r\ncomforting faith, and yet I confess I thought the time had come to\r\ninvoke your husband's aid. It was in that spirit I sent the telegram.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am very glad you did, although I had no fear. I knew my father\r\nwould find the right way when the time came. Let me tell you, sir,\"\r\nshe replied, expanding in the warmth of his interest. \"Before these\r\nrevelations came to me I had no real faith in God or heaven. The world\r\nbeyond the grave was dark and cold. It seemed to me as if my little\r\nboy and my husband were in the cruel, wet ground. I couldn't feel that\r\nthey had gone to Christ. But now the tomb is but a portal to the\r\nlight. The spirit-plane is as real as the earth-plane, and filled with\r\njoyous souls. I can hear them sing sometimes when I hold Viola's hand,\r\nand the sound is very beautiful and very comforting.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can understand that,\" he answered, but quietly, critically, still\r\nstudying her face. \"It has a warmer charm than any other religion I\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\nShe went on, eagerly: \"I wish you could come to believe. Your sister\r\nsaid your mother and your uncle spoke last night. Why can't you accept\r\nthe faith?\"\r\n\r\nThe young philosopher gained, as she spoke, a new conception of her\r\ncharacter, and chilled with a growing sense of the difficult and\r\nungracious task which lay before him. He began to perceive that her\r\nawe of him had kept her silent, thus concealing from him the spirit of\r\nthe evangelist which he now saw she possessed. She counted more\r\nlargely in Viola's development than he had hitherto granted. Her\r\nfaith was solidly based on years of experience and was not to be\r\neasily moved. As she went on he perceived that her daughter's\r\nmediumship was much more than a theory in her thought; it was a fact,\r\nand a daily, almost an hourly, necessity. He lost his last suspicion\r\nof her, and caught a glimpse of the larger aspect of her relationship\r\nto his future. She was deceived, of course, but she was honest in\r\nevery fibre. He could not accuse her of the slightest deceit or\r\nfalsification.\r\n\r\nIn her lame way she tried to argue the question, quoting the\r\nplatitudes of the \"inspirational speakers,\" as well as the pompous\r\nphrases of her spirit-father, while he listened courteously.\r\n\r\nWhen she paused, he said, gravely: \"My dear Mrs. Lambert, I can't\r\nleave you in any doubt of my position. I cannot for a single instant\r\naccept what happened last night as the manifestation of the\r\ndisembodied. I cannot think that the phenomena exist. I must rather\r\nthink they were performed by Clarke, or my sister, or Weissmann, in\r\njoke.\" She looked at him with an expression of horror, of incredulity,\r\nand he went on, quickly: \"Even if I admitted the fact of direct\r\nwriting or the movement of the horn, I should not by any means be\r\ndriven to accept your spirit-hypothesis. There are men, and very great\r\ninvestigators, who would say that your daughter's trances and all\r\nphenomena connected therewith were pathologic, explainable on the\r\ngrounds of some obscure neural derangement. I do not say this is the\r\ncase, but I do say that if she persists in these practices she will\r\nlose control of her mental faculties. I have had a consultation to-day\r\nwith Dr. Tolman, a man who makes a specialty of such cases, and when I\r\nhad laid the whole matter before him, he and Dr. Weissmann both\r\nadvised the immediate stopping of these trances.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can't do that. They come from the other side. My father induces\r\nthe trance, and it is entirely in his hands.\"\r\n\r\nHe fixed a keen look upon her. \"Did it ever occur to you that the\r\nwords of your 'guides' were, in reality, but a reflex of the wishes of\r\nPratt or Clarke?\"\r\n\r\n\"How could that be when they came to me long before I even knew\r\nAnthony?\"\r\n\r\n\"But was not the advice of a different quality at that time? Maybe\r\nyour father yields to the will of living people when they are strong\r\nenough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, quite the contrary. He opposes Mr. Clarke often. Sometimes he\r\nopposes us all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am perfectly sure that the voices that spoke to us last night were\r\na subtle delusion, an emanation from our own bodies--or the work of a\r\njoker. My reason repels them as spirits.\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled a little. \"I think you scientific people go a long way\r\nround to explain a very simple thing. I've read some of the\r\nexplanations of the way in which you think these phenomena come, but\r\nthey are harder to understand than the thing itself. My father, my\r\nhusband, and my little son are alive. I know that. No one can destroy\r\nthat faith in me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not wish to destroy that faith--only so far as it seems to\r\nthreaten your daughter.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am perfectly sure they know better what we should do than any one\r\non the earth-plane. I cannot see why you people oppose the idea of the\r\nspirit-world when it is so beautiful and could fill the world with\r\nhope. The Bible teaches it when you read it right. It is full of\r\nreferences to spirits. Did not Christ rise from the dead and manifest\r\nto His disciples?\"\r\n\r\n\"And did He not cast out devils?\"\r\n\r\nShe was momentarily at a loss, but soon recovered. \"But if you admit\r\nthere are _evil_ spirits--\"\r\n\r\n\"But I don't. I said that merely to show you that a sceptic can quote\r\nScripture to his purpose. There is no place in my philosophy for the\r\nsupernatural.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is what we believe,\" she eagerly responded. \"I used to be\r\nfrightened by the things that happened to Viola, but now I know they\r\nare natural, just as natural as anything else. My loved ones are not\r\nfar away, they are very near, but, oh, so intangible. If I could only\r\ntouch them!\" In this was the cry of her soul. She deeply sighed. \"I am\r\ngrowing old, and that means I live in the past more and more. When\r\nWaltie comes I can imagine myself as I was when we first went to the\r\nmountains. Robert means more and more to me, and all fear of 'the\r\nchange' is gone. Really, if it were not for Viola I would like to go\r\nover to the other side to-night. The spirit-plane seems so much more\r\ncare-free and bright. This life is but a preparatory school at best.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is all wrong,\" he decisively replied. \"Very wrong. Even if your\r\nidea of the other world were right, you should not abandon your hold\r\non this till your work was done. A general condition of mind like\r\nyours would stop all invention, all discovery, and especially all\r\nphilanthropy. In fact, the only philanthropy would be murder. To end\r\nman's suffering here would be a duty. War would be a blessing, and\r\ndisease a rescue. No, no. You must not talk like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm not really thinking of going. I feel that I must stay a\r\nlittle while longer to see Viola settled in life.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by that? Do you mean married, and happy, or do you\r\nmean given over entirely to the trance?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose she ought to marry--she is very unhappy as she is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, that is what I especially wanted to talk with you about. I have\r\ndecided to ask your daughter to put herself into my hands, and I hope\r\nyou will give your consent.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be glad to have you take charge of her, professor, and\r\nfather, I know, is anxious to have you head the committee.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't mean that! I mean something much more intimate, much more\r\nimportant.\" This brought him face to face with himself and the\r\ndecision over which he had agonized for so long, and for an instant he\r\nhesitated, then took the plunge bravely. \"I love your daughter, Mrs.\r\nLambert, and I want your permission to tell her so.\"\r\n\r\nShe drew back into her chair with a gasp of surprise and a look of\r\nalarm.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I didn't understand! I thought you meant--I don't know--I--\" She\r\nwas utterly at a loss for words, but he understood her.\r\n\r\n\"Your hesitation is not flattering to me. I hope you don't absolutely\r\ndistrust me.\"\r\n\r\nHer embarrassment was pitiful. \"Oh no, indeed! But you are a sceptic.\r\nYou don't believe in us--in her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, I do!\"\r\n\r\n\"And, besides, she has been promised for two years to Tony--Mr.\r\nClarke.\"\r\n\r\nHe grew a little hard at mention of the preacher's name. \"But she\r\nfears and hates Clarke. She has broken with him. She told my sister\r\nthat she was done with him forever. You will not ask her to marry a\r\nman she distrusts?\"\r\n\r\nShe flew to Clarke's defence. \"That was only a mood, a lover's\r\nquarrel. He was all upset by Pratt and--and other things. I will not\r\nallow her to desert him when he is in trouble. He has been so much to\r\nus, and he is a noble character in spite of all.\"\r\n\r\n\"All this is very disturbing to me,\" he answered, more humorously than\r\nhe felt. \"But, nevertheless, I also claim to be a noble character.\"\r\n\r\nShe began once more to realize his place in the world and his kindness\r\nto Viola. \"I know that, professor, I fully recognize the honor you do\r\nher and me, but she is not like other girls. She is set aside to do\r\nGod's work, and ought not to marry at all. That is why the 'guides'\r\nhave given her to Anthony; he, too, is consecrated.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear Mrs. Lambert, you shock me when you say such things. I don't\r\nbelieve it is your daughter's duty to convert people to a belief in\r\nimmortality. I don't believe in teaching men and women to depend upon\r\nan unseen world for guidance; and especially do I despise any faith\r\nwhich makes this life less important than some other just beyond. I\r\nlove this life, and do not intend to trouble myself about what lies\r\nbeyond the grave. That is really not my concern. To regard this world\r\nas a vale of tears leading to a shining heaven is a species of\r\nmediævalism from which I revolt.\"\r\n\r\nShe caught this up. \"That is just the reason why Viola would be\r\nunhappy with a sceptic.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I am not a sceptic. I have the greatest faith. I am certain I can\r\nmake her happy here and now. You surely would not permit her to go\r\nback to Anthony Clarke!\"\r\n\r\nShe was troubled and confused. \"I don't know. Perhaps it would be\r\nbest, after all. A great deal of her 'power' comes from him.\" She\r\nbrightened. \"But I will leave all that to father.\"\r\n\r\nAgain he leaned to her with tender gravity. \"You must not do that.\r\nUnless you deny the value of all life here on the earth, you are an\r\nunnatural mother to devote your child to such a career as Clarke\r\nholds out to her. I love your daughter because she is a beautiful\r\ngirl, a charming personality, and I am able to give her security and\r\ncomfort. I will be perfectly frank with you. I think these trances\r\nhave been fastened upon her by those about her, and if she consents to\r\ncome to me I shall stop them forever. My aim will be to delude her\r\ninto thinking life with me of more value than the highest eminence as\r\na 'medium.' Now, if this seems treason to you, I cannot soften it. I\r\nwant you to fully understand my position. My schooling has been all in\r\nthe exact sciences, and what skill I possess I am using to make the\r\nworld a healthier and happier place to live in. Your way of life (and\r\nClarke's philosophy of life) seems to me weak and morbid, and your\r\ntreatment of your daughter mistakenly cruel. I intend to take her out\r\nof it, if I can. And, furthermore, dear lady, if you withhold your\r\nconsent, which I profoundly hope you will not, I must proceed without\r\nit. If she comes to me, she ceases to be a psychic. If I can prevent\r\nit, she will never sit again.\"\r\n\r\nThe mother sat as if stunned by the weight of his will, the rush of\r\nhis words, the decision of his glance. She fully understood the\r\nsituation. She knew that Viola already leaned upon and trusted this\r\nman more than any other being in the world, and knowing this she felt\r\nthe full force of the tragic situation. It was not a question of a\r\ntemporary separation, that she foresaw as by some prophetic vision.\r\nHer baby, her clinging, loving girl-child was about to pass from her\r\narms forever, carrying with her all interest in life and all means of\r\ncommunication with her dead. With her she was about to lose husband,\r\nson--and all the blessed music of the happy multitudes of those on the\r\nspirit-plane. It was as if the shining portals to the world of light\r\nwere about to be closed to her forever, closed and barred by the hand\r\nof this implacable young lover, and with a sudden, most lamentable cry\r\nshe sobbed forth: \"Oh, I can't consent! I can't bear to think of it!\"\r\n\r\nThe sight of that placid, motherly face breaking into lines of anguish\r\nwhile the gray old head bowed in weakness, completely unmanned the\r\nself-centred young scientist, and bending above her, he tenderly\r\npleaded.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Mrs. Lambert, you wring my heart with your weeping. Don't cry, I\r\nbeg of you! I didn't intend to be harsh. I only intended to be honest\r\nwith you. I wish you would trust me. Let me be a son to you. Even if\r\nViola does not care for me as I hope she does, I can help you, and\r\neven if she consents to my treatment, the separation will only be for\r\na few months or a year.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would take my hope from me. You would rob me!\" She challenged him\r\nwith white and distorted face. \"You are hard and cruel, and I will not\r\ngive her up. I know her nature. She is necessary to the spirit-world\r\nand you have no right to destroy her power.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry if I seemed to attack your faith. It has many beautiful\r\nthings inwoven with its morbidities. I would believe it if I could,\r\nbut I can't, and in my present state of mind I can only repeat that,\r\nhowever painful it may be to you, I see no other way to save your\r\ndaughter from insanity. Yes, my dear Mrs. Lambert, the case is quite\r\nas desperate as that, to my thinking, and as I am beginning to centre\r\nmy life in her also, you will see that I am quite as deeply concerned\r\nas any one. She has reached a danger-point. She must not go on in this\r\nway another month.\"\r\n\r\nAgain those lines of serene obstinacy came back into her face, and the\r\ngentle bigot looked from her eyes. \"You are all wrong. These trances\r\nare as natural as sleep. They rest her, do her good--father says so.\r\nHe treats her from that side and is watching over her. I admire you,\r\nProfessor Serviss, I appreciate the honor you do me, but I cannot\r\nconsent to have Viola go from me. I can't endure the thought. If you\r\nbelieved in the spirit-world and the guides consented, I would be\r\nglad; but you don't. You hate everything concerning our faith, and I\r\nam afraid of you. I wish my girl had never seen you.\" She rose in a\r\npanic of growing alarm. \"Let me go to her!\"\r\n\r\nHe detained her gently. \"Just a moment. Remember I have not said a\r\nword of all this to her, and your alarm may be quite groundless. What\r\ndo you fear if your 'guides' are so wise and powerful? Where is your\r\nproselyting zeal? Am I not worthy of being converted? Why not let\r\nViola influence me towards your path?\"\r\n\r\nShe sank back into her chair bewildered by his tone, and he went on:\r\n\"You considered Mr. Clarke a most important instrument for spreading\r\nthe light, but I am egotistic enough to say that my conversion would\r\nmean more to your cause than fifty Clarkes. You forget also that your\r\nfather was very anxious to have me brought into the circle. You recall\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\nShe faintly answered, \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, let that count in my favor. You call me a sceptic, but I\r\nam really a slave to evidence. I will go wherever the evidence leads.\r\nI have no proof of the spirit-world, but I am of open mind. Can you\r\nask any more of me than that? I have said that I intend to end Viola's\r\ncareer as a psychic, if I can; but if I can't, if the manifestations\r\ngo on in spite of me, I will study them faithfully, glad of any\r\nrevelation of a new world which they may bring. If you are so clear in\r\nyour confidence, so certain of your faith, why not consent to let me\r\nspeak to her?\"\r\n\r\nShe rose again. \"I can't do that. I _must_ not.\"\r\n\r\nHe offered his hand with a smile. \"Your lack of confidence in me I\r\nforgive, for I think I understand your feeling. Do not be deceived, my\r\nsuit does not end here. I intend, at the earliest moment, to win your\r\ndaughter's consent to my plan. There is only one thing I would like\r\nyou to promise, and that is this: Don't prejudice her against me. Let\r\nme speak to her first. Will you promise that?\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. \"I must tell her, and we must sit for council.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, will you promise to let me sit with you? Will you promise\r\nto put off that sitting till I can be present? It is only fair to me,\r\nas I am quite as vitally affected as any one in the result. Come! Will\r\nyou promise?\"\r\n\r\nShe bowed her head in sign of consent and hastened towards the door.\r\n\r\nHe stood aside to let her pass, pitying her because understanding her.\r\n\"And please don't distress her to-night. Let her live this evening as\r\na joyous girl, undisturbed even by my question.\"\r\n\r\nShe went out fear-stricken by the power of his glance, the persuasion\r\nof his voice. Her instinct at the moment was to take her child and\r\nflee, immuring herself far from those who would rob her of her only\r\nremaining interest in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nCLARKE SHADOWS THE FEAST\r\n\r\n\r\nViola, looking up from a piece of antique jewelry which Kate was\r\ndisplaying, was startled by the sadness of her mother's face, and\r\ndirected her next glance upon Morton, in the wish to discover the\r\ncause of her trouble. That the interview had been very grave and\r\npersonal was evident, and with a sense of having been the subject of\r\ndiscussion, she rose to meet them.\r\n\r\nKate did not permit any explanations, for dinner was waiting and time\r\nlimited. \"Go fetch Mr. Lambert, Morton: unless we want to be late at\r\nthe play we must go out at once.\"\r\n\r\nMorton was glad of the interruption, for he was eager to have his\r\nunderstanding with Viola before the mother could bring any adverse\r\ninfluence to bear upon her. As they went out into the dining-room,\r\nside by side, he found her nearness sweeter and more concerning than\r\never before; and with a realization of having in a very vital way\r\nstaked his immediate future upon her word, he was unusually gay,\r\nmasking his persistent, deep-hid doubt in jocose remarks. Lambert\r\nseconded him with quiet humor, and together they caused even the\r\nmother's face to relax its troubled lines, while Viola, yielding to a\r\nsense of freedom and of youth, shook off all constraint, responding to\r\nMorton's unspoken suggestion, thinking only of him and of the secure,\r\nbright world in which he dwelt (and in which he seemed so large and so\r\nhandsome a figure), and in this confidence and comfort they came to\r\nthe mixing of the salad, which Kate slangily explained to be Morton's\r\n\"particular stunt.\" He had fully assembled his ingredients, and was\r\nabout to approach the actual, delicate blending when the maid appeared\r\nat his elbow to say that he was wanted at the telephone.\r\n\r\n\"Well, tell them to wait,\" he replied, testily. \"This is a very\r\nprecise moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"I told them you were at dinner, sir, but they said it was important.\"\r\n\r\nHe rose with a sigh. \"I hope my 'whiff of garlic' won't settle into a\r\nsteady breeze. Be patient a moment, kind people.\"\r\n\r\nWith mild wonder as to what the news might be, he took a seat at his\r\ndesk and put the receiver to his ear.\r\n\r\n\"Hello. Who is it?\"\r\n\r\nA hurried, eager, almost breathless boyish voice responded. \"Is this\r\nDr. Serviss?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you tell me where Miss Viola Lambert and her mother are?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot.\" By which he meant he was not empowered to do so.\r\n\r\n\"I was told they left Pratt's house with you sometime this afternoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you inquired at the Courtleigh?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I was so sure--\"\r\n\r\n\"Try either the Courtleigh or the Colorado,\" replied Morton, in the\r\ntone of authority.\r\n\r\nThe voice then asked: \"Can you tell me where Clarke's Brooklyn\r\nrelatives can be found?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot. I know nothing whatever of Mr. Clarke's family.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must find them. Clarke has committed suicide, and it is necessary\r\nto notify his friends and--\"\r\n\r\nMorton's brain blurred with the force of this blow, \"You don't mean\r\nit! When did it happen?\"\r\n\r\n\"About an hour ago. We must find the Lamberts, and if you can give us\r\nany information--\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm a representative of _The Recorder_. Can I see you for a few\r\nminutes, Dr. Serviss?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am just starting for the theatre,\" hurriedly answered Morton, his\r\nvoice as casual as he could make it; \"and I fear it is impossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very important, Dr. Serviss, for Pratt has told me that you\r\nknow the Lamberts and all about their relationship to Clarke. If\r\nyou--\"\r\n\r\n\"It is quite impossible,\" replied Morton, with decision, and hung up\r\nthe receiver. For a few moments he sat in deep thought, his mind\r\nleaping from point to point of this new complication. As he analyzed\r\nthe far-reaching consequences of this tragic and terrible deed he\r\nbitterly exclaimed: \"You've reached us now, Anthony Clarke! You have\r\ninvolved the woman you pretended to love and all her friends in a\r\nscreaming sensation. Your name will be writ larger to-morrow than at\r\nany time during your whole life. You could not have hit upon a more\r\neffective revenge.\"\r\n\r\nThe situation grew each moment more satanic. \"My name will be involved\r\nquite as prominently as hers. The mother, frantic with grief and\r\nremorse, will hate me and bitterly reproach us all. She will accuse us\r\nof causing his death. But, most important of all, what will be the\r\neffect of this news on Viola's mental condition?\" His thought ran to\r\nher as he had just left her radiant with hope and new-found happiness,\r\nand it seemed as though the dead man had reached a remorseless,\r\nclutching hand to regain final dominion over her. His shadow hovered\r\nin the air above her head ready to envelop her.\r\n\r\n\"If I can only keep this from her for a few days, till my own control\r\nof her has strengthened. I _must_ keep it from her. She must not see\r\nto-morrow's papers with their ghastly story.\" He chilled with a fuller\r\nsense of the suicide's power to torture her. \"She must leave the city\r\nto-night. She will be called before the coroner, her mediumship and\r\nClarke's control of her will be howled through the street--\" He\r\ngroaned with the shame and anguish of the scene his imagination bodied\r\nforth. \"Pratt's hand will also be felt. He will have his own tale, his\r\nown method of evasion, and will not hesitate to dishonor her.\"\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this threatening shame so far from arousing a new\r\ndistrust and a desire to escape further connection with her, swept him\r\ninto a profounder desire to serve and shield her. His heart filled\r\nwith pity and love, and into his eyes a stern light--the light of\r\nbattle--came. \"She shall not be tortured so, if I can defend her or\r\nlead the way to escape. Lambert must leave the city at once and take\r\nthem both with him.\"\r\n\r\nHe rose and walked about the room in order to recover command of his\r\nface and voice. \"Truly the miserable fanatic has wrought well. He has\r\npromised himself that his spirit, freed from the body, will be able to\r\npossess and control his victim. The mother will understand and accept\r\nthis. Will Viola?\" The thought of her, dominated by this new and\r\nrevolting delusion, filled him with dismay and horror. \"She, too, will\r\nbe smitten with remorse, and the scale may be turned against me and my\r\ninfluence.\" This was indeed the most disturbing consideration of all.\r\n\r\nRealizing at length that every additional minute of absence made his\r\nexplanation more difficult, he returned to his guests with impassive\r\nface and resolute determination to control his thought even from\r\nViola's mind-reading power.\r\n\r\nKate saw at once that some dark thing shadowed him, \"What is it,\r\nMorton?\"\r\n\r\n\"One of my acquaintances has met with trouble--financial trouble--and\r\nwants my help. I'll tell you about it later,\" he curtly replied,\r\nattacking the salad again. She was silenced though not satisfied, and\r\ndinner was resumed in almost painful silence and in general\r\ndepression.\r\n\r\nViola was especially troubled by the change in Morton's face, and with\r\na desire to be of some comfort to him softly said: \"Perhaps you would\r\nrather not go to the theatre to-night. Please don't do so on our\r\naccount.\"\r\n\r\nHer glance and her tone, both more intimately sympathetic than she had\r\nhitherto permitted them to be, touched him deeply, and with an effect\r\nof throwing off his gloom he cheerily responded: \"We will not let any\r\noutside matter interfere with our happiness. There is nothing to be\r\ngained by staying at home. Please forget all about this interruption.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke she sat with hands before her, gazing straight at him with\r\neyes that slowly lost their outward look. Her eyelids fell, she began\r\nto whiten and to droop, and her hands twitched and trembled.\r\n\r\nSeized for an instant with an unreasoning fear--a belief that she had\r\nbeen able, after all, to penetrate his mind and read its dreadful\r\nsecret, Morton sat irresolute, in the grasp of a blind despair, a\r\npalsy of the will. Clarke's dead hand seemed at the instant more\r\npowerful than the living man had been. This stupefaction lasted but a\r\nsingle second, for back to the young scientist's heart, like a\r\nswelling wave, came the red blood of his anger, his love, his\r\nmastering will. Rising swiftly but calmly, he caught her hands in his\r\nsaying, gently: \"You are forgetting your promise to me. Look at me. I\r\nwant to see if you are really going to disobey my commands.\"\r\n\r\nShe slowly raised her face to him, but only faintly responded to his\r\nvoice. \"I cannot permit this,\" he went on. \"You have left this behind\r\nyou, I will not permit you to give way. It is a kind of treason to\r\nme--your physician. For my sake you must put this weakness aside and\r\nassert your real self.\" He spoke gently, tenderly, as the lover,\r\nrather than as the man of science, and the mysterious power of his\r\nhand, the passionate pity of his eyes restored her to self-mastery,\r\nand she murmured:\r\n\r\n\"Please forgive me. I didn't mean to do this.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that. But you must not invite your trouble. You laid your\r\nhands upon the table. You must not do that. I'll order you to eat off\r\nthe mantel-piece, if you do that again,\" he added, with intent to make\r\nher smile.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lambert, who had risen to go to Viola's relief, sank back into\r\nher seat with a sense of being forgotten at a time when she should\r\nhave been her daughter's first thought. She was no longer necessary.\r\nHer place had been taken by another, a man and a stranger, hostile to\r\nher faith, and with this knowledge her heart grew cold and bitter with\r\ndefeat and despair, the anguish and the neglect which are to be\r\nforevermore the darker side of the mother's glory had come to her at\r\nlast with cruel force.\r\n\r\nThe entire attack lasted but a few minutes, but it served to bring\r\nViola nearer to her lover than all the hours of their more formal\r\nintercourse, though the full revelation of his true relationship was\r\nyet to come.\r\n\r\nShe loved and trusted him, but as her friend, her defender. She rose\r\nat last to demonstrate that she was entirely herself again. \"I am\r\nashamed of myself,\" she said, humbly. \"Please don't look so\r\nconcerned.\" She turned to Kate. \"I assure you it was only a little\r\nfaintness. You see I didn't sleep very well last night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's not try to go out,\" interposed Kate. \"You're tired.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no; please, _please_ don't let me spoil the evening. I will never\r\nforgive myself. Truly I want to go.\"\r\n\r\nMorton's glance instructed Kate, and she said: \"Very well. We will go\r\ndress while the men finish their coffee. Come, Mrs. Lambert.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lambert rose silently and the three women left the room together\r\nwith an effect of haste.\r\n\r\nNo sooner were they out of the room than Morton turned to his guest\r\nwith most serious look and tone. \"Come to my study, Mr. Lambert, I\r\nwant a few very private words with you.\"\r\n\r\nThe miner followed his host with mild wonder expressed on his face,\r\nand as the door closed behind them and they were secure of being\r\noverheard, he remarked, with a chuckle: \"You headed off old Daddy\r\nMcLeod out there. First it was Clarke and then Daddy. I thought he had\r\nher this time.\"\r\n\r\nMorton ignored this remark and, with most decisive utterance, said:\r\n\"You must take your wife and daughter out of town by the very next\r\ntrain. Clarke has killed himself, and Viola will be the centre of a\r\nflaming sensation to-morrow morning. She must be taken away to-night.\"\r\n\r\nLambert remained standing, perfectly rigid, for a few moments then\r\nslowly seated himself. \"Was that your trouble over the 'phone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who told you?\"\r\n\r\n\"A reporter 'phoning from Pratt's house apparently.\"\r\n\r\n\"When did it happen?\"\r\n\r\n\"He said an hour ago. That may mean more or less--A fiend could not\r\nhave planned a more inclusive revenge. We will all be involved in it.\r\nIf he died by poison we may even be accused of killing him. They are\r\nalready in pursuit of you, and the police may arrive at any moment. At\r\nthe least we will all be summoned before the coroner.\" He paused a\r\nmoment. \"But that isn't all. I fear the effect of this news on Viola's\r\nmind.\"\r\n\r\nLambert's eyes lost their keen glitter, and his facial muscles fell\r\nslack. He spoke in a low voice weighted with deepest conviction. \"_He\r\nwill manifest._\" Then, as a light came into his eyes, he exclaimed:\r\n\"He was trying to control her just now!\"\r\n\r\nMorton ignored this remark. \"If we can keep this news from her for a\r\nfew days, I defy any of her so-called 'controls' to affect her.\"\r\n\r\nLambert stirred uneasily in his chair. \"I don't know about that.\r\nClarke had a strong hold on her.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is dead. He has done his worst,\" responded Morton. \"I tell you,\r\nit is your business to get as far from the city to-night as you can\r\nand keep ahead of the news if possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"That won't do any good. She is clairvoyant. She'll know of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"She didn't know you were coming to-day, did she?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"And she has no knowledge yet of Clarke's death. Her attack at the\r\ntable may have been, as she says, only a feeling of faintness.\r\nBesides, he's been dead two hours, and these manifestations always\r\ntake place at the exact moment of death, do they not?\"\r\n\r\nLambert brightened. \"That's so! But I'm scared of what'll happen if he\r\n_should_ manifest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be assured. He can no more 'manifest,' as you call it, than a dead\r\ndog. Keep the newspapers from your wife and daughter, and it will be a\r\nlong time before they learn of his death through any occult channel. I\r\nstake my reputation on that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish I felt as certain of that as you do,\" the miner answered.\r\n\"I've seen so many impossible things happen. I'm kind o' shaky. I wish\r\nI could have your help.\" He rose with a shiver of dread. \"You're\r\nright. I see that. We've got to get out of here, but it won't do to go\r\nback home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take ship and go abroad.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't do that. I can't leave my business so long.\" He paced up and\r\ndown. \"Suppose I had a telegram to meet a man in Montreal--a mining\r\nman.\"\r\n\r\n\"A good idea!\" exclaimed Morton. \"You could cross the border before\r\nthe news could overtake you. The Canadian papers will make little of\r\nthe suicide. But will your people go?\"\r\n\r\n\"They'll have to go,\" replied Lambert, firmly. \"Leave that to me.\" He\r\ntook a telegram from among several old ones in his pocket. \"I've just\r\nreceived this, you understand?\"\r\n\r\nKate knocked, and called; \"We're all ready, Morton?\"\r\n\r\nHe opened the door. \"Come in, Kate, I want to talk with you. I'm\r\nafraid our theatre-party is off. Mr. Lambert has received a very\r\nimportant message which may take him out of town.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm so sorry!\" cried Kate. \"Can't you wait till to-morrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid not,\" replied Lambert. \"Looks like I'd have to go\r\nto-night, and I want the girls to go along with me.\" And so saying,\r\nwith the telegram open in his hand, he went out into the sitting-room\r\nwhere Viola and her mother were standing dressed for the carriage.\r\n\"Girls,\" he called, persuasively. \"Don't you want to go to Montreal?\"\r\n\r\n\"When?\" inquired Viola.\r\n\r\n\"To-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, not to-night! We want to go to the theatre. Wait till to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nKate was about to join in this protest when Morton drew her into his\r\nstudy and shut the door. \"Don't stop them!\" he said, almost fiercely.\r\n\"They must go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to escape Clarke?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Clarke, or rather his ghost.\"\r\n\r\n\"His ghost! What do you mean?\" she asked, with startled eyes.\r\n\r\n\"He has killed himself--hush, now! they must not know it, and they\r\nmust flee. Don't you see that this may undo all my plans for the\r\ngirl's redemption and may enslave her more deeply than ever? The\r\npapers will be full of Clarke to-morrow morning. Pratt's wealth, my\r\nconnection, with an institution, insures a tremendous scare-head. The\r\nmother will be conscious-wrung, and the whole weight of the infernal\r\ntragedy will crush down on Viola. The only possible respite for her is\r\nto cross the border into Canada, outrun the newsmongers, and trust in\r\ntime to heal her mental derangements.\"\r\n\r\nKate's eyes expanded with the same fear that filled Lambert. \"You\r\ndon't suppose he will be able to haunt her? Was that what happened at\r\nthe table?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not in the sense you mean. He is dead, and I have no fear of his\r\nghost, but the memory of him will torture her soul; and if she\r\n_believes_ that he is able to come to her, the belief will be almost\r\nas tragic as the fact.\"\r\n\r\n\"Morton, it is a test!\" she exclaimed, with breathless solemnity. \"If\r\nthere is any truth in spiritualism, he will manifest himself to her\r\nand you cannot prevent it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it is a test and I welcome it! I stake all that I am on the\r\nissue. She was at her merriest when he was dying. She has no hint of\r\nhis deed at this moment, and with all her clairvoyance I am perfectly\r\ncertain she will not be able to read what is in our minds if you can\r\nrestrain your tongue. If you can't do that, I beg of you to stay in\r\nyour room.\" He was harsh and curt in his tone; and she shrank from\r\nhim. \"Her mental health, her sanity, may be in peril.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can keep silence,\" she replied, \"But, oh, Morton, think of that\r\npoor girl--up there in some bleak hotel in Canada, with only these two\r\nold people! Suppose _he does_ come to her there, what can they do?\r\nWouldn't it be better to keep her here--let her learn it here--where\r\nyou can help her?\"\r\n\r\n\"And be haled before the coroner, to be charged perhaps with poisoning\r\nClarke, or some other equally monstrous thing? No, I have been all\r\nover the ground, and I tell you there is no other way. She must go\r\nto-night. The police may arrive at any moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you must go with her,\" she retorted, with a decision almost\r\nequal to his own. \"She needs you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no. I can't do that,\" he replied, impatiently, almost angrily. \"I\r\nwould be accused of abducting her. It is utterly out of the question.\"\r\n\r\nKate, knowing that she was asking a good deal, went resolutely on:\r\n\"She has no one but you to lean upon. She trusts you, and she ought to\r\nhave some strong, sane person on whom to rely. I would be worse than\r\nuseless up there. I am scared out of my wits at thought of Clarke's\r\npossible revenge upon _her_! Besides, by going with her you will\r\nescape some of the notoriety about to thrust upon you.\"\r\n\r\nHe was plainly vacillating. \"Think of the fat news-items my flight\r\nwill add to the stew.\"\r\n\r\nKate shuddered. \"Oh, I know! I hope you don't blame me.--It's true, I\r\n_am_ to blame. I _did_ insist on your going to see her.\" She was\r\nbeginning to suffer with this thought, when he put out his hand and\r\ndrew her to him with affectionate wish to comfort her.\r\n\r\n\"Don't assume that worry, Kit. She profoundly interested me from the\r\nfirst, and I do not regret my acquaintance with her--even at this\r\nmoment. I believe she is essentially untouched by this business and\r\nthat she can be cleansed of all Clarke's influence. His death removes\r\nher worst enemy; and if I can persuade her parents to leave her with\r\nus, I am perfectly certain I can root out the deepest of her\r\ndelusions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then go,\" she said, in final surrender. \"Conventions ought not to\r\ncount against saving a sweet, good girl. Go and help her, and if you\r\nbring her back here, I'll receive her gladly.\"\r\n\r\nMorton opened the door, and while Kate went to Viola he said: \"Mr.\r\nLambert, if you will add me to your party, I will be glad to go with\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nLambert seized his host's hand and wrung it hard. \"My boy, you save my\r\nlife! I thought of asking you, but I couldn't find the nerve. We'll\r\nall need you--the girl worst of all.\" Tears were in his eyes as he\r\nadded, huskily; \"Yes, we need you.\"\r\n\r\nViola, with shining face, came running towards them, \"Oh, Professor\r\nServiss! Is it true? Are you going?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, if you will let me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let you! Oh, you don't know what it means to have you with us.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked down upon her with a smile whose full message she could not\r\nread, but it expressed something very tender and disconcerting. \"You\r\ncan't know what it means to me to go. You see, I daren't quite trust\r\nyou alone with these indulgent parents and as your physician it is my\r\nduty to see that my prescriptions are fully carried out.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the bustle of preparation for the journey, he found opportunity\r\nto reassure Kate: \"Thus far, she has no inkling of what is in our\r\nminds.\" He closed his fist as if shaking it in the face of an\r\nimplacable foe, and, through his set teeth, added: \"I accept the\r\nchallenge! I welcome you and all your dark band to the utterance!\"\r\n\r\nKate turned pale. \"Don't say that!\" she whispered. \"It's like tempting\r\nProvidence.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear neither Providence nor demons; but I am afraid of you. Keep\r\naway from Viola as much as you can. If there is any truth in\r\nmind-reading she is likelier to divine your thought than mine.\"\r\n\r\nKate's eyes suddenly grew dim. \"Morton, I brought this on you, and I'm\r\nbeginning to doubt. I don't believe I want you to go with her, after\r\nall.\" She put her hands on his shoulders and gave way to a feeling of\r\nloss and loneliness. \"I've always hoped--I've always looked forward\r\nto your having a splendid, dignified wife; and though I like her. I\r\ndon't believe--she's up to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, don't trouble about that, sis. The important thing to me is, am\r\nI worthy of her? She entered my heart the first time I saw her, and\r\nhas never left it. She came at a time when I was certain no woman\r\nwould ever move me again. I am indebted to her--now, that's the truth.\r\nAnd so\"--he stooped and kissed her--\"if she decides to come to me, I\r\nshall feel grateful to you. If she decides not to come--you can be\r\ngrateful to her!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\nTHE SPIRITUAL RESCUE\r\n\r\n\r\nWith a conviction that he was entering upon a new order in his life,\r\nMorton Serviss opened the door of the coach for Viola and her mother.\r\nNever before had he evaded a contest, or asked for consideration from\r\nauthority, and deceit had been quite foreign to him; but now, after a\r\ndeceptive word to the hall-boy, he was conscious of furtively scanning\r\nthe people approaching on the walk, aware of his weakness and his\r\ndoubt, for no man of regular and candid life can become a fugitive\r\nwith entire belief in the righteousness of his flight. He must\r\nperforce of conscience look back for a moment.\r\n\r\nOnce within the carriage he put all question aside and joined Lambert\r\nin his attempt to keep from the women the slightest suspicion that his\r\nsudden departure involved any serious change in their fortunes. The\r\nminer had taken his place beside his wife, thus bringing the young\r\npeople side by side on the forward seat, and this arrangement had much\r\nto do with filling Morton's mind with a new and delicious content, for\r\nViola's face was almost constantly lifted to his, and at every lurch\r\nof the vehicle her soft shoulder touched his arm, while the faint\r\nperfume of her garments rose like some enchanter's incense, dulling\r\nhis sense of duties abandoned, quickening his delight in her beauty,\r\nand restoring his joy in his own youth. What did the judgment of the\r\nworld matter at such a time?\r\n\r\nHe said little on the ride, just enough to hold the conversation to\r\nsubjects far removed from the causes of their retreat. He was\r\nconvinced of Viola's ability to read (in a vague way) what lay in his\r\nthought, but he also believed in his power to prevent this by a\r\npositive and aggressive attitude of mind. Beneath his silences, as\r\nbeneath his words, ran an undercurrent of suggestion from his\r\nsubliminal self to hers. Lambert rose nobly to his duty and directed\r\nthe conversation to the mine and its increasing generosity of output,\r\nand to news of the men and their families in whom Viola took deep\r\ninterest. In the midst of this most wholesome recollection they ended\r\ntheir drive.\r\n\r\nAt the station Morton remained on guard with the women, while Lambert\r\nattended to the trunks and boxes, and at the earliest moment, with\r\ncare not to betray haste, they passed through the gates and into their\r\ncar, but no feeling of relief came to either of the men till the train\r\nbegan to move. Then Lambert, with a profound sigh, exclaimed: \"Well,\r\nnow we're off and we've got the trunks, so let's be happy.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lambert alone remained sad and distraught, and her husband soon\r\ndrew her away to their own seat, leaving the young people together, a\r\ndeed for which Morton silently, but none the less fervently, thanked\r\nhim, affording as it did the chance for his long-desired personal\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nThe car was sparsely occupied and the section opposite was quite\r\nempty, and, with a sense of being quite alone with Viola, he lightly\r\nbegan: \"I feel like a truant school-boy, and I'm wondering what\r\nWeissmann will say to-morrow morning when his 'first-assistant' fails\r\nto appear.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope you are not neglecting your work for--for us,\" she said,\r\nlosing a little of her brightness.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing will suffer. I do not profess to be the main prop of our\r\nlaboratory, and, besides, I don't care. I'm off for a holiday, whether\r\nor no.\" At the word \"holiday\" Clarke's grisly shadow rose between them\r\nand would not down. To the suicide his holiday was due.\r\n\r\nViola again seemed to dimly divine his thought, for she hesitatingly\r\nsaid: \"I am troubled about Mr. Clarke. I must write him a letter and\r\ntell him that I don't hate him now. I really begin to feel sorry for\r\nhim, and I wish I hadn't been so hard.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have nothing to reproach yourself for, and you would better let\r\nhim pass entirely out of your life, and be glad the wrench is over,\"\r\nhe decisively replied.\r\n\r\nShe sighed and shivered a little. \"He knew we were deserting him. His\r\nlook haunts me. I wish I had stopped to say good-bye. He will be very\r\nlonely without us.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is too fanatic to win my sympathy, and he has forfeited yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he was sincere, professor. He really wanted to make the world\r\nhappier.\"\r\n\r\nHe was resolute to keep her mind clear of all thought of Clarke, and\r\nimperiously said: \"Don't call me professor, and let's talk of other\r\nand pleasanter things than Clarke. We are well out of his\r\nshadow-world, and you are never to re-enter it. I want you to forget\r\nthat you ever sat in a 'circle' or heard a 'voice.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I can't expect to pass entirely out of that,\" she exclaimed, as\r\nthough the possibility came near her for the first time. \"On mother's\r\naccount I must continue to sit now and then. She couldn't live without\r\nher communion with papa and Waltie.\"\r\n\r\nThis brought him face to face with his opportunity, and he seized it\r\nmanfully. \"Your saying that, gives me opportunity for saying something\r\nwhich has been taking shape in my mind since last night. I do not\r\npretend to fully understand the basis of your mother's faith, and I do\r\nnot blame her, but I am filled with indignation that you should be\r\ncalled upon to suffer bondage to the dead. I rebel against it.\" His\r\nvoice was tense with feeling. \"And I will not have it so. I lunched\r\nto-day with Dr. Tolman, of whom you've heard me speak, and after\r\ndescribing your case to him--without using your name, of course--I\r\nasked his opinion. In reply he gave me every encouragement. The fact\r\nthat you are young and in good physical health, he said, makes it\r\npossible for you to become as normal as any other girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you believe that, Dr. Serviss?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am perfectly certain of it, if you will meet my conditions. I am\r\nconfident of my power to free you from your trances and all their\r\nphenomena, but you must, at once and for all time, break every tie\r\nthat binds you to your 'controls.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid they will not consent.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must not say such a thing, much less think it,\" he sharply\r\ninterrupted. \"Your soul, your mind, should be sovereign. You should\r\nlook rather to science for guidance\"--here he smiled meaningly--\"and\r\nto me, of course, as a representative of science. If you acknowledge\r\nthe authority of the dead, or even that of your mother, my power is to\r\nthat extent curtailed. It is to be in effect a war of light and\r\ndarkness, science and superstition. We are willing to join issue with\r\nyour shadow foes, provided your best self is with us in the struggle.\r\nI engage myself to free you if you will permit me to act.\"\r\n\r\nShe leaned towards him with pale face and limpid, heavenly eyes. \"You\r\nhave been good to me, but I cannot ask you to fight my battles. You\r\nhave so much else to do in the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have nothing better to do,\" he responded, with a lover's glance.\r\n\"Nothing can interest me so profoundly; nothing will give me greater\r\npleasure.\"\r\n\r\nShe went on, fervently: \"I can't tell you how you comfort me. When you\r\nare near me I have no fear of anything; but you oughtn't to give up\r\nyour work to treat me. We can never pay you for what you've already\r\ndone for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't try, and pray don't exaggerate my sacrifices. You must remember\r\nI am an investigator, and you--are a most absorbing problem.\" She drew\r\naway from him slightly, and he returned to a more serious tone. \"The\r\ninfluence of mind over mind is the present, or at least the coming,\r\nproblem, and you have opened a new world to me. The question of your\r\nfuture, your cure, absorbs me, and while I am by no means a rich man,\r\nas money runs these days, I am quite able to follow out any line of\r\ninvestigation which may interest me.\"\r\n\r\nHer face clouded, \"I wish I didn't have to be investigated.\"\r\n\r\n\"So do I, and that brings up something which I must say, even at the\r\nrisk of seeming hard and cruel. If you wish to live your full, free\r\nlife, you must cut yourself off from _all_ of your old associations.\r\nClarke and Pratt have passed out of your life, but your mother--\" He\r\npaused abruptly. When he resumed his tone was almost pleading: \"You\r\nhave said that you trusted me, that you wished for my help. Did you\r\nmean it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did, indeed I did!\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then,\" he went on, \"I will speak my mind. I must be very\r\ncandid, even if I seem harsh. When I say you must cut yourself off\r\nfrom all the associations of the past, I mean your mother also.\"\r\n\r\nShe started up in dismay, understanding his full meaning at last. \"Oh\r\nno, not that!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, just that, and finally that. She is your mother, and you love\r\nher; but you are a human soul as well as she, with a right to healthy,\r\nnormal life. It is contrary to the law of progress to sacrifice the\r\nyoung to the old. Your mother's comfort has been your undoing, and I\r\ncannot for an instant agree to your submission of this question to\r\nher. You must assert your right to yourself, and she must surrender\r\nher authority to me, and she must leave you for a time. I would say\r\nthis even if my own mother spoke to me through you. Your struggles\r\ntear my heart, and your mother's presence only prolongs your\r\nsufferings.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must not blame her,\" she loyally insisted. \"I am to blame. My\r\nguides tell me that if I would surrender myself completely to them I\r\nwould find peace,\" she ended, slowly, sadly, as if in confession.\r\n\r\n\"Peace! Yes, the peace of the epileptic or the mad. No, no, joy and\r\nhealth do not lie that way. If I were the scientist merely, I would\r\nsay, 'Keep on, and I will stand by to observe your struggles.' But I\r\nam not, I am something else than scientist. It angers and agonizes me\r\nto see you tortured. I cannot endure it and I will not. In order that\r\nI may do all that I hope for, you must give yourself wholly into my\r\ncare.\" He was speaking now in a low and throbbing voice, oblivious of\r\ntime and space. \"I must be something more than physician or friend. I\r\nhave been saying 'must' to you, but I am, after all, a very strange\r\nautocrat. My power is dependent on you.\" Then, in answer to her\r\nquestioning eyes, he hurried on: \"I love you, dear girl, and if you\r\nfind you can trust yourself to me, fully, in this way, then I am sure\r\nof victory. Can you say this? I hope you can, for then I will have the\r\nmost powerful magician in all the world fighting on my side. Are you\r\nable to do this? Can you say you love me and that you will come to me,\r\ntrusting in me as in a husband?\"\r\n\r\nNo one was astir in the car but the porter, but had it been filled\r\nwith clamoring tongues and seeking, impertinent eyes, she would have\r\nbeen conscious only of his tender glance, his earnest voice, and the\r\nmomentous question being pressed upon her. She struggled to speak, but\r\ncould not, and he hastened on: \"I will be honest with you. Your mother\r\ndoes not trust me. She knows and resents my feeling towards you. She\r\nknows also that I consider her separation from you necessary, for a\r\ntime, and is hurt and saddened by it; but she will come to see the\r\nnecessity of this measure. I do not ask an immediate answer--though I\r\nwish your heart were mine this minute--but I do want you to know that\r\nfrom the first moment I saw you your life has been a part of mine. I\r\ncould not forget you, though I tried to do so, and I will not now give\r\nyou up.\"\r\n\r\nShe still sat like an exquisite statue of meditation, looking out into\r\nthe night, benumbed and breathless with the passion his words evoked.\r\nSuddenly she turned and vehemently exclaimed: \"You ought not to ask me\r\nthis. I'm not fit to be your wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me be the judge of that.\"\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: \"'YOU NEED NOT SPEAK--JUST PUT YOUR HAND IN MINE\r\n   AND I WILL UNDERSTAND'\"]\r\n\r\n\"But you don't realize what I am. You must not think of me in that\r\nway. I can't let you. I _am_ different from other women. You must not\r\ndeceive yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not. I know, to my joy, that you are different from other girls;\r\nthat is why I am here and asking you to be my wife. That is why I\r\nloved you that day on the mountain-side, because you were different.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\" she despairingly exclaimed. \"You don't understand. I mean\r\nthat I _am_ surrounded by spirits, and they will make you ashamed of\r\nme. Think what your friends would say?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not responsible to my friends. I don't care what they say. They\r\nare not choosing my wife for me. I _do_ know what you mean, and your\r\nprotest increases my love for you. I am not concerned with your\r\nghosts--only with your character.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I am a _medium_!\" she went on, desperately. \"I have this awful\r\npower. You're all wrong about mother and Mr. Clarke. They have nothing\r\nto do with what happens.\" Her beautiful hands were clinched and her\r\nface set in the resolution to force her confession upon him. Her bosom\r\nrose and fell piteously as she struggled for words, \"You must not\r\nmisunderstand me. I believe in the spirit-world. Sometimes I say I\r\ndon't, but I do.\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke soothingly: \"There is nothing wrong or disgraceful in your\r\ntheory; it is your practice of trance, of mediumship, to which I\r\nobject, and which I intend to prevent.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want you to do that. I hate my trances and those public circles.\r\nBut will that put an end to the rappings and other things that go on\r\naround me when I am awake? That is the question.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the question, but he rode sturdily over it, resolute to\r\nsubordinate it if not to trample it under foot.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. The real question is very simple: can you trust yourself\r\nto me, fully, because you love me? If you do I will answer for the\r\nrest. I do not know why you meant so much to me that day. I do not\r\nknow why, out of all the women I know, you move me most profoundly;\r\nbut so it is and I am glad to have it so.\" He said this with a grave\r\ntenderness which moved her like a phrase from some great symphony, and\r\nas she raised her tear-stained, timid face to his she saw him as he\r\nseemed at that first meeting on the mountain-side, in the sunset glow,\r\nso manly, so frank, so full of power that he conquered her with a\r\nglance, and with that vision she knew her heart. Her eyes fell, her\r\nthroat thickened, and her bosom throbbed with a strange yearning. She\r\nloved, but the way of confession was hard.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding her emotion, and mindful of the place in which they sat,\r\nhe softly said: \"You need not speak--just put your hand in mine and I\r\nwill understand.\"\r\n\r\nHer hand, like some shy sentient thing, first drew away, fell\r\nhesitant, then leaped to his and nestled in his palm. He had planned\r\nto be very restrained and very circumspect, but the touch of her\r\ntrembling fingers moved him out of his predetermined self-possession,\r\nand, careless of all the surroundings, he stooped and kissed her, then\r\nexultantly, warningly said: \"Remember, I am now your chief 'control,'\r\nand there are to be no other 'guides' but me.\"\r\n\r\nWith those words, all fear, all question, all care (save that vague\r\ndistrust which the maiden feels when yielding herself to the first\r\ncaress of the lover) dropped from her. The powers, the hallucinations,\r\nwhich had separated her from the world of womankind were forgotten,\r\nlost in the glow of her confidence and love.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    +-----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n    | Typographical errors corrected in text:                   |\r\n    |                                                           |\r\n    | Page 358: Lombrosco replaced with Lombroso                |\r\n    |                                                           |\r\n    +-----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Tyranny of the Dark, by Hamlin Garland",

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks."
