Let's\r\ngive a dinner to my old friends of Mrs. Smithers's; they were nice old\r\npeople, and I should like to get them together again. I saw Dr. Pedagog\r\nin the city yesterday, and he inquired most affectionately, not to say\r\nanxiously, about the children.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should he be anxious about the children?\" asked Mrs. Idiot,\r\nplacidly, as she sweetened her husband's coffee. \"Does he suspect them\r\nof lacking completeness or variety?\"\r\n\r\nThe Idiot tapped his forehead significantly.\r\n\r\n\"He didn't know whether they take after you or after me, but I relieved\r\nhis mind on that score,\" he said. \"I told him that they didn't take\r\nafter anybody that either of us ever knew. They have started in on a\r\nline of Idiocy that is entirely their own. He seemed very much pleased\r\nwhen I said that, and observed that he was glad to hear it.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Idiot laughed.\r\n\r\n\"It was very nice of the Doctor to ask about them, but I am a little\r\nafraid he wants to take a hand in their bringing up,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"No doubt of it,\" said the Idiot. \"Pedagog always was anxious to\r\nexperiment. Many a time I have suspected him of having designs even on\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Pedagog told me last year that he had devised an entirely new\r\nsystem of home training,\" observed Mrs. Idiot, \"and they both regretted\r\nthat they had no children of their own to try it on.\"\r\n\r\n\"And of course you offered to lend Tommy to them?\" said the Idiot, with\r\na sly glance at his son, who was stowing away his oatmeal at a rate that\r\nbade fair to create a famine.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said Mrs. Idiot. \"He's got to get raw material somewhere,\r\nand I thought Tommy would be just the thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I ain't a-goin',\" said Tommy, helping himself liberally and for\r\nthe third time to the oatmeal.\r\n\r\n\"My son,\" said the Idiot, with a mock show of sternness, \"if your mother\r\nchooses to lend you to any one it is not for you to say that you 'ain't\r\na-goin'. It may be that I shall interfere to the extent of demanding to\r\nknow what security for your safe return is offered, but otherwise\r\nneither you nor I shall intervene. What your mother says is law for you\r\nas well as for me. Please understand that, Thomas.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, pa,\" said Tommy; and then he added in an undertone,\r\npresumably to the butter, \"But I ain't a-goin', just the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll go,\" said Mollie, who rather liked the idea of being lent to\r\nsomebody, since it involved a visit to some strange and therefore\r\nfascinating spot away from home. \"Lend me to somebody, will you, mamma?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, ma, lend Mollie to 'em,\" said Tommy, with, a certain dry\r\nenthusiasm, \"and then maybe you can borrow a boy from somebody else for\r\nme to play with. I don't see why you don't swap her off for a boy,\r\nanyhow. I like her well enough, but what you ever wanted to buy her for\r\nin the beginning I don't know. Girls isn't any good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thomas,\" said the Idiot, \"you talk too much, and, what is more, you say\r\nvain things which some day you will regret. When you get older you will\r\nrecall this dictum of yours, that 'girls isn't any good,' with a blush\r\nof shame, and remember that your mother was once a girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, she's outgrown it,\" said Tommy; and then reverting to his\r\nfather's choice of words, he added, \"What is dictums, anyhow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pooh!\" cried the little girl. \"Smarty don't know what dictums is!\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose you two young persons subside for a few minutes!\" interrupted\r\nthe Idiot. \"I wish to talk to your mother, and I haven't got all day.\r\nYou'll be wanting some bread and butter to-morrow, and I must go to town\r\nand earn it.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, pa,\" said Tommy. \"I ain't got anything to say that I can't\r\nsay to myself. I'd rather talk to myself, anyhow. You can be as sassy--\"\r\n\r\n\"Thomas!\" said the Idiot, severely.\r\n\r\n\"All right, pa,\" said Tommy; and with a side remark to the cream-jug,\r\nthat he still thought Mollie ought to be swapped off for something, it\r\ndidn't matter what as long as it wasn't another girl, the boy lapsed\r\ninto a deep though merely temporary silence.\r\n\r\n\"You said you'd like to give a dinner to Mr. and Mrs. Pedagog and the\r\nothers,\" said Mrs. Idiot. \"I quite approve.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it would be nice,\" returned the Idiot. \"It has been more than\r\nsix years since we were all together.\"\r\n\r\n\"You wouldn't prefer having them at breakfast, would you?\" asked Mrs.\r\nIdiot, with a smile. \"I remember hearing you say once that breakfast was\r\nyour best time.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long is six years, pa?\" asked Tommy.\r\n\r\n\"Really, Thomas,\" replied the Idiot, severely, \"you are the most absurd\r\ncreature. How long is six years!\"\r\n\r\n\"I meant in inches,\" said Tommy, unabashed. \"You always told me to ask\r\nyou when I wanted to know things. Of course, if you don't know--\"\r\n\r\n\"It's more'n a mile, I guess,\" observed Mollie, with some superiority of\r\nmanner. \"Ain't it, pa?\"\r\n\r\nThe Idiot glanced at his wife in despair.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think, my dear, that I am as strong at breakfast as I used to\r\nbe,\" said he. \"There was a time when I could hold my own, but things\r\nseem to have changed. Make it dinner; and, Tommy, when you have deep\r\nproblems to solve, like how long is six years in inches, try to work\r\nthem out for yourself. It will fix the results more firmly in your\r\nmind.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, pa,\" replied Tommy; \"I thought maybe you knew. I thought you\r\nsaid you knew everything.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"POSSESSED A LIBRARY OF FIRST EDITIONS\"]\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the Idiot's suggestion the invitations were sent out.\r\nIt was a most agreeable proposition as far as his wife was concerned,\r\nfor the Idiot's old associates, his fellow-boarders at Mrs.\r\nSmithers-Pedagog's \"High-Class Home for Single Gentlemen,\" had proved\r\nto be the stanchest of his friends. They had, as time passed on, gone\r\ntheir several ways. The Poet had made himself so famous that even his\r\nbad things got into print; the Bibliomaniac, by an unexpected stroke of\r\nfortune, had come into possession of his own again, and now possessed a\r\nlibrary of first editions that auctioneers looked upon with envious\r\neyes, and which aroused the hatred of many another collector. The Doctor\r\nhad prospered equally, and was now one of the most successful operators\r\nfor appendicitis; in fact, could now afford to refuse all other practice\r\nthan that involved in that delicate and popular line of work. The genial\r\ngentleman who occasionally imbibed had not wholly reformed, but, as the\r\nIdiot put it, had developed into one who occasionally did _not_ imbibe.\r\nMr. Brief had become an assistant district attorney, and was prominently\r\nmentioned for a judgeship, and Mr. and Mrs. Pedagog lived placidly along\r\ntogether, never for an instant regretting the inspiration which led them\r\nto economize by making two into one. In short, time and fortune had\r\ndealt kindly with all, even with Mary, the housemaid, who was now\r\ngeneral manager of the nursery in the Idiot's household.\r\n\r\nThe home life of \"Mr. and Mrs. Idiot\" had been all that either of the\r\nyoung people could have wished for, and prosperity had waited upon them\r\nin all things. The Idiot had become a partner in the business of his\r\nfather-in-law, and even in bad times had managed to save something,\r\nuntil now, with two children, aged five and six, he found himself the\r\npossessor of his own home in a suburban city. It had been finished only\r\na month when the proposed dinner was first mentioned, and the natural\r\npride of its master and mistress was delightful to look upon.\r\n\r\n\"Why, do you know, my dear,\" said the Idiot one evening, on his return\r\nfrom town, \"they are talking of asking me to resign from the club\r\nbecause they say I am offensive about this place, and Watson says my\r\nconversation has become a bore to everybody because the burden of my\r\nsong yesterday was pots and pans and kettles and things like that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose clubmen are not interested in pots and pans and kettles and\r\nthings,\" Mrs. Idiot observed. \"Some people aren't, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not interested?\" echoed the Idiot. \"What kind of people can they be not\r\nto be interested in pots and pans and kettles and things? I guess it's\r\nbecause of their dense ignorance.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'THEY NEVER HAD THE FUN OF BUYING THEM'\"]\r\n\r\n\"They never had the fun of buying them, perhaps,\" suggested Mrs. Idiot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'GUARANTEED TO HANG ONTO A GARMENT IN A GALE'\"]\r\n\r\n\"Possibly,\" assented the Idiot. \"And I'll tell you one thing, Pollie,\r\ndear,\" he added, \"if they had had that fun just once, instead of\r\nsquandering their savings on clothes and the theatre, and on horses,\r\nyou'd find every blessed one of those chaps thronging the hardware shops\r\nall day and spending their money there. Why, do you know I even enjoyed\r\ngetting the clothes-pins, and what is more, it was instructive. I never\r\nknew before what countless varieties of clothes-pins there were. There's\r\nthe plain kind of commerce that look like a pair of legs with a polo-cap\r\non. I was brought up on those, and I used to steal them when I was a\r\nsmall boy, to act as understudies for Noah and Shem and Ham and Japheth\r\nin my Noah's ark. Then there's the patent kind with a spring to it that\r\nis guaranteed to hang onto a garment in a gale if it has to let go of\r\nthe rope. Very few people realize the infinite variety of the\r\nclothes-pin, and when I try to tell these chaps at the club about it\r\nthey yawn and try to change the subject to things like German opera and\r\nimpressionism and international complications.\"\r\n\r\n\"How foolish of them!\" laughed Mrs. Idiot. \"The idea of preferring to\r\ntalk of Wagner when one can discourse upon clothes-pins!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid you are sarcastic,\" rejoined the Idiot. \"But you needn't\r\nbe; if you'd only reason it out you'd see at once that my view is\r\ncorrect. Anybody can talk about Wagner. Any person who knows a picture\r\nfrom a cable-car can talk with seeming intelligence on art, and even a\r\nmember of Congress can talk about international complications off-hand\r\nfor hours; but how many of these people know about clothes-pins?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very few,\" said Mrs. Idiot, meekly.\r\n\r\n\"Very few, indeed,\" observed the Idiot. \"And the same way with\r\negg-beaters. I'll bet you a laundry-stove that if I should write to the\r\n_Recorder_ to-morrow morning, and ask a question about Wagner, the\r\nmusical editor would give me an answer within twenty-four hours; but\r\nwith reference to egg-beaters it would take 'em a week to find out. And\r\nthat's just the trouble. The newspapers are filled up with stuff that\r\neverybody knows about, but they don't know a thing about other things on\r\nthe subject of which the public is ignorant.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" said Mrs. Idiot, reflectively, \"that that is probably due to\r\nthe fact that they consider Wagner more important than an egg-beater.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'AND SOME PEOPLE SAY WAGNER IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN\r\nTHAT'\"]\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, they don't know, that's all,\" rejoined the Idiot, rising\r\nand walking out into the kitchen and taking the fascinating object over\r\nwhich he was waxing so enthusiastic from the dresser drawer. \"Just look\r\nat that!\" he cried, turning the cog-wheel which set the three\r\nintersecting metal loops whizzing like a squirrel in its wheel-cage.\r\n\"Just look at that! It's beautiful, and some people say Wagner is more\r\nimportant than that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I must say, my dear,\" said Mrs. Idiot, \"that I have a leaning\r\nthat way myself. Of course, I admit the charm of the egg-beater, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me one thing,\" demanded the Idiot. \"Can you get along without\r\nWagner?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes,\" Mrs. Idiot replied, \"if I have to.\"\r\n\r\n\"And can you get along without an egg-beater?\" he cried, triumphantly.\r\n\r\nThe evidence was overwhelming, and Mrs. Idiot, with an appreciative\r\nebullition of mirth, acknowledged herself defeated, and so charmingly\r\nwithal, that the next day when her husband returned home he brought her\r\ntwo tickets for the opera of Siegfried as a reward for her graceful\r\nsubmission.\r\n\r\n\"I could have bought ten dozen muffin-rings for the same money,\" said\r\nhe, as he gave them to her, \"but people who know when to give in, and do\r\ngive in as amiably as you do, my dear, deserve to be rewarded; and, on\r\nthe whole, when you use these tickets, if you'll ask me, I think I'll\r\nescort you to Siegfried myself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nA LITTLE DINNER TO SOME OLD FRIENDS\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"TOMMY AND MOLLIE GAVE THE COOK A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE\"]\r\n\r\nTen days later all was excitement at the Idiot's new home. Tommy and\r\nMollie were in a state bordering upon frenzy, and gave the cook a great\r\ndeal of trouble, requesting a taste of this, that, and the other thing,\r\nwhich she was preparing for the dinner to Mr. and Mrs. Pedagog, the\r\nBibliomaniac, and the others. Inwardly, too, they were somewhat\r\nwrathful, for they could not understand why they were not permitted to\r\ndine with their parents as usual.\r\n\r\n\"I guess maybe it's your manners that keeps you away, Tommy,\" said\r\nMollie.\r\n\r\n\"Hoh!\" said Tommy. \"It can't be that, because pa says I ain't got any.\r\nIt's because you're too young to be introdoosed into society, and I've\r\ngot to stay up-stairs and look after you. If you weren't a girl!\"\r\n\r\nHere Tommy clenched his fists and looked unutterable things. Mollie\r\nshuddered and was glad she was a girl as she imagined the awful things\r\nTommy would do to her had she been a boy.\r\n\r\n\"Neither of 'em's it, Tommy,\" she said, in a conciliatory manner. \"It's\r\nbecause they ain't got enough dining-room chairs, that's why. I know,\r\nbecause I counted 'em, and there's only eight, and there's nine people\r\ncomin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess maybe that's it,\" said Tommy, pacified somewhat. \"And anyhow, I\r\ndon't care. I saw that piece of paper ma gave Jennie, and she wrote down\r\nall the things they're goin' to have, and it's goin' to be two hours\r\nbetween the soup and the ice-cream. I couldn't ever wait that long for\r\nthe ice-cream. I don't see why they don't begin with ice-cream.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess maybe we're better off as it is,\" said Mollie. \"Popper and\r\nmommer ain't likely to forget us, and, besides, we can talk.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with this comforting reflection the little ones retired to their\r\nnursery contented in mind and spirit--and they didn't suffer a bit.\r\nTheir \"popper and mommer\" didn't forget them. The ice-cream was\r\nexcellent, and they had their share of it almost before the guests began\r\nwith their oysters.\r\n\r\nAt seven o'clock Mr. and Mrs. Pedagog had arrived, and at seven-ten all\r\nthe invited guests were present.\r\n\r\n\"If it hadn't been for my wife,\" Mr. Pedagog whispered in his host's\r\near, \"I should have been late, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't apologize, old man,\" replied the Idiot, gripping the\r\nSchoolmaster's hand warmly. \"I sometimes go to dinners on time myself.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few moments dinner was announced, and shortly after all were\r\nseated, and in memory of old times the guests naturally waited for the\r\nIdiot to begin.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know,\" he said, as he squeezed the juice from a luscious lemon\r\nover an unprotesting oyster, at the same time glancing affectionately\r\nover the company, \"I haven't felt so much at home for years as I do\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not very complimentary to your wife,\" said Mr. Brief.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I know what he means,\" observed Mrs. Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"And I have so many other opportunities to compliment her,\" said the\r\nIdiot.\r\n\r\n\"But really, Mrs. Pedagog,\" he added, addressing the good lady who sat\r\nat his right, \"I feel absolutely contented to-night. All the good things\r\nof the past and of the present seem to be concentrated about this\r\nboard--except the three up-stairs, who can't very well be here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Three?\" asked Mr. Pedagog. \"I thought there were only two--\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said the Idiot. \"Tommy and Mollie, but there is Mary, your\r\nold housemaid. We can't very well ask them to dine with us, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see why Tommy and Mollie can't be invited,\" said Mr. Pedagog,\r\nmuch to the Idiot's surprise, it seemed so like a violation of his\r\nsystem, as it might be presumed to be.\r\n\r\n\"You believe in having children at table, then, Mr. Pedagog?\" asked Mrs.\r\nIdiot.\r\n\r\n\"Most certainly,\" said the Schoolmaster. Mrs. Pedagog glanced smilingly\r\nat Mrs. Idiot, as much as to say, \"Oh, these men!\"\r\n\r\n\"I certainly do approve of having children at table on all occasions,\"\r\nhe continued. \"How else are they to learn how to conduct themselves? The\r\ndiscipline of the nursery is apt to be lax, and it is my belief that\r\nmany of the bad table manners of the present-day child are due to the\r\nsense of freedom which eating dinner in the nursery naturally\r\ninculcates.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is something in what you say,\" said the Idiot. \"Tommy, for\r\ninstance, never learned to throw a French pancake across the table at\r\nhis sister by watching his mother and myself here in the dining-room,\r\nyet in the freedom of the nursery I have known it done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely,\" said Mr. Pedagog. \"That very little incident illustrates my\r\npoint exactly. And I have no doubt that in the nursery the offence\r\nseemed less heinous than it would had it occurred in the dining-room,\r\nand hence did not meet with the full measure of punishment that it\r\ndeserved.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have forgotten exactly what was done on that occasion,\" said the\r\nIdiot, calmly. \"It is my impression that I compelled Thomas to eat the\r\npancake.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure I never heard of the incident before,\" said Mrs. Idiot, her\r\ncheeks growing very red. \"He didn't really, did he, dear?\"\r\n\r\n\"By jove!\" cried the Idiot, snapping his forefinger against his thumb,\r\n\"what a traitor I am, to be sure. I promised Thomas never to tell, and\r\nhere I've given the poor little chap away; but the boy was excusable, I\r\nassure you all--that is, he was excusable in a sense. Mollie had\r\npreviously hit him in the eye with a salted almond, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"It is quite evident,\" put in Mrs. Pedagog, her womanly sympathy leading\r\nher to rush to the aid of Mrs. Idiot, who seemed somewhat mortified over\r\nthe Idiot's confidences, \"that you were not at home, my dear. I have\r\nmyself observed that extraordinary episodes of this nature generally\r\nhappen when it is the father who is left in charge of the children.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite right, Mrs. Pedagog,\" said the Doctor, nodding his head gravely.\r\n\"I have noticed the same thing in my professional practice. As long as\r\nthe mother is about discipline is maintained, but once leave the father\r\nin charge and riot is the order of the day.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's exactly what I was going to say,\" said the Idiot. \"Many a time\r\nwhen Mrs. Idiot has gone out shopping, as she did on the day in\r\nquestion, and I have remained at home for a rest, I have wished\r\nbefore evening came that I had gone shopping and let my wife have the\r\nrest. As a matter of fact, the bringing up of children should be left to\r\nthe mother--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but the father should have something to do with it,\" interrupted\r\nMrs. Idiot. \"It is too great a responsibility to place on a woman's\r\nshoulders.\"\r\n\r\n\"You didn't let me finish, my dear,\" said the Idiot, amiably. \"I was\r\ngoing to say that the mother should bring the children up, and the\r\nfather should take 'em down when they get up too high.\"\r\n\r\n\"My views to a dot,\" said Mr. Pedagog, with more enthusiasm than he had\r\never yet shown over the Idiot's dicta. \"Just as in ordinary colonial\r\ngovernment, the home authorities should govern, and when necessary a\r\nstronger power should intervene.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ideal--is it not?\" laughed Mrs. Idiot, addressing Mrs. Pedagog. \"The\r\nmother, Spain. The children, Cuba. Papa, the great and glorious United\r\nStates!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ahem! Well,\" said Mr. Pedagog, \"I didn't mean that exactly, you know--\"\r\n\r\n\"But it's what you said, John,\" said Mrs. Pedagog, somewhat severely.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'LET THE FATHERS LOOK AFTER THE CHILDREN AT NIGHT'\"]\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't see why there can't be a division of responsibility,\"\r\nsaid the Poet, who had never married, and who knew children only as a\r\ntheory. \"Let the mothers look after them in the daytime, and the fathers\r\nat night.\"\r\n\r\nThis sally was greeted with an outburst of applause, it was so\r\npractical.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me!\" said the Idiot. \"I'm not selfish, but I don't want to have\r\ncharge of the children at night. Why, when Tommy was cutting his teeth I\r\nsuffered agonies when night came on. I was down-town all day, and so\r\nwasn't very much bothered then, but at night it was something awful. Not\r\nonly Tommy's tooth, but the fear that his mother would tread on a tack.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was unselfish,\" said Mr. Pedagog, dryly. \"You weren't afraid of\r\ntreading on one yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"How could I?\" said the Idiot. \"I had all I could do trying to keep my\r\nwife from knowing that I was disturbed. It is bad enough to be worried\r\nover a crying babe, without being bothered by an irritated husband, so I\r\nsimply lay there pretending to be asleep and snoring away for dear\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are the most considerate man I ever heard of,\" said Mrs. Pedagog,\r\nsmiling broadly.\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean to say,\" said the Poet, with a frown, \"that you made\r\nyour wife get up and take all the trouble and bother--\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd only have been in the way,\" said the Idiot, meekly.\r\n\r\n\"So he kept quiet and pretended to snore like the good old Idiot that he\r\nis,\" put in the Doctor. \"And he did the right thing, too,\" he added. \"If\r\nall fathers would obliterate themselves on occasions of that sort, and\r\nlet the mothers rule, the Tommys and Dickies and Harrys would go to\r\nsleep a great deal more quickly.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are rambling,\" said Mr. Pedagog. \"The question of a father's duty\r\ntowards a teething son has nothing to do with the question of a child's\r\nright to dine with his parents.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" said the Idiot. \"If we are to consider this matter\r\nscientifically we must start right. Teething is a natural first step,\r\nfor if a child hath no teeth, wherewithal shall he eat dinners with his\r\nparents or without them?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is all very well,\" retorted Mr. Pedagog, \"but to discuss\r\nfire-engines intelligently it is not necessary to go back to the times\r\nof Elisha to begin it.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Whitechoker--now the Rev. Theophilus Whitechoker, D.D., for he, too,\r\nhad prospered--smiled deprecatingly. There is no man in the world who\r\nmore thoroughly appreciates a biblical joke than the prosperous\r\nclergyman.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the Idiot, reflectively, \"I quite agree with your\r\nproposition that children should dine in the dining-room with their\r\nparents and not up-stairs in the nursery, with a lot of tin soldiers and\r\ngolliwogs. The manners of parents are no better than those of tin\r\nsoldiers and golliwogs, but their conversation is apt to prove more\r\ninstructive; and as for the stern father who says his children must dine\r\nin the kitchen until they learn better manners, I never had much\r\nconfidence in him or in his manners, either.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see,\" said the genial old gentleman who occasionally imbibed,\r\n\"how you can discipline children in the nursery. If they misbehave in\r\nthe dining-room you can send them up-stairs to the nursery, but if they\r\nmisbehave in the nursery, where the deuce can you send them?\"\r\n\r\n\"To bed,\" said Mr. Brief.\r\n\r\n\"Never!\" cried the Idiot. \"Children, Mr. Brief, as I understand\r\nthem--and I have known three very well; myself as a boy, and Tommy and\r\nMollie--children, as I understand them, are never naughty for the mere\r\nfun of being so. Their wickedness grows out of their wonderful stores of\r\nunexpended and unexpendable energy. Take my son Thomas on last Saturday\r\nafternoon, for instance. It was a rainy Saturday, and Tommy, instead of\r\nbeing out-of-doors all morning and afternoon getting rid of his\r\nsuperfluous vitality, had been cooped up in the house all day doing\r\nnothing. Shortly before dinner we had a difference of opinion which\r\nlasted for more time than I like to think about. I was tired and\r\nirritable. Tommy wasn't tired, but he _was_ irritable, and, from his\r\npoint of view, was as right as I was. He had the best of me to the\r\nextent that I was tired and he wasn't. I had the best of him to the\r\nextent that I had authority and he hadn't--\"\r\n\r\n\"And who came out ahead?\" asked Mr. Pedagog.\r\n\r\n\"I did,\" said the Idiot, \"because I was bigger than he was; but what I\r\nwas going to say was this: Mr. Brief would have sent him to bed,\r\nthereby adding to the boy's stock of energy, already too great for his\r\nlittle mind to control.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what did you do?\" asked Mr. Brief.\r\n\r\n\"Nothin',\" said a small but unmistakably masculine voice from behind the\r\nportieres.\r\n\r\n\"Thomas!\" said the Idiot, severely, as all turned to see who had spoken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"A LITTLE FIGURE CLAD IN WHITE\"]\r\n\r\nA little figure clad in white, ably supported by a still smaller figure,\r\nalso clad in white, but with an additional ruffle about the neck, both\r\nof them barefooted, appeared in the doorway.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Mollie!\" said Mrs. Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"We comed down to thee how you wath gettin' along,\" said the little\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we did,\" said the boy. \"But he didn't do a thing to me that day,\"\r\nhe added, climbing on his father's knee and snuggling down against his\r\nvest-pocket with a sweet little sigh of satisfaction. \"Did you, pa?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Thomas,\" said the Idiot. \"Don't you remember that I ignored you\r\nutterly?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'I'D RATHER BE SPANKED THAN NOT NOTICED AT ALL'\"]\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I do,\" said Tommy. \"But I'd rather be spanked than not noticed at\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid,\" said Mr. Pedagog a few hours later, as he and Mrs.\r\nPedagog were returning home, \"I am very much afraid that the Idiot's\r\nchildren are being spoiled.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope they are!\" returned the good lady, \"for really, John, I never\r\nknew a boy or a girl to grow into man or womanhood and amount to\r\nanything who hadn't been spoiled in childhood. Spoiling is another name\r\nfor the attitude of parents who make comrades of their children and who\r\ndo not set themselves up as tyrants--\"\r\n\r\n\"But the veneration of a child for his father and mother--\" Mr. Pedagog\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\n\"Should not degenerate into the awe which one feels for an unrelenting\r\ndespot!\" interrupted Mrs. Pedagog.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman discreetly retired from the field.\r\n\r\nAs for Mrs. and Mr. Idiot, they retired that night satisfied with the\r\nevening's diversion, and just before he turned out the light the Idiot\r\nwalked into the nursery to say good-night to the children.\r\n\r\n\"You're a good old pop!\" said Tommy, with an affectionate hug. \"_The\r\nbest I ever had!_\"\r\n\r\nAs for Mollie, she was sleeping soundly, with a smile on her placid\r\nlittle face which showed that, \"spoiled\" as she was, she was happy; and\r\nwhat should the Idiot or any one else seek to bring into a child's life\r\nbut happiness?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nIN THE LIBRARY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bibliomaniac had come off into the country to spend Sunday with the\r\nIdiot, and, as fortune would have it, Mr. and Mrs. Pedagog also appeared\r\non the scene. After the mid-day dinner the little party withdrew to the\r\nlibrary, where the Bibliomaniac began to discourse somewhat learnedly\r\nupon his hobby.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to see, my dear Idiot,\" he observed, as he glanced about the\r\nroom at the well-filled shelves, \"that as you grow older you are\r\ncultivating a love of good literature.\"\r\n\r\n\"I heartily echo the sentiment,\" said Mr. Pedagog, as he noted the\r\ntitles of some of the volumes. \"I may add that I am pleasurably\r\nsurprised at some of your selections. I never knew, for instance, that\r\nyou cared for Dryden, and yet I see here on the top shelf a voluminous\r\nedition of that poet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the Idiot. \"I have found Dryden very useful indeed.\r\nParticularly in that binding and in so many volumes. The color goes very\r\nwell with the hangings, and the space the books occupy, eked out by a\r\ndozen others of the same color, gives to that top shelf all the esthetic\r\neffect of an attractive and tasteful frieze. Then, too, it is always\r\nwell,\" he added, with a sly wink at Mrs. Idiot, \"to have a lot of books\r\nfor a top shelf that is difficult to reach that nothing under the canopy\r\ncould induce you to read. It is not healthful to be stretching upward,\r\nand with Dryden upon the top shelf my wife and I are never tempted to\r\nundermine our constitutions by taking him down.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bibliomaniac laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Your view is at least characteristic,\" said he, \"and to tell you the\r\nabsolute truth, I do not know that your judgment of the literary value\r\nof Dryden is at variance with my own. Somebody called him the Greatest\r\nPoet of a Little Age. Perhaps if the age had been bigger he'd not have\r\nshone so brilliantly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lowell,\" observed Mr. Pedagog, \"was responsible for that remark, if I\r\nremember rightly, and I have no doubt it is a just one, and yet I do not\r\nhold it up against Dryden. Man does not make the age. The age makes the\r\nman. Had there been any inspiring influences at work to give him a\r\nmotive, an incentive, Dryden might have been a greater poet. To excel\r\nhis fellows was all that could rightly be expected of him, and that he\r\ndid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Assuredly,\" said the Idiot. \"That has always been my view, and to-day\r\nwe benefit by it. If he had gone directly to oblivion, Mrs. Idiot and I\r\nshould have been utterly at a loss to know what to put on that top\r\nshelf.\"\r\n\r\nThe Idiot offered his visitors a cigar.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" said the Bibliomaniac, taking his and sniffing at it with\r\nall the airs and graces of a connoisseur.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'I DID NOT SMOKE UNTIL I WAS FIFTY'\"]\r\n\r\n\"I don't know but that I will join you,\" said Mr. Pedagog. \"I did not\r\nsmoke until I was fifty, and I suppose I ought not to have taken it up\r\nthen, but I did, and I have taken a great deal of comfort out of it. My\r\nallowance is fifty-two cigars a year, one for each Sunday afternoon,\" he\r\nadded, with a kindly smile.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you want to look out you don't get smoker's heart,\" said the\r\nIdiot. \"When a man plunges into a bad habit as rashly as that, he wants\r\nto pull up before it is too late.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have felt no ill effects since the first one,\" rejoined Mr. Pedagog.\r\n\"But you, my dear Idiot, how about your allowance? Is it still as great\r\nas ever? As I remember you in the old days you were something of a\r\ncigarette fiend.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'SMOKING KEEPS INSECTS FROM THE PLANTS'\"]\r\n\r\n\"I smoke just as much, but with this difference: I do not smoke for\r\npleasure any more, Mr. Pedagog,\" the Idiot replied. \"As a householder I\r\nsmoke from a sense of duty. It keeps moths out of the house, and insects\r\nfrom the plants.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THE BIBLIOMANIAC WAS INVESTIGATING THE CONTENTS OF THE\r\nLOWER SHELVES\"]\r\n\r\nThe Bibliomaniac meanwhile had been investigating the contents of the\r\nlower shelves.\r\n\r\n\"You've got a few rare things here, I see,\" he observed, taking up a\r\nvolume of short sketches illustrated by Leech, in color. \"This small\r\ntome is worth its weight in gold. Where did you pick it up?\"\r\n\r\n\"Auction,\" said the Idiot. \"I didn't buy it by weight, either. I bought\r\nit by mistake. The colored pictures fascinated me, and when it was\r\nput up I bawled out 'fifteen.' Another fellow said 'sixteen.' I wasn't\r\ngoing to split nickels so I bid 'twenty.' So we kept at it until it was\r\nrun up to 'thirty-six.' Then I thought I'd break the other fellow's\r\nheart by bidding fifty, and it was knocked down to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a stiff price, but on the whole it's worth it,\" said the\r\nBibliomaniac, stroking the back of the book caressingly.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Mr. Pedagog, \"if you bid on it consciously where did the\r\nmistake come in?\"\r\n\r\nThe Idiot sighed. \"I meant cents,\" he said, \"but the other chap and the\r\nauctioneer meant dollars. I went up and planked down a half-dollar and\r\nwas immediately made aware of my error.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you could have explained,\" said Mr. Pedagog.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'I PREFERRED TO PAY THE $49.50'\"]\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" said the Idiot, \"I _could_, but after all I preferred to pay\r\nthe extra $49.50 rather than make a public confession of such infernal\r\ninnocence before some sixty or seventy _habitues_ of a book-auction\r\nroom.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you were perfectly right!\" said the Bibliomaniac. \"You never would\r\nhave dared set your foot in that place again if you had explained. They\r\nwould have made life a burden to you. Furthermore, you have not paid too\r\ndearly for the experience. The book is worth forty dollars; and to learn\r\nbetter than to despise the man who makes his bid cautiously, and who\r\nadvances by small bids rather than by antelopian jumps, is worth many\r\ntimes ten dollars to the man who collects rare books seriously. In the\r\nearly days I scorned to break a five-dollar bill when I was bidding,\r\njust as you refused, as you put it, to split nickels, and many a time I\r\nhave paid as high as twenty-five dollars for books that could have been\r\nhad for twenty-one, because of that foolish sentiment.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have often wondered,\" Mr. Pedagog put in at this point, holding his\r\ncigar in a gingerly and awed fashion, taking a puff at it between words,\r\nby which symptoms the man who seldom smokes may always be identified, \"I\r\nhave often wondered what was the mission of a private library, anyhow.\r\nAnd now that I find you two gentlemen interested in a phase of\r\nbook-collecting with which I have had little sympathy myself, possibly I\r\nmay, without being offensive, ask a question. Do you, for instance,\r\nMr. Idiot, collect books because you wish to have something nobody else\r\nhas got, or do you buy your books to read?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a deep question,\" said the Idiot, \"and I do not know that I can\r\nanswer it off-hand. I have already confessed that I bought Dryden for\r\nhis decorative quality. I purchased my Thackeray to read. I bought my\r\nPepys Diary because I find it better reading than a Sunday newspaper,\r\nquite as gossipy, and with weather reports that are fully as reliable.\r\nBut that particular Leech I bought because of my youthful love for\r\ncolored pictures.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you admit that it is valuable because of its rarity, and that\r\ncompared to fifty dollars' worth of books that are not rare it is not to\r\nbe compared with them from a literary point of view?\" said Mr. Pedagog.\r\n\r\n\"I presume,\" said the Idiot, \"that the fifty dollars I expended on that\r\nbook would have provided me with a complete Shakespeare in one volume;\r\nall of Byron in green cloth and gold top; all of Dickens, Thackeray,\r\nBulwer, and Austen in six volumes, with a margin of forty-five dollars\r\nleft with which for nine years I could have paid for a subscription to\r\nthe Mercantile Library, containing all the good reading of the present\r\nday and all the standard works of the past. But I rather like to have\r\nthe books, and to feel that they are my own, even if it is only for the\r\npleasure of lending them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still, if a man collects books merely for their contents--\" persisted\r\nMr. Pedagog.\r\n\r\n\"He is a wild, extravagant person,\" said the Idiot. \"He might save\r\nhimself hundreds of dollars, not to say thousands. The library on that\r\nplan need not occupy an honored place among the rooms of the house. A\r\nmere pigeon-hole with a subscriber's card to a circulating library filed\r\naway in it will do as well, or if the city or town in which he lives\r\nmaintains a public library he may spare himself even that expense.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good for you!\" exclaimed the Bibliomaniac. \"That's the best answer to\r\nthe critics of book-collectors I have heard yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I agree with you,\" said Mr. Pedagog. \"It is a very comprehensive reply.\r\nAs for you, my dear Bibliomaniac, why do you collect books?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I love 'em as books,\" replied the Bibliomaniac. \"Because of\r\ntheir associations, and because when I get a treasure I have the bliss\r\nof knowing I have something that others haven't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it is selfishness?\" asked Mr. Pedagog.\r\n\r\n\"Just as everything else is,\" returned the Bibliomaniac. \"You, sir, if I\r\nmay be personal without wishing to be offensive, are wedded to Mrs.\r\nPedagog. You take pleasure in knowing that she belongs to you and not to\r\nany one else. The Idiot here is proud of his children, and is glad they\r\nare his children and nobody else's. _I_ am wedded to my rare books, and\r\nit rejoices my soul to pick up a volume that is unique, and to know that\r\nit belongs to me and to no one else. If that is selfishness, then all\r\npossession is selfish.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's about it,\" said the Idiot. \"You collect books just as Mormons\r\nand Solomon used to collect wives. You are called a Bibliomaniac. I\r\nsuppose Brigham Young and Solomon would have been known as\r\nGamyomaniacs--though I don't suppose that age in women as in books is a\r\nrequisite of value to marrying men--and they are both of them supposed\r\nto be rather canny persons.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Pedagog puffed away in silence. It was evident that the _argumentum\r\nad hominem_ did not please him.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said, after awhile, \"possibly you are right. If a man wants a\r\nlibrary to be a small British Museum--\"\r\n\r\n\"He will take better care of his rarities than the Idiot does,\" said the\r\nBibliomaniac, putting the rare Leech back into its place. \"If that were\r\nmine I'd put it out of the reach of my children.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't know you had any,\" said the Idiot, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you know what I mean,\" retorted the Bibliomaniac. \"You place Dryden\r\non the top shelf where Tommy and Mollie cannot get at him. But this\r\nbook, which is worth ten larger paper editions of Dryden, you keep\r\nbelow, where the children can easily reach it. It's a wonder to me\r\nyou've been able to keep it in its present superb condition.\"\r\n\r\n\"The mind of a child,\" said Mr. Pedagog, sententiously, \"is above\r\nvalues, above all conceits. It is the mind of sincerity, and a rare book\r\nhas no greater attraction to the boy or girl than one not so favored.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not my reason,\" said the Idiot. \"I know children pretty well,\r\nand I have observed that they are ambitious, and in a sense rebellious.\r\nThey want to do what they cannot do. That is why, when mothers place jam\r\non the top shelf of the pantry, the children always climb up to get it.\r\nIf they would leave it on the dining-room table, within easy reach, the\r\nchildren would soon cease to regard it as a thing to be sought for. Make\r\njam a required article of diet and the little ones will soon cease to\r\nwant it. So with that book. If I should put that out of Tommy's reach,\r\nTommy would lie awake nights to plan his campaign to get it. Leaving it\r\nwhere it is he doesn't think about it, doesn't want it, is not forbidden\r\nto have it, and so it escapes his notice.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have the right idea, the human idea,\" said Mr. Pedagog, and even\r\nthe Bibliomaniac was inclined to agree. But just then Tommy happened in,\r\nwith Mollie close after. The boy walked straight to the bookcase, and\r\nMollie gathered up the large shears from the Idiot's table, and together\r\nthey approached their father.\r\n\r\n\"Pa,\" said Mollie, holding up the scissors, \"can I borrow these?\"\r\n\r\n\"What for?\" asked the Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"We want to cut the pictures out o' this,\" said Tommy, holding up the\r\nfifty-dollar Leech.\r\n\r\nAfter all, it is difficult to lay down a cast-iron rule as to how a\r\nprivate library should be constructed or arranged, particularly when\r\none's loyalty is divided between one's children and one's merely bookish\r\ntreasures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nAS TO A SMALL DINNER\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THE COOK HAD TAKEN WINGS UNTO HERSELF\"]\r\n\r\nIt was sad but true. Mr. and Mrs. Idiot had invited Mr. Whitechoker and\r\nMr. and Mrs. Pedagog and the Poet to dinner, and for some reason or\r\nanother the cook had taken wings unto herself and flown, and the guests\r\nwere expected within two hours.\r\n\r\n\"I see now,\" said the Idiot, \"why they call it taking French leave.\r\nNobody who doesn't understand French understands it. If it wasn't\r\nFrench, or if somebody would translate it for us, we might be able to\r\ncomprehend it; as it is, it is one of the mysteries, and, as usual, we\r\nmust make the best of it. Life, after all, my dear, consists largely of\r\nmaking the best of things.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm sure I don't know what to do,\" said Mrs. Idiot, despairfully,\r\n\"unless you telegraph them all not to come, and tell them why.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is too late to do that,\" said the Idiot, looking at his watch.\r\n\"They've probably all left home by this time. Poets and clergymen and\r\nold people like Mr. and Mrs. Pedagog always do start an hour too early,\r\nfor fear of missing their train.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't care so much about the Poet,\" said Mrs. Idiot; \"he doesn't\r\nknow enough about housekeeping, anyhow, to make it matter. But Mr.\r\nWhitechoker and Mr. and Mrs. Pedagog--I simply can't ask them to camp\r\nout, as it were. The very fact that Mrs. Pedagog would become\r\nsympathetic immediately she learned what had happened would in itself be\r\nunbearable.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought women liked sympathy?\" said the Idiot, with a proper\r\nmanifestation of surprise.\r\n\r\n\"So they do; but you might just as well talk about claret as meaning one\r\nthing as of sympathy being all of the same brand,\" Mrs. Idiot answered.\r\n\"Certain kinds of claret are insufferable--sour and heady. I suppose\r\nthere are sixty different kinds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sixty-two,\" said the Idiot, blandly. \"The sixty you mean and two more\r\nwhose names I have forgotten.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you would be serious for a moment,\" Mrs. Idiot retorted, with as\r\nnear an approach to irritation as was possible to one of her amiable\r\ndisposition. \"And it's just the same way with sympathy,\" she continued;\r\n\"Mrs. Pedagog will lay this whole trouble to my inexperience. Probably\r\nshe never had a servant take French leave in her life on the eve of a\r\ndinner-party.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll bet she didn't,\" said the Idiot. \"And for why? Because she never\r\ngave a dinner-party in all her life. The habits of early life cling unto\r\nold age, and even as in her early days as a boarding-house keeper she\r\nnever gave anything, so now she doubtless considers giving a dinner as a\r\nreckless waste of opportunity. And she is quite right. Does a lawyer\r\ninvite his friends to join him in an opinion? Never. Does Mr. Tiffany\r\nrequest Mr. and Mrs. Idiot to accept a diamond tiara given in their\r\nhonor? Not. Does a true poet, with three names on his autograph, give a\r\npoem to anybody when he can sell it? Not if he knows it. Why, then,\r\nexpect a landlady, by birth and previous training, to _give_ a dinner?\"\r\n\r\n\"I notice,\" said Mrs. Idiot, severely, \"that you are always willing to\r\ngive your views!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'TWO BIG BOXES OF POTATOES, A CAN OF FRENCH PEASE, AND A\r\nBOTTLE OF SARSAPARILLA'\"]\r\n\r\n\"Precisely, my dear, and that proves my point,\" replied the Idiot,\r\namiably. \"I am not a professional viewer, and I am not a photographer by\r\ntrade. Therefore, why should I not _give_ my views? But really,\" he\r\nadded, \"I wouldn't bother; it'll all come out right. I don't know just\r\nhow, but I am confident we shall have the most glorious dinner of our\r\nlives. When I was down cellar this morning looking at the gas-meter I\r\nsaw two big boxes full of potatoes, a can of French pease, and a bottle\r\nof sarsaparilla, and if they don't like what they get it will be because\r\nthey are exacting. And I'll wager you from what I know of their manners\r\nthat if you gave them dried apples, cold tongue, and milk they'd say it\r\nwas the most delightful repast they ever sat down to.\"\r\n\r\n\"But _I'd_ know they didn't mean it,\" said Mrs. Idiot, smiling in spite\r\nof her woe.\r\n\r\n\"And that brings up the question, why should your conscience be\r\ntroubled by the insincerity of others?\" said he. \"Now, I'll tell you\r\nwhat we'll do. You fry the potatoes and I'll boil the can of pease; I\r\nthink four minutes will boil them hard, like an egg, and together we'll\r\nput the sarsaparilla on ice, and bluff the whole thing through. Bluffing\r\nwas always my strong point, and I have noticed, my dear, that in\r\nwhatever I have tried to do since we were married you have contributed\r\nat least ninety per cent. to success. My bluff plus your efforts to make\r\nthe thing a go will send our dinner to a premium.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Idiot remained properly silent. As a matter of fact, she was not\r\neven listening. She was considering. What on earth to do was the\r\nquestion in her mind, and it so entirely absorbed it that she\r\nfortunately had little left for the rather easy views of the Idiot\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\"What is a dinner, anyhow?\" the Idiot added, after the silence had to\r\nhis mind become oppressive. \"Is it a mere meal? Do the Poet and Mr. and\r\nMrs. Pedagog and Mr. Whitechoker come here merely to get something to\r\neat? Or do they come for the pleasure of our society, or for the\r\npleasure of leaving home, or what? As I understand it, people go out to\r\ndine not because they have not a sufficiency of food at home, but\r\nbecause they wish to meet other people. That's what I do. I can always\r\nhave something better to eat at home than I can get at somebody else's\r\nhouse; and furthermore, it is a more natural meal. Dinners generally are\r\nmade up of pretty little things that nobody likes, and have no\r\nsustenance in them. A successful dinner lies not in successful cooking,\r\nbut in pleasing conversation. Wherefore, it is not the cook, but the\r\nhost and hostess who make a failure or a success of a dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I presume if we simply spread the table and let you talk our\r\nguests will be satisfied?\" said Mrs. Idiot, blandly.\r\n\r\n\"Precisely,\" the Idiot replied. \"It will be delightful. Just think of\r\nthe menu! Instead of oysters I will indulge in a few opinions as to the\r\nintellectual qualities of bivalves generally, finishing up with a\r\nglowing tribute to the man who is content to be a clam and not talk too\r\nmuch. In the place of _purÃ©e_ we will tackle some such subject as the\r\nfuture of Spain. I think I could ladle out a few sound ideas on that\r\nsubject that would be as clear as the purest _consommÃ©_. Then for fish,\r\nthat would be easy. A good trout story, with imagination sauce, would do\r\nvery well. For the _entrÃ©e_ I will give you one of my most recent poems,\r\nand the roast will be--\"\r\n\r\n\"And the rest of us are to sit and twiddle our thumbs while you\r\nsoliloquize?\" demanded Mrs. Idiot. \"I rather think not. I will provide\r\nthe roast, my dear John, and it will consist largely of remarks upon the\r\nways of cooks.\"\r\n\r\n\"A very proper subject for a roast,\" observed the Idiot, complacently,\r\n\"and in your present frame of mind I think it will be not only well\r\ndone, but rare as well, with plenty of crisp. And so we can simply talk\r\nthis dinner through. It will be novel, certainly, and if you provide\r\nplenty of bread and butter no one need go away hungry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very true,\" Mrs. Idiot answered. \"And now that you have had your fun,\r\nsuppose we put our minds on the serious aspect of the case. Two hours\r\nfrom now four people are coming here hungry--\"\r\n\r\n\"I have it!\" cried the Idiot, delightedly. \"Let's _borrow_ a cook! I\r\ndon't believe it's ever been done before. It would be splendid, not\r\nonly in getting us out of our troubles, but in establishing an entirely\r\nnew principle in domestic science. What is the use of neighbors who will\r\nnot be neighborly and lend you their most cherished possession?\"\r\n\r\n\"None at all,\" sighed Mrs. Idiot, despairingly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'THE PEOPLE DOWN-STAIRS BORROWED OUR DINING-ROOM\r\nCHAIRS'\"]\r\n\r\n\"Now, when we lived in our flat in New York the people up-stairs\r\nborrowed our ice,\" said the Idiot; \"the people down-stairs borrowed our\r\ndining-room chairs; the people across the hall borrowed butter and milk\r\nand eggs, and I think we once borrowed a lemon from the people on the\r\ntop floor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never!\" cried Mrs. Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we did, my dear,\" insisted the Idiot. \"At least I did. You and the\r\nchildren were off in the country, and one hot summer's night, two years\r\nago, I was consumed with a desire for a glass of lemonade, and as there\r\nwere no lemons in the house, or the flat, I sent out to borrow. I began\r\nat the basement and worked up towards the roof, and ultimately got what\r\nI wanted, although, as I have said, it was the top-flat people I got it\r\nfrom.\"\r\n\r\n\"And did you ever return it?\" demanded Mrs. Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"I regret to say that I didn't,\" said the Idiot. \"But I will, and with\r\ninterest. I wonder what two years' interest on a lemon is!\" he added. \"I\r\nsuppose that a borrowed lemon compounded at the rate of six per cent.\r\ncould be paid off by a lemon and one small Bermuda potato. I will send\r\nmy check for both to those people to-morrow. What was their name?\"\r\n\r\n\"I never knew,\" said Mrs. Idiot. \"I never liked them, and I never\r\ncalled. I am sorry you are under obligations to them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only for a lemon, though, dear,\" said the Idiot, \"at six per cent.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what does all this prove?\" demanded the poor little housekeeper.\r\n\r\n\"That the principle of lending is recognized among neighbors,\" the Idiot\r\nexplained. \"If a neighbor will lend a lemon, surely a neighbor will lend\r\na cook. The principle involved is the same in both cases. Particularly\r\nso in this case, for my experience with cooks has been that they are,\r\nafter all, for the most part nothing but human lemons. If the departed\r\nBridget had been anything but full of sourness she would not have left\r\nus so unexpectedly.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't really think for a moment, do you, that the Jimpsonberrys\r\nwould lend us their cook, or that she would come, or that I would ask\r\nthem?\" said Mrs. Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I suppose not,\" said the Idiot. \"I suppose not. _But I don't see\r\nwhy!_ First, the Jimpsonberrys, as our neighbors, ought to be willing to\r\nget us out of our trouble. Second, we don't ask their cook to come for\r\nnothing. By coming she will receive an addition to her wages which will\r\nhelp her to endow a policeman with a moderate fortune some day when she\r\nmarries him. As for your asking Mrs. Jimpsonberry to lend us her cook\r\nfor a few hours, that is the main objection. When one borrows one must\r\ngive collateral, and it may be that it would embarrass you to offer Mike\r\nas security for the safe return of the Jimpsonberrys' cook. Anyhow, I\r\nsee weak points in my plan, and we'd better abandon it. If the\r\nJimpsonberrys' cook is the only available incendiary in the\r\nneighborhood, we'd better stop where we are. When we dined at\r\nJimpsonberrys' last week I went away feeling that Jimpsonberry ought to\r\ncollect fire insurance on that dinner. It wasn't cooked; it was a plain\r\ncase of arson.\"\r\n\r\nIt was at this precise moment, when poor Mrs. Idiot was beginning to\r\ndespair of getting any advice of value from her husband, that the\r\ntelephone-bell rang, and the Idiot rose up to answer the call.\r\n\r\n\"Hello!\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Hello, old man!\" he added. \"That you? Glad to see you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he continued, after a pause. \"Of course we expect you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seven o'clock sharp,\" he remarked, a moment later. \"You'll surely be\r\nhere?\" Then after a second pause, he added:\r\n\r\n\"Good! You can stay all night if you wish; we've plenty of room.\r\nGood-bye.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'WHO WAS IT?' ASKED MRS. IDIOT\"]\r\n\r\n\"Who was it?\" asked Mrs. Idiot, as the Idiot hung up the receiver of the\r\ntelephone.\r\n\r\n\"The Poet,\" replied the Idiot. \"He wanted to know at what hour dinner\r\nwas.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear!\" cried Mrs. Idiot. \"Why didn't you tell him the dinner isn't\r\nfor to-night, but to-morrow night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't need to, my dear,\" said the Idiot, lighting a cigarette. \"We've\r\nmade a slight mistake. You invited these people, it now appears, for the\r\ntwenty-ninth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said Mrs. Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"Well, my love,\" said the Idiot, with an affectionate glance, \"to-day is\r\nthe--ah--the twenty-eighth.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Idiot drew a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n\"My!\" she cried, \"what a blessing! I wonder how I got so mixed!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's economy, perhaps,\" suggested the Idiot. \"If you will insist on\r\nbuying out-of-date diaries and last year's calendars at bargain-counters\r\nbecause they are cheap, I don't really see how you can expect to keep up\r\nwith the times.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Idiot laughed heartily. Her relief of mind was unmistakable.\r\n\r\n\"What would you have done, John, if this had really been the night?\" she\r\nasked later.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" said the Idiot. \"I think I should have taken you to\r\nNew York to dinner, and bluffed our guests into believing they had come\r\nup on the wrong night. It is very easy for a host to put his guests in\r\nthe wrong if he wants to. I don't, but if I must, I must.\"\r\n\r\nAs it was, the family dinner that night was a great success in spite of\r\nthe absence of the cook, because Mrs. Idiot, who is an expert with the\r\nchafing-dish, found several odds and ends in the late cook's domains,\r\nwhich, under her expert manipulation, became dishes which the Idiot said\r\nafterwards \"remained long in the memory without proving too permanent a\r\ntax upon the digestion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nON THE MAINTENANCE OF AN ATTIC\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Idiot had been laid up for a week. That is to say, he was too\r\nindisposed to attend to business at his office, and the family physician\r\nthought it would be a good idea if his patient would be content to\r\nremain quietly indoors for a little while. To this the Idiot cheerfully\r\nconsented.\r\n\r\n\"If there is one thing that I can do to perfection,\" he said, \"it is\r\nresting. Some men are born leisurely, some achieve leisure, and some are\r\ndischarged by their employers. I belong to the first two classes. I can\r\nnever become one of the third class, because, being my own employer, I\r\nam naturally pleased with myself, and am not likely to dispense with my\r\nown services.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so he stayed at home, and for a week pottered about the house, as he\r\nput it, and he had a glorious time.\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do with yourself this morning, dear?\" asked Mrs.\r\nIdiot on the morning of the first day. \"I've got to go to market, and\r\nthere are one or two other little things to be attended to which will\r\nkeep me out for some hours. Do you think you can amuse yourself while I\r\nam out?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't know,\" said the Idiot. \"I can try. Of course, you know,\r\nmy dear, that I am a good deal of a baby yet. However, if you can trust\r\nme to stay all by my lonesome for two or three hours I'll try to behave.\r\nI promise not to take the piano apart, and I vow I won't steal any jam,\r\nand I sha'n't float hair-brushes in the bath-tub pretending that they\r\nare armored cruisers looking for Spaniards, and I'll try to be good, but\r\nI can't make any promises.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Idiot smiled, as an indulgent guardian should, and went forth. The\r\nIdiot stayed at home and enjoyed himself. What he did is perhaps best\r\nindicated by his remarks some time later at a Sunday-night tea at which\r\nMr. and Mrs. Pedagog, and Mr. Brief, the lawyer, were present.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Pedagog,\" said the Idiot, \"did you ever have an attic?\"\r\n\r\n\"A what?\" demanded the Schoolmaster, naturally somewhat nonplussed.\r\n\r\n\"An attic,\" said the Idiot. \"A favored spot wherein to potter, to root,\r\nto rummage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes,\" said Mrs. Pedagog, after a moment of deliberation. \"I have\r\nhad an attic, but it never seemed to me to be a particularly interesting\r\nspot. I've used it as a sort of store-room for things I didn't know what\r\nto do with.\"\r\n\r\n\"Useless things,\" suggested Mr. Pedagog.\r\n\r\n\"Entirely so,\" acquiesced the good lady.\r\n\r\n\"Then if they are useless, why keep them?\" queried the Idiot. \"Useless\r\nthings might better be thrown away than stored away even in an attic.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, as for that,\" rejoined Mrs. Pedagog, \"they were useless in the\r\nsense that there was nothing I could do with them, and yet there was\r\ngenerally some quality of association or something about them that so\r\nappealed to me that I couldn't quite throw them away, or even bring\r\nmyself to give them away.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the idea,\" said the Idiot. \"One's cherished possessions are\r\noften stored away up-stairs and forgotten, and then sometimes years\r\nafter you'll go rummaging about the house for lack of some other\r\nemployment; an old trunk, a wooden box, will be unearthed in the attic,\r\nand then what a flood of memories will come rushing back over you as the\r\nlong-forgotten objects come to light, one by one.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have had much the same experience,\" said Mr. Brief, \"in what I might\r\nterm my professional attic. We keep a room for the storage of old\r\npapers, and strange exhibits in litigation turn up there frequently that\r\nbring back old-time lawsuits in a most interesting fashion.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose, then,\" observed Mr. Pedagog, with a shrug of tolerant\r\ncontempt, \"that the attic is, in your estimation, a sort of repository\r\nfor family archives.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'I SET OFF A GIANT CRACKER UNDER HIS CHAIR'\"]\r\n\r\n\"That's about it,\" said the Idiot. \"You ought to see mine. There are\r\narchives from the Ark in mine. I've got all the portraits of my\r\nunpopular relatives up there, and such a gallery of smug-looking\r\nindividuals you never saw. There's Uncle Jedediah, who hated me because\r\nI set off a giant cracker under his chair one Fourth of July, and who\r\nfrom that day vowed I was born to be hanged; and who sent me a crayon\r\nportrait of himself the following Christmas--\"\r\n\r\n\"That seems to me to show a kindly feeling, not one of hatred, towards\r\nyou,\" suggested Mrs. Pedagog.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'WOULD HANG THAT PORTRAIT UPON THE WALL OF MY BEDROOM'\"]\r\n\r\n\"Oh no,\" said the Idiot, with a laugh. \"You never knew my dear old Uncle\r\nJed. He sent it in a pure spirit of revenge. He had to send something,\r\nand he picked out the one thing he had reason to know I didn't want; and\r\nhe was likewise aware that my mother had a sense of the proprieties and\r\nwould hang that portrait upon the wall of my bedroom, whence it could\r\nstare at me, disapprovingly, forevermore. Still, when I became the head\r\nof my own house, I did not take a mean-spirited revenge on Uncle\r\nJedediah's portrait by selling it to one of the comic papers with a joke\r\nunder it; I gave it the nicest, warmest, most comfortable spot I could\r\nfind for it under a pile of old magazines in the attic, and the other\r\nday when it came to light again I greeted it with an affectionate smile;\r\nand the picture of the old gentleman rising hurriedly from over the\r\ngiant cracker on that long-forgotten Fourth, brought vividly to mind by\r\nthe portrait, brought tears to my eyes, I laughed so heartily. It\r\nreally was very affecting.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Pedagog gazed at the Idiot fondly.\r\n\r\n\"You are a great boy,\" he said. \"You'd never suspect it, but I had a\r\nsimilar case of Uncle Jed, but the years I have lived since have\r\nsoftened my feelings so that I remember my old relative with a certain\r\ndegree of affection.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall never believe, my dear John,\" said Mrs. Pedagog, \"that in your\r\nday boys ever placed giant crackers under their uncles' chairs.\"\r\n\r\n\"We never did, my love,\" Mr. Pedagog responded, quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Why, of course not,\" laughed the Idiot. \"They couldn't, you know. They\r\nhadn't been invented. What was your trouble with Uncle Jed, Mr.\r\nPedagog?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, our difference of opinion was rather of an ethical import,\" replied\r\nMr. Pedagog, genially. \"My Uncle Jed was a preacher, and he used to\r\nspeak entirely from notes which he would make out the night before and\r\nplace in the pocket of his black coat. All I did was to take the notes\r\nof his next day's sermon out of his pocket one Saturday evening, and put\r\nin their stead a--ah--a recipe for what we called Washington pie--and a\r\nvery good pie it was.\"\r\n\r\n\"John!\" ejaculated Mrs. Pedagog.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'STARTED TO PREACH WITH THE RECIPE FOR A WASHINGTON\r\nPIE'\"]\r\n\r\n\"I _did_, my dear,\" confessed the Schoolmaster, \"and really I have never\r\nregretted it, although my particular uncle gave me a distressingly acrid\r\nand dreary lecture on my certain future when he found out what had\r\nhappened. Yet what did happen, though mischievously intended, resulted\r\nin great good, for when the dear old gentleman stood up in the pulpit\r\nand started to preach the next morning, with the recipe for a Washington\r\npie as the only available note at hand, he pulled himself together and\r\npreached off-hand the finest sermon of his life, and he discovered then\r\nthe secret of his after-success. He became known ultimately as one of\r\nthe most brilliant preachers of his time, and from that moment never\r\nwent into the pulpit with any factitious aids to his memory.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean cribs, don't you?\" asked the Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"That is what college-boys call them, I believe,\" said Mr. Pedagog. \"I\r\nwill say further that a year before he died _my_ Uncle Jed told me that\r\nit was my mischievous act that had given him the hint which became\r\nthe keynote of his eloquence,\" he added, complacently. \"I shall always\r\nremember him affectionately.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said the Idiot. \"No doubt we all remember our Uncle Jeds\r\naffectionately. I certainly do. He was my mother's brother, and he meant\r\nwell. I never really blamed him for not knowing how to sympathize with a\r\nboyish prank, because there has never been a school of instructions for\r\nuncles. Unclehood is about the hardest hood man has to wear, and as I\r\nhave observed uncles and their habits, they either spoil or repel the\r\nsmall chaps and chappesses who happen to be made their nephews and\r\nnieces by an accident of birth. Uncles are either intensely genial or\r\nintensely irritable, and as far as I am concerned it is my belief that\r\nour colleges should include in their curriculum a chair of 'Uncleism.'\r\nUnclehood is a relationship that man has to accept. It is thrust upon\r\nhim. He can't help himself. To be a father or a mother is a matter of\r\nvolition. But even in a free country like our own, if a man has a\r\nbrother or a sister he is liable to find himself an uncle at any time\r\nwhether he wishes to be one or not. Then when it happens he's got to\r\nreason out a course of procedure without any basis in previous\r\nexperience.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you write a book on 'Hints to Uncles,' or 'The Complete\r\nAunt,'\" suggested Mr. Brief. \"I have no doubt it would make good\r\nreading.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks for the idea,\" said the Idiot. \"I think I'll do it. Not in the\r\nhope of profit, but for the benefit of the race.\"\r\n\r\n\"What has all this to do with attics?\" asked Mrs. Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"The natural resting-place of the bad uncle,\" explained the Idiot.\r\n\"Still, I maintain that it is every man's duty to keep an attic for the\r\nuseless things, as Mrs. Pedagog calls them, which some day, when he\r\nleast expects it, will carry his mind back to other days. The word\r\nitself, attic, carries the mind back to the splendors of Athens and\r\nother things that are out of date. When I was ill I found sincerest\r\npleasure in rummaging. You can't rummage in a library if your library is\r\nproperly looked after. You can't rummage in a bedroom in a well-kept\r\nhouse. You all know what parlors are--designed largely for the\r\nreception of people who come out to call upon you in their best Sunday\r\nclothes, and who would never think of calling upon you intimately, as a\r\nfriend might, in his knickerbockers. You can't rummage there. The only\r\nplace where one may rummage with any degree of success is in the attic,\r\nand my experience has been such that I believe my recent illness has\r\ncontributed to my health. My mind has been carried back to conditions\r\nthat used to be. Conditions which existed then and which were inferior\r\nto conditions which now prevail make me satisfied with the present.\r\nWhere old-time conditions were better than the existing one I have\r\nnaturally discovered how to improve. Rummaging, therefore, is improving\r\nto the mind and contributes to one's contentment.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'A LITTLE BUNDLE OF MY OWN LETTERS'\"]\r\n\r\n\"Then there are good economical reasons for the maintenance of an\r\nattic,\" the Idiot continued. \"I found enough old boyhood collections of\r\nvarious things there to keep Tommy and Mollie happy for years without my\r\nhaving to pay out a penny for birthday presents--old stamps, old coins,\r\nold picture papers, and, I assure you, a lot of old newspapers, too,\r\nwith better and more readable news in them than is now to be found in\r\nany of our modern bilious journals. Then the bundles of letters that\r\ncame out of that place--my mother's letters to me, written while I was\r\naway at school; my father's letters in the old days at your house, Mrs.\r\nPedagog, which did much to keep me straight then and re-reading of which\r\ndoesn't hurt now; and, best of all,\" he added, with an affectionate\r\nglance at Mrs. Idiot, \"a little bundle of my own letters to a certain\r\nperson tied up with a blue ribbon, and full of pressed roses and autumn\r\nleaves and promises--\"\r\n\r\n\"In the attic?\" asked Mr. Brief, with a dry smile. \"Is that where Mrs.\r\nIdiot keeps your promises?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Idiot blushed. \"I have a cedar chest full of treasures up there,\"\r\nshe said. \"I thought it was locked.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, anyhow, I found them,\" said the Idiot, cheerfully; \"and while\r\nthey were not especially good reading, they were good reminders of other\r\ndays. It wouldn't be a bad idea if every married man were to read over\r\nthe letters of his days of courtship once a year. I think it would bring\r\nback more forcibly than anything else the conditions of the contract\r\nwhich he was inviting the young partner of his joys to sign. If an attic\r\nnever held anything but bundles of one's old love-letters it would\r\ndemonstrate its right to become an institution.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very true,\" said the lawyer; \"but,\" he added, prompted by that cautious\r\nspirit which goes always with the professional giver of advice, \"suppose\r\nthat side by side with that little bundle of pressed flowers and autumn\r\nleaves and promises one should chance to find another little bundle of\r\npressed flowers and autumn leaves and promises--the promises written by\r\nsome other hand than the hand that is rummaging in the cedar chest? What\r\nthen? Would that prove a pleasing find?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, as for that,\" the Idiot remarked, \"when I advocate the maintenance\r\nof an attic as one of the first duties of mankind, I mean its\r\nintelligent maintenance. The thing which makes of the British Museum,\r\nthe National Attic of Great Britain, a positive educational force is its\r\nintelligent direction. It is the storehouse of the useless possessions\r\nof the British Empire which have an inspiring quality. There is nothing\r\nin it which makes a Briton think less of himself or which in any way\r\nunpleasantly disturbs his equanimity. So with the attic of the humble\r\ncitizen. It must be intelligently directed if it is to become an\r\ninstitution, and should not be made the repository of useless things\r\nwhich ought to be destroyed, among which I class that other possible\r\nbundle to which you refer.\"\r\n\r\nAnd inasmuch as the whole party agreed to the validity of this\r\nproposition, the subject was dropped, and the Idiot and his guests\r\nwandered on to other things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nTHE IDIOT'S GARDEN\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I should think, my dear Idiot,\" Mr. Pedagog observed one summer\r\nevening, as his host stood upon the back piazza of \"Castle Idiot,\" as\r\nthey had come to call the dwelling-place of their friend, \"that with all\r\nthis space you have about you, you would devote some of it to a garden.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, I do,\" said the Idiot. \"I've got a small patch down there behind\r\nthe tennis-court, fifty by one hundred feet, under cultivation. The\r\nstuff we get is almost as good as the average canned goods, too. We had\r\na stalk of asparagus the other night that was magnificent as far as it\r\nwent. It was edible for quite a sixteenth of an inch, or at least I was\r\ntold so. That portion of it had already been nibbled off by my son\r\nThomas while it was resting in the pantry waiting to be served.\r\nHowever, the inedible end which arrived was quite sturdy, and might have\r\nstood between my family and starvation if the necessity had arisen.\"\r\n\r\n\"One stalk of asparagus is a pretty poor crop, I should say,\" observed\r\nthe lawyer, with a laugh.\r\n\r\n\"You might think so,\" said the Idiot. \"But everything in the world is\r\ncomparative, after all. Ants build ant-hills which are several feet\r\nlower than the Alps, and yet they are monumental, considering that they\r\nwere made by ants. All things considered, Mrs. Idiot and I were proud of\r\nour asparagus crop, and distinctly regretted that it did not survive to\r\nbe served in proper state at dinner. If I remember rightly, Thomas was\r\nseverely reprimanded for his privateering act in biting off the green\r\nend of it before I had a chance to see it.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Twasn't specially good,\" said Tommy, loftily.\r\n\r\n\"I am very glad it was not, my son,\" said the Idiot. \"I should be very\r\nsorry to hear that you had derived the slightest sensation of pleasure\r\nfrom your piratical and utterly inexcusable act.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you usually serve so small a portion of the product of your\r\ngarden?\" asked Mr. Brief.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'WE SPRINKLED IT IN PERSON'\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'HE DISCOVERED THE ONE PERFECT STALK'\"]\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes we don't serve anything at all from it,\" said the Idiot,\r\n\"which you will observe is smaller yet. In this instance Mrs. Idiot\r\nintended a little surprise for me. We had struggled with that\r\nasparagus-bed for some time. The madame had studied up asparagus in her\r\nbotany. I had looked it up in the cyclopedia and the Century dictionary.\r\nWe had ordered it in various styles when we dined out at the New York\r\nhotels, and we had frequently bought cans of it in order to familiarize\r\nourselves more intimately with its general personal appearance. Then we\r\nconsulted people we thought would be likely to know how to obtain the\r\nbest results, and what they told us to do we did, but somehow it didn't\r\nwork. Our asparagus crop languished. We sprinkled it in person. We put\r\nall sorts of garden cosmetics on it to improve its complexion, but it\r\nseemed hopeless, and finally when I footed up the asparagus item in my\r\naccount-book, and discovered that we had paid out enough money without\r\nresults of a satisfactory nature to have kept us in canned asparagus for\r\nfour years, we got discouraged, and resolved to give it up. It was\r\nwhile Michael, our gardener, was removing the evidences of our failure\r\nthat he discovered the one perfect stalk, and like the honest old\r\ngardener that he is, he immediately brought it into the house and\r\npresented it to my wife. She naturally rejoiced that our efforts had not\r\nbeen entirely vain, and in her usual spirit of self-sacrifice had the\r\nstalk cooked as a surprise for me. As I have told you, that small\r\ncircumstance Thomas, over which we seem to have no control, got ahead of\r\nus--\"\r\n\r\n\"You was surprised, wasn't you, pa?\" demanded the boy.\r\n\r\n\"Somewhat, my son,\" said the Idiot, \"but not in the way your mother had\r\ndesigned, exactly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is asparagus the extent of your gardening?\" queried Mrs. Pedagog.\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, indeed!\" replied Mrs. Idiot. \"We've had peas and beets and beans\r\nand egg-plant and corn--almost everything, in fact, including potatoes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" said the Idiot, \"almost everything, including potatoes.\r\nOur pea crop was lovely. We had five podfuls for dinner on the Fourth of\r\nJuly, and the children celebrated the day by podding them for the\r\ncook. They popped open almost as noisily as a torpedo. It was really\r\nvery enjoyable. Indeed, one of the results of that pea crop has been to\r\ngive me an idea by which I may some day redeem my losses on the\r\nasparagus-bed. An explosive pea which should be edible, and yet would\r\npop open with the noise of a small fire-cracker, would be a delight to\r\nthe children and serviceable for the table. I don't exactly know how to\r\nbring about the desired results, but it seems to me if I were to mix a\r\nlittle saltpetre in the water with which we irrigate our pea-trees the\r\nrequired snap would be obtained. Then on the Fourth of July the\r\nchildren, instead of burning their fingers and filling their parents\r\nwith nervous dread setting off fire-crackers, could sit out on the back\r\npiazza and shell the peas for the cook--\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd rather shell Spangyards,\" said Mollie.\r\n\r\n\"I am surprised at you, my child,\" said the Idiot. \"A little girl like\r\nyou should be an advocate of peace, not of war.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't eat Spaniards, either, can you, pa?\" said Tommy, who, while\r\nhe shared Mollie's views as to the comparative value for shelling\r\npurposes of peas and Spaniards, was nevertheless quite interested in the\r\ndevelopment of a pea-pod that would open with a bang.\r\n\r\n\"No, Tommy,\" said the Idiot, \"you can't eat Spaniards, and they'd be\r\nsure to disagree with you if you could.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a very interesting proposition of yours,\" said Mr. Brief, \"but\r\nit has its dangers. A dynamite pea would prove very attractive so long\r\nas its explosive qualities were confined to the pod and its opening. But\r\nhow are you going to keep the saltpetre out of the peas themselves?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is where the difficulty comes in,\" said the Idiot. \"I frankly\r\ndon't know how we could insulate the peas from the effects of the\r\nsaltpetre.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'IT WOULD BE DEUCEDLY AWKWARD ... IF THEY WOULD EXPLODE\r\nIN THE MOUTH OF THE PERSON WHO WAS EATING THEM'\"]\r\n\r\n\"It would be deucedly awkward,\" observed the Bibliomaniac, \"if, as might\r\nvery well happen, one or two of the peas should become so thoroughly\r\nimpregnated with the stuff that they would explode in the mouth of the\r\nperson who was eating them, like bombs in miniature.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'SHE COULD SLAM THEM DOWN ON THE HEARTH-STONES LIKE\r\nTORPEDOES'\"]\r\n\r\n\"True,\" said the Idiot. \"The only safeguard against that would be to\r\ncompel the cook to test every pea before she cooked it. She could\r\nslam them down on the hearth-stone like torpedoes, and every one that\r\ndidn't go off could be cooked and served with safety. Still, there would\r\nbe danger even then. A careless cook might forever ruin the tooth of a\r\nfavored guest. I guess I'd better give up the idea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't, pa!\" cried Tommy, his interest in explosive vegetables\r\nworked up to a high pitch. \"I'll test 'em all for you, and if they work\r\nI don't see why you couldn't raise dynamite punkins!\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be a strong temptation, my son,\" said the Idiot, \"which is all\r\nthe more reason why I should abandon the plan. A dynamite punkin, as you\r\ncall it, would wreck the whole neighborhood if one should set it off\r\nproperly. No, we will, after all, confine our attention to vegetables of\r\na more pacific nature. The others might prove more profitable at first,\r\nbut when the novelty of them wore off, and one realized only their\r\ndanger, a great deal of the pleasure one derives from eating fresh\r\nvegetables would be utterly destroyed.\"\r\n\r\nTommy looked out over the railing of the piazza, deep regret and\r\ndisappointment depicted in his brown little face; but if the glitter of\r\nhis eyes meant anything it meant that the idea of putting vegetables on\r\na war footing was not going to be allowed to drop into oblivion; and if\r\nthe small youth progresses in inventive genius in a fair ratio to his\r\npast achievements in that line, I have no doubt that if a Vesuvian\r\npumpkin _can_ be produced at all, the day will dawn when Thomas is\r\nhailed as its inventor.\r\n\r\n\"Is it true,\" asked Mr. Brief, \"that home-raised peas are sweeter than\r\nany other?\"\r\n\r\n\"We think so,\" said Mrs. Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"We know so,\" amended the Idiot. \"That Fourth-of-July night when we ate\r\nthose five podfuls we discovered that fact. Five podfuls of peas are not\r\nenough to feed a family of four on, so we mixed them in with a few more\r\nthat we bought at the grocer's, and we could tell ours from the others\r\nevery time, they were so much sweeter.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bibliomaniac laughed scornfully.\r\n\r\n\"Pooh!\" said he. \"How did you know that they were yours that were sweet,\r\nand not the grocery-bought peas?\"\r\n\r\n\"How does a father know his own children?\" said the Idiot. \"If you'd\r\nlabored over those five pods as hard and assiduously as we did, nursing\r\nthem through their infant troubles, guarding them against locusts and\r\npotato-bugs, carefully watching their development from infancy into the\r\nfull vigor of a mature peahood, I guess you'd know your own from those\r\nof others. It's instinct, my dear Bibliomaniac.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell about the strawberry, pa,\" said Tommy, who liked to hear his\r\nfather talk, in which respect I fear he takes strongly after his parent.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the Idiot, \"it's not much of a story. There was one. We had\r\na strawberry patch twenty feet by ten. We had plenty of straw and plenty\r\nof patch, but the berries were timid about appearing. The results were\r\nsimilar to those in our asparagus venture. One berry was discovered\r\ntrying to hide itself under half a bale of straw one morning, and while\r\nI was looking for Mrs. Idiot, to ask her to come down to the garden and\r\nsee it grow, a miserable robin came along and bit its whole interior\r\nout. I hope the bird enjoyed it, because on a bed-rock estimate that\r\nberry cost twenty dollars. That is one of the things about gardening\r\nthat make me especially weary. One doesn't mind spending forty-four\r\ndollars on a stalk of asparagus that is eaten, even surreptitiously, by\r\na member of one's own family; but to pay twenty dollars for a strawberry\r\nto be wasted on a fifteen-cent robin is, to say the least, irritating.\"\r\n\r\n\"You forget, John,\" said Mrs. Idiot, with a somewhat mirthful look in\r\nher eyes, \"that we got fifteen boxes out of the strawberry-patch later.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't,\" said the Idiot. \"I was coming to that, and it involves a\r\nconfession. You were so blue about the loss of our one beautiful berry\r\nthat I entered into a conspiracy with Michael to make that patch yield.\r\nThe fifteen boxes of berries that we took out subsequently were bought\r\nat a New York fruit-store and judiciously scattered about the patch\r\nwhere you would find them. I had hoped you would never find it out, but\r\nwhen you spoke the other day of expending thirty-eight dollars on that\r\nstrawberry-patch next year, I resolved then to undeceive you. This is\r\nthe first favorable opportunity I have had.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Idiot laughed heartily. \"I knew it all along,\" she said. \"Michael\r\ncame to me with them and asked for instructions as to where to put them.\r\nReally, I--ah--I arranged them under the straw myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"What an ass a hired man can be!\" ejaculated the Idiot. \"I shall\r\ndischarge Michael to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you would,\" said Mrs. Idiot. \"Ever since the conspiracy he has\r\nbeen entirely too independent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't discharge Michael, papa,\" said Mollie. \"He's awful nice. He's\r\nalways willin' to stop anything he's doing to play with Tommy and me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You bet he is!\" cried Tommy. \"He's a dandy, Mike is. He never says a\r\nword when I sit under the sprinkler, and he told me the other day that\r\nhis grandfather would have been king of Ireland if Queen Victoria hadn't\r\ncome in. He said the Queen was a lady, and his grandfather gave up his\r\nseat to her because he was a gentleman and couldn't do anything else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said the Idiot, suavely. \"Then I won't discharge Michael.\r\nOne feels a better American, a better Republican, if he has a royal\r\npersonage in his employ. I always wondered where Michael got his\r\nimperious manner; now I know. As a descendant of a long line of kings it\r\ncould not be otherwise. I will give him another chance. But let me give\r\nyou all fair warning. If next summer Michael does not succeed in\r\nproducing from my garden four beets, ten pods of peas, three\r\nstring-beans, and less than ten thousand onions, he goes. I shall not\r\npay a gardener forty dollars a month unless he can raise three dollars'\r\nworth of vegetables a year.\"\r\n\r\n\"But really,\" said Mr. Pedagog, \"haven't you raised anything in your\r\ngarden?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes,\" said the Idiot. \"I've raised my water bill in the garden. I\r\nused to pay twelve dollars a quarter for water, but now the bills come\r\nto at least twenty-five dollars. Truly, a garden is not without profit\r\nto some one.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nHOUSEHOLD POETRY\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the Idiot, in response to an inquiry from the Poet, who was\r\npassing a Sunday with him at Castle Idiot, \"I have found that there is a\r\ngreat deal of poetry in the apparently uninspiring little things of a\r\nhousehold. There is to me as much poetry in a poker as there is in a\r\nsnow-clad Alp, if you only have an eye to find it; and I am sure that to\r\nthousands of housewives the whole land over a sonnet to a clothes-pin,\r\nwritten by one who knows the clothes-pin's nature intimately, would be\r\nfar more appealing than a similar number of lines trying to prove that\r\nwe are all miserable phantoms flitting across a morass of woe.\"\r\n\r\nThe Poet pulled away thoughtfully at his pipe. He was a broad-minded\r\npoet, and while he had never owned a poker of his own, he was ready to\r\nadmit its possibilities; but he could not follow his friend closely\r\nenough to admit that it contained as much that was inspiring as did Mont\r\nBlanc, for instance, a bright particular Alp of which he was very fond.\r\n\r\nThe Idiot continued:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'THE JOYS AND WOES OF THE TOILERS WHO MINED IT'\"]\r\n\r\n\"A ton of coal contains far more warmth than a woman's eyebrow; sends\r\nthe mind of a thoughtful person chasing backward to the time when it lay\r\nsnugly hid in the fair breast of nature; to the joys and woes of the\r\ntoilers who mined it; through a variety of complexities of life, every\r\none of them fraught with noble thoughts. Yet who ever wrote dainty\r\nverses to a ton of coal, and who hasn't at one time or another in his\r\nlife written about the eyebrows of some woman?\"\r\n\r\nThe Poet laughed this time. \"A triolet to a ton of coal would be a\r\nglorious thing now, wouldn't it?\" he observed.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the Idiot. \"A triolet could never be a glorious thing under\r\nany circumstances; but to the extent that a ton of coal contains a\r\ncertain amount of grandeur in the service it renders to mankind, I think\r\nthe form would be ennobled somewhat by the substance. Let's try it and\r\nsee.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do it,\" said the Poet; \"I really don't think I could do the\r\nsubject justice.\"\r\n\r\nThe Idiot got out a pencil and a pad of paper and began.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I'll make it a triolet,\" he said, after biting the end of\r\nhis pencil for a few moments. \"A whole ton is a good deal to cram into a\r\ntriolet. I'll just make it a plain poem of the go-as-you-please variety\r\ninstead, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the manner of Whitman, perhaps?\" suggested the Poet, dryly.\r\n\r\n\"Just so,\" said the Idiot. \"In the manner of Whitman; in fact, I think\r\nthe manner of Whitman is the only manner for the poetic description of a\r\nton of coal.\"\r\n\r\nHe began to scribble on the pad.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to call this 'Content,'\" he said in a few moments.\r\n\"Contentment strikes me as the main lesson a ton of coal teaches.\"\r\n\r\nHe scribbled on, and in four or five minutes he put down his pencil and\r\nread the following lines:\r\n\r\n  \"I'm glad I'm not as men are--\r\n  Always worrying about something, and often about nothing;\r\n  About what was and what wasn't;\r\n  Fretting about what may be and what might have been;\r\n  Wondering whether when they are called upon to do their duty\r\n  They'll be able to do it,\r\n  And generally deciding they won't,\r\n  To their own discomfort.\r\n  And if so be they're women,\r\n  Cogitating from morn till night,\r\n  From night till morn,\r\n  Wherewithal shall they be clothed,\r\n  And if their hats are on straight!\r\n  Yea!\r\n  I am glad I am not like one of these,\r\n  But am myself--\r\n  A ton of coal--jetty in my blackness and luminous in my bituminosity.\r\n  Lying here in the cellar content and not bothering a bit.\r\n  Not needing income or clothes, and wearing no hat, and with no\r\n      complexion to bother about.\r\n  Happy and serene about my duty,\r\n  Certain that I shall succeed when the time for action comes;\r\n  Knowing that I shall burn,\r\n  And in the burning glow like the polar star.\r\n  Cackling and crackling,\r\n  Hissing and smoking,\r\n  Full of heat,\r\n  A satisfaction to mankind,\r\n  And never worth less than $5.65, delivered!\r\n  Ah, me! What bliss to be a ton of coal!\r\n  I am content.\"\r\n\r\nThe Poet nodded his pleasure at the effort. \"It is charmingly put,\" he\r\nsaid. \"I must confess, my dear Idiot, that the idea of contentment is\r\nthe last one that I should ever have extracted from contemplation of\r\na binful of anthracite, and yet when I consider how you put it I wonder\r\nit has not occurred to every one. You have the manner of the Whitman\r\nparodist down fine, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" said the Idiot. \"It is entirely natural to me. I think,\r\ntoo, that using the Whitman lack of form carries with it the notion of\r\nthe coal sliding down the chute, don't you? Coal runs into the cellar in\r\nsuch an irresponsible, formless way, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely,\" smiled the Poet. \"You have the right notion about that. The\r\nform of a poem should really be adapted to the substance. It should be\r\ndescriptive, always. Tennyson's 'Charge of the Light Brigade' has in its\r\nrhythm nothing more or less than the clatter of the horses' hoofs as\r\nthey and their riders dashed through the valley of death at Balaklava.\r\nAnd how vividly Southey's brook comes before the mind in its mad rush\r\ndownward as one reads that wonderfully lyrical poem. Why don't you write\r\na book of household poetry? You seem to me to be eminently well\r\nqualified to undertake it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I intend to,\" said the Idiot. \"In fact, I've begun it already. Written\r\nfive or six. Like to see 'em?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed I should,\" said the Poet. \"Anything you do interests me.\"\r\n\r\nThe Idiot went to his desk and took from it a few pages of manuscript.\r\n\r\n\"Here is a thing on pokers I did the other night. I called it 'The Song\r\nof the Poker Bold.'\" And then he read these lines:\r\n\r\n  \"Warder of the grate am I,\r\n    Ever standing near;\r\n  Poking, poking all day long,\r\n    Knowing naught of fear.\r\n\r\n  \"Keeping coals up to their work,\r\n    Setting them aglow,\r\n  Minding not the scorching heat,\r\n    Rather like it so.\r\n\r\n  \"Knocking ashes right and left,\r\n    Flirting with the tiles;\r\n  Bossing tongs and seeing that\r\n    The brazen kettle biles.\r\n\r\n  \"And the little girls and boys\r\n    As they watch me pause,\r\n  Wishing that I'd talk and tell\r\n    'Bout old Santa Claus!\r\n\r\n  \"Cracking jokes with crickets on\r\n    The merry hearth, elate;\r\n  Happy lot indeed is mine--\r\n    Warder of the grate!\"\r\n\r\n\"Splendid!\" cried the Poet, clapping his hands with enthusiasm.\r\n\"Splendid! A good stiff pokeresque lyric, and your characterization of\r\nthe poker as the 'Warder of the Grate' gives it a flavor of romance. You\r\ncould almost imagine the implement going out into a mediÃ¦val world in\r\nsearch of knightly adventure--a sort of hearth-stone Quixote. Have you\r\ntackled the clothes-pin yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied the Idiot. \"Indeed, my first effort was a lyric on the\r\nclothes-pin. I started one night to do the contents of the\r\nkitchen-dresser drawer in French forms, but the first thing I took out\r\nwas an egg-beater, and it wouldn't go, so I did the clothes-pin lyric. I\r\ncall it\r\n\r\n\"FIDELITY\r\n\r\n  \"Blow, ye winds,\r\n    I fear ye not;\r\n  Blast, ye simoon,\r\n    Sere and hot!\r\n\r\n  \"Hurricane,\r\n    And cyclone, too,\r\n  Blow, I have no\r\n    Fear of you.\r\n\r\n  \"Lacking beauty,\r\n    Lacking grace,\r\n  Lacking handsome\r\n    Form and face;\r\n\r\n  \"Lacking soul\r\n    And intellect,\r\n  Still I stand up,\r\n    Proud, erect.\r\n\r\n  \"For the Fates\r\n    Have given me\r\n  Wondrous great\r\n    Tenacity.\r\n\r\n  \"And success,\r\n    Both fair and fine,\r\n  Comes to him\r\n    Who holds his line.\r\n\r\n  \"Burrs can stick\r\n    And so can glue--\r\n  Mucilage,\r\n    Stratena, too;\r\n\r\n  \"But there's nothing\r\n    Holds so fast\r\n  As the clothes-pin\r\n    To the last.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you gave up the egg-beater altogether?\" asked the Poet, restraining\r\na natural inclination to find flaws in the construction of the\r\nclothes-pin poem.\r\n\r\n\"Oh no,\" said the Idiot, \"I knocked off a little quatrain on that. I\r\ncalled it 'The Speedy Egg-Beater,' and it goes like this:\r\n\r\n  \"Great Maude S. can beat all steeds,\r\n    However speedy be their legs;\r\n  But I distance her with ease\r\n    When it comes to beating eggs.\"\r\n\r\n\"I really think that you would have done better to give up the\r\negg-beater,\" said the Poet, grown critical. \"I've no patience with\r\none-rhymed quatrains. Now if you had written:\r\n\r\n  \"Great Maude S. can beat all steeds,\r\n    However speedy be their legs;\r\n  But despite her doughty deeds;\r\n    I can beat her beating eggs,\r\n\r\n\"I should not have objected.\"\r\n\r\n\"I accept the amendment,\" replied the Idiot, meekly. \"I realized the\r\nweakness of the thing myself, and thought of changing it into a couplet,\r\nwhere you only need one rhyme. How's this on a 'Carpet-Tack'?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'FOR THOUGH I'M BUT A CARPET-TACK\r\n\r\nAFAR FROM MOIL AND STRIFE,\r\n\r\nNO ONE CAN EVER TRULY SAY\r\n\r\nTHAT MINE'S A POINTLESS LIFE'\"]\r\n\r\n  \"However dull the day,\r\n    However dull the skies,\r\n  However dark the night may be,\r\n    My spirits ever rise.\r\n\r\n  \"For though I'm but a carpet-tack,\r\n    Afar from moil and strife,\r\n  No one can ever truly say\r\n    That mine's a pointless life.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is very good,\" said the Poet. \"I think almost any editor of any\r\ncomic paper would be willing to pay you three dollars for that. It is as\r\ngood as your poem on a ton of coal--simple in its expression and sweet\r\nin sentiment.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you'd think so,\" said the Idiot. \"It struck me so. I've got\r\none on a screw-driver, too, that is very much of the same order, and\r\nconveys a moral lesson to the reader who is always reaching out after\r\nthe unattainable. It reads as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"I cannot tool a tally-ho,\r\n    I cannot drive a nag;\r\n  I dare not hold the ribbons\r\n    On a hack or rumbling drag.\r\n\r\n  \"I could not guide the reins upon\r\n    A simple billy-goat,\r\n  And I should hesitate to try\r\n    To drive a can-al boat.\r\n\r\n  \"But I don't mind these things at all,\r\n    For I can drive a screw,\r\n  And I am happy, for that's just\r\n    What I was meant to do.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'I SHOULD HESITATE TO TRY TO WRITE A CAN-AL BOAT'\"]\r\n\r\n\"The fourth line of the second verse is weak, but otherwise it's good,\"\r\ncommented the Poet. \"It's not a _can_-al boat; it's a can-_al_ boat, and\r\nall the poetic license in the world wouldn't excuse your taking such\r\na liberty with language.\"\r\n\r\n\"I appreciate that,\" said the Idiot. \"But I don't see how I could get\r\naround it.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's only one way,\" said the Poet. \"I think if you omitted that\r\nverse altogether you'd improve the poem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I should have to eliminate the billy-goat,\" said the Idiot. \"That\r\ntakes a great deal of humor out of it. I always laugh when I encounter a\r\nbeast like that in poetry; he seems so helpless when incarcerated in a\r\npoem.\"\r\n\r\n\"That may be,\" observed the Poet. \"But it is my belief that the goat, of\r\nall animals in the kingdom, was the last one designed to be used in\r\npoetry, anyhow. He is bad enough in prose, and in this case will butt\r\nyour poem to oblivion if you insist on keeping him in it. Any more?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the Idiot; \"that's the last.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you've got a good start,\" said the Poet, rising to light his\r\npipe, which had gone out. \"And if I were you I'd go on and finish the\r\nbook. 'The Idiot's Book of Household Poetry' would have a great sale.\r\nIt has but one drawback that I can see. You harp on one string too much.\r\nEvery one of your poems preaches contentment, satisfaction--nothing\r\nelse.\"\r\n\r\n\"That,\" said the Idiot, \"is not an objection, but a virtue; for what\r\nother lesson,\" he added, with a glance of pride at his surroundings,\r\n\"what other lesson, my dear Poet, should a home try to teach, and what\r\nother sentiment can mean so much to mankind?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'I HAVEN'T EVER HAD A HOME; I'VE ALWAYS BOARDED'\"]\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" said the Poet, with a little sigh. \"I haven't ever had a\r\nhome; I've always boarded.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon the Idiot rose up from his chair, and putting his arm about\r\nhis friend's shoulder, said:\r\n\r\n\"How you do talk! Never had a home? Why, my dear fellow, what's this?\r\nIt's yours as long as it's mine!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nSOME CONSIDERATION OF THE HIRED MAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Who is that sitting down on your tennis-court, Mr. Idiot?\" asked Mr.\r\nBrief, the lawyer. \"Or is it anybody? I've been trying for the last\r\nhalf-hour to make out whether it's a man or one of those iron figures\r\nwith which some people decorate their lawns.\"\r\n\r\n\"That,\" replied the Idiot, calmly, \"is my hired man. I pay him forty\r\ndollars a month to sit down there and let the grass grow under his feet.\r\nI heard you and Mr. Pedagog discussing the wonderful grassiness of my\r\nlawn after dinner last night, and I meant to have told you then that the\r\ncredit thereof belongs entirely to the restful nature of that man's\r\nsoul. He will stand for hours rooted to one spot and looking with\r\napparent aimlessness out over the river. To most people this would seem\r\nto be prompted by a sheer indisposition to work, but this would do him a\r\nrank injustice, for his immovability is due entirely to his system. He\r\nis letting the grass grow beneath him, and the fact that our grass is so\r\nnourishing everywhere is due to his having stood for hours at various\r\ntimes over every square inch of territory to which I hold the\r\ntitle-deeds.\"\r\n\r\nThe Idiot gazed out of the window at his retainer with affectionate\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\n\"He certainly clings closely to his system,\" said the lawyer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'I FEEL THAT I COULD GO OUT AND MOW THREE ACRES OF\r\nGRASS'\"]\r\n\r\n\"He is a model,\" said the Idiot. \"He has done more to make my life here\r\neasy than any one in my service. For instance, you know the hurly-burly\r\nof existence in town. I go to my office in the morning, and whether I\r\nhave much work or little to do, I come home in the afternoon absolutely\r\nworn out. The constant hustling and bustling of others in the city wears\r\nupon my mind, and consequently upon my body. The rush and roar of cables\r\nand electric-cars; the activity of messengers running to and fro in the\r\nstreets; the weary horses dragging great lumbering wagons up and down\r\nthe crowded thoroughfares, all affect my nature and impair my energy;\r\nand then, the day's work done, I return here, where all is quiet and\r\nstill, and the very contrast between that man, standing silently on his\r\nappointed spot, or leaning against the house, or lying off in sheer\r\ncontent under some tree, and the mad scramble for lucre in the city,\r\ninvigorates my tired body until I feel that I could go out and mow three\r\nacres of grass before dinner; in fact, I generally do.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not know that a restful nature was a requisite of a successful\r\ncareer as a hired man,\" said Mr. Pedagog.\r\n\r\n\"It is evident, then, that you have never had a hired man,\" rejoined the\r\nIdiot. \"Nor can you ever have studied the species at close range.\r\nCeaseless activity would be his ruin. If he did to-day all there is to\r\ndo, he would be out of employment to-morrow, consequently he never does\r\nto-day's work to-day, and cultivates that leisurely attitude towards\r\nlife upon which you have commented. Do you see that small beech-tree\r\nover there?\" he added, pointing to a scrawny little sapling whose sole\r\nvirtue appeared to be its rigid uprightness.\r\n\r\n\"Is that a beech-tree?\" asked Mr. Brief. \"I thought it was a garden\r\nstake.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'He WOULD GO OUT DAY AFTER DAY AND SIT DOWN BESIDE IT'\"]\r\n\r\n\"It is a beech-tree,\" said the Idiot. \"I planted it myself last autumn,\r\nand while it has as yet borne no beeches, I think if we give it time,\r\nand it withstands the rigors of the climate, it will produce its fruit.\r\nBut it was not of its possibilities as a beech-bearing tree that I\r\nintended to speak. I wanted to indicate to you by a material object the\r\nvalue of having a hired man who likes to lean against things. At the\r\nclose of this last winter that tree, instead of being as erect as a\r\ngrenadier, as it now is, was all askew. The strong westerly winds which\r\nare constantly blowing across that open stretch bent the thing until it\r\nseemed that the tree was bound to be deformed; but Mike overcame the\r\ndifficulty. He would go out day after day and sit down beside it and\r\nlean against it for two and three hours at a time, with the result that\r\nthe tendency to curve was overcome, and a tree that I feared was doomed\r\nto fail now bids fair to resemble a successful telegraph-pole in its\r\nuprightness. And, of course, the added warmth of his body pressing down\r\nupon the earth which covers its roots gave it an added impulse to\r\ngrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a wonderful system,\" smiled Mr. Brief. \"I wonder it is not\r\nadopted everywhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is, pretty much,\" said the Idiot. \"Most hired men do the same thing.\r\nI don't think Mike differs radically from others of his kind. Of course,\r\nthere are exceptions. My neighbor Jimpsonberry, for instance, has a man\r\nwho is so infernally unrestful that he makes everybody tired. He is up\r\nevery morning mowing Jimpsonberry's lawn at five o'clock, waking up\r\nevery sleepy soul within ear-shot with the incessant and disturbing\r\nclicking of his machine. Mike would never think of making such a\r\nnuisance of himself. Furthermore, Jimpsonberry's lawn is kept so\r\nclose-cropped that the grass doesn't get any chance, and in the heat of\r\nmidsummer turns to a dull brick-red.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a pause, during which the company seemed to be deeply cogitating\r\nthe philosophical bearing of the subject under discussion, the Idiot\r\nresumed:\r\n\r\n\"There is another aspect of this matter,\" he said, \"which Jimpsonberry's\r\nman brings to my mind. You know as well as I do that heat is\r\ncontagious. If you feel as cool as a cucumber, and then all of a sudden\r\nsee somebody who is dripping with perspiration and looking for all the\r\nworld like a human kettle simmering on a kitchen-range, you begin to\r\nsimmer yourself. It is mere sympathy, of course, but you simmer just the\r\nsame, get uncomfortable and hot in the collar, and are shortly as badly\r\noff as the other fellow. So it is with Jimpsonberry's man. Time and time\r\nagain he has spoiled all my pleasure by making me realize by a glance at\r\nhis red face and sweating arms how beastly hot it is, when before I had\r\nseen him I felt tolerably comfortable. Mike, on the other hand, is not\r\nso inconsiderate, and I am confident would let the grass grow a mile\r\nhigh before he would consent to interfere with my temperature by pushing\r\nthe mower up and down the lawn on a humid day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you keep this interesting specimen of still life all through the\r\nyear?\" asked Mr. Brief, \"or do you give him a much-needed vacation in\r\nwinter? I should think he would be worn out with all this standing\r\naround, for nothing that I know of is more tiresome than doing\r\nnothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the Idiot. \"Mike never seems to need a vacation. Sitting down\r\nand leaning against things and standing around don't seem to tire him in\r\nthe least. It might tire you or me, but you see he's used to it. The\r\nonly effect it has on him, as I view the matter, is that it wears out\r\nhis clothes. It doesn't impair his lack of vigor at all. So by the\r\nsimple act of occasionally renewing his wardrobe, which I do every time\r\nI discard a suit of my own, I revive his wasted vitality, and he does\r\nnot require to be sent to Europe, or to take an extended tour in the\r\nWhite Mountains to recuperate. I keep him all through the winter, and\r\nhis system is quite the same then as in summer, except that he does his\r\nsitting around and leaning indoors instead of in the open.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose he looks after the furnace and keeps the walks clear of snow\r\nin winter time?\" suggested Mr. Pedagog, who was beginning to take an\r\ninterest in this marvellously restful personage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'HE SHOVELS OFF A FOOT-PATH'\"]\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the Idiot; \"and he attends to the windows as well. As a\r\nminder of the furnace he is invaluable. My house is as cool as a\r\nroof-garden all through the winter, and thanks to his unwillingness to\r\nover-exert himself shovelling coal into the furnace, I burn only about\r\nhalf as much as my neighbors, and my house is never overheated. This in\r\nitself is an indication of the virtue of Mike's method. One-half of the\r\ncolds contracted by children nowadays are the result of overheated\r\nhouses. Mike's method gives me a cool house at very moderate expense,\r\nowing to the great saving of coal, the children do not get colds because\r\nof overheating, and the expense of having a doctor every other day is\r\naverted. Then his snow-shovelling scheme goes back to the first\r\nprinciples of nature. Mike is not overawed by convention, and instead of\r\nfollowing the steps of other men who shovel the snow entirely off, he\r\nshovels off a footpath to enable me to go to business, and then sits\r\ndown and oversees the sun while it melts the balance. Sometimes, if the\r\nsun does not do the work promptly enough to suit him, he gets up little\r\ncontests for the children. He divides up certain portions of the walk\r\ninto equal parts, and starts the small boys on a race to see which one\r\nwill get the portion assigned to him cleaned off first, the prize being\r\nsomething in the nature of an apple, which the cook orders from the\r\nmarket. I believe my son Thomas won ten apples last winter, although I\r\nam told that the Jimpsonberry boy, whose father's man is cross, and\r\ninsists on doing all the work himself, is the champion snow-shoveller of\r\nthe street.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he is, pa,\" put in Tommy. \"Mike owes him 'leven apples. I only won\r\neight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that is a very good record, Thomas,\" said the Idiot, \"and I will\r\nsee to it that next winter you have a brand-new snow-shovel with which\r\nto enter the contest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mike lets us chop the kindling-wood, too,\" said Tommy, suddenly\r\nperceiving a chance to put in a good word for the genial Mike. \"I think\r\nhe's the nicest hired man as ever was.\"\r\n\r\n\"He'll stop anything he's doing to talk to me,\" ventured Mollie, not\r\nwishing to be backward in laying wreaths upon the brow of their friend.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I have noticed that,\" said the Idiot. \"Indeed, next to his extreme\r\nrestfulness there is no quality that I know of in Mike that shines out\r\nso conspicuously as his intense love for children. He will neglect his\r\nown interests, as Mollie has suggested, to talk to the little ones, and\r\nI rather like him for it. No boy dares go near the Jimpsonberry man, who\r\nhas exerted himself into a perpetual state of nervous exhaustion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if he cleans your windows, that is something,\" observed Mrs.\r\nPedagog, whose experience in keeping a boarding-house years before\r\nentitled her to speak as one having authority.\r\n\r\n\"Unless his system is the same in that work as in the other branches\r\ncommitted to his care,\" said Mr. Brief.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'SPEND A WHOLE DAY ON ONE WINDOW'\"]\r\n\r\n\"It isn't quite,\" said the Idiot. \"He really does exert himself in\r\nwindow-cleaning. I have frequently seen him spend a whole day on one\r\nwindow. His window-washing system is a very ingenious one,\r\nnevertheless.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is, indeed,\" said Mrs. Idiot, with a show of feeling.\r\n\r\n\"A new window-washing system?\" grinned Mr. Pedagog.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the Idiot. \"It is his own invention. He washes them on the\r\noutside in summer and on the inside in winter. The result is this\r\nopalescent glass which you see. You would hardly guess that these\r\nwindows are of French plate. Still, we don't mind so much. I couldn't\r\nask him to wash them on the outside in winter, it is so dreadfully cold,\r\nand in the summer, of course, they are always open, and no one, unless\r\nhe were disagreeable enough to go snooping about after unpleasant\r\ndetails, would notice that they are not immaculate.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you pay this man forty dollars for this?\" demanded Mr. Brief.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, for this and other things. I pay him two dollars a month for the\r\nwork he does. I pay him ten dollars a month because he's good to the\r\nchildren. I pay him ten dollars more for his civility, which is\r\nunvarying--he always puts his hat on when he comes into the house,\r\nhaving noticed, perhaps, that only those who are my social equals are\r\nentitled to appear bareheaded in my presence.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the other eighteen?\" persisted the lawyer, by nature a\r\ncross-examiner.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't grudge him that because--\" a sort of a fond light lit up\r\nthe Idiot's eyes as he gazed down upon Mike, still sitting on the\r\ntennis-court--\"I don't grudge him that other eighteen dollars because it\r\ncosts Mike twenty dollars a month to live; and he uses the rest of it to\r\nput his boy through college, so that when he grows up to be a man he\r\nwill be something more than a hired man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Brief.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the Idiot; \"I found that out from a third party some time\r\nago, and I thought after all I'd keep him, for I know nobody else would\r\nhave him, and then what would become of the boy in college?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nON SOCIAL ACCOUNTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It's rather strange, I think,\" observed Mrs. Idiot one evening, as she\r\nand the Idiot sat down to dine, \"that the Dawkinses haven't been here\r\nfor three or four months.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've noticed it myself,\" said the Idiot. \"We used to see 'em every day\r\nabout. What's up? You and Polly Dawkins had a fight?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not that I know of,\" said Mrs. Idiot. \"The last time we met she was\r\nvery cordial, and asked most affectionately after you and the children.\r\nI presumed that possibly you and Dick had had some kind of a falling\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit of it. Dick and I couldn't quarrel any more than you and\r\nPolly could. Perhaps as we grow older our ideals differ. Polly's rather\r\nanthropological in her talks, isn't she?\"\r\n\r\n\"A trifle,\" said Mrs. Idiot. \"And musical and literary and scientific.\"\r\n\r\n\"While you?\" queried the Idiot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'WELL, I'M FOND OF GOLF'\"]\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm fond of golf and--ah--well--\"\r\n\r\n\"Golf again,\" laughed the Idiot. \"I guess that's it, Bess. When a woman\r\nwants to talk about the origin of the species and has to hear about a\r\nsplendid putt, and her observations upon the sonata are invariably\r\ninterrupted by animadversions upon the morals of caddies, and her\r\ncriticisms of Browning end in a discussion of the St. Andrew's Rules,\r\nshe's apt to shy off into a more congenial atmosphere, don't you think?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure,\" retorted Mrs. Idiot, \"that while I admit I am more\r\ninterested in golf than in anything else outside of you and the\r\nchildren, I can and do talk sometimes of other things than caddies, and\r\nbeautiful drives, and stymies. You are very much mistaken if you think\r\notherwise.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is very true, my dear,\" said the Idiot. \"And nobody knows it\r\nbetter than I do. I've heard you talk charmingly about lots of things\r\nbesides stymies, and foozles, and putts, and drives, but you don't know\r\nanything about the men of the Stone Age, and you couldn't tell the\r\ndifference between a sonata and a fugue any more than I. Furthermore,\r\nyou have no patience with Browning, so that when Polly Dawkins asks if\r\nyou like _Sordello_, you are more likely than not to say that you never\r\nate any, but on the whole for small fish prefer whitebait.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Idiot laughed.\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed,\" she replied. \"I'd fall back on golf if Polly mentioned\r\n_Sordello_ to me. You may remember that you sent it to me when we were\r\nengaged, and I loved you so much--then--that I read it. If I hadn't\r\nloved you I couldn't have done it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" smiled the Idiot, \"what did you think of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think Browning had a good lie, but he foozled,\" said Mrs. Idiot, with\r\nher eyes atwinkle, and the Idiot subsided for at least ten seconds.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you'd say that to Polly some time,\" he observed. \"It's so very\r\ntrue, and put with an originality which cannot but appeal to the most\r\nhardened of literary women.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will if I ever get the chance,\" said Mrs. Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose we make the chance?\" suggested the Idiot. \"Let's go down there\r\nand call to-night. I'll work the conversation up so that you can get\r\nthat off as an impromptu.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"AN ANTHROPOLOGICAL TEA\"]\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Mrs. Idiot. \"I don't think we'd better. In the first place,\r\nMrs. Whalker told me yesterday that Polly is to read a paper on Balzac\r\nbefore the S. F. M. E. to-morrow evening, and on Friday morning she is\r\nto discuss the 'Influence of Mozart on De Koven' before the Musical\r\nMothers' Meeting, and on Saturday afternoon she is going to have an\r\nanthropological tea at her house, which she is to open with some\r\nspeculations as to whether in the Glacial Period dudes were addicted to\r\nthe use of cigarettes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Great Scott!\" said the Idiot. \"This is her busy week.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tolerably so,\" said Mrs. Idiot. \"She has probably reserved this evening\r\nto read up on Balzac for to-morrow's essay, so I think, my dear, we'd\r\nbetter not go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right as usual,\" said the Idiot. And then he added, \"Poor Dawkins, who\r\nis taking care of him now?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" said Mrs. Idiot, \"that possibly Mrs. Dawkins has sublet the\r\ncontract for looking after her husband and children to the United\r\nStates Housekeeping Company Limited.\"\r\n\r\nThe Idiot gazed blankly at his wife, and awaited an explanation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'THE BABY IS ROCKED TO SLEEP EVERY NIGHT'\"]\r\n\r\n\"An organization, my dear,\" she continued, \"formed by a number of\r\nwell-meaning and remorseful widows who, having lost their husbands,\r\nbegin to appreciate their virtues, and who, finding themselves\r\nsympathetic when it is too late, are devoting themselves to the husbands\r\nof others who are neglected. A subscription of five hundred dollars will\r\nsecure the supervision of all the domestic arrangements of a\r\nhome--marketing, engagement and discharge of domestics, house-cleaning,\r\nbuttons sewed on, darning done, care of flowers, wifely duties\r\ngenerally; for one thousand dollars they will bring up the children, and\r\nsee that the baby is rocked to sleep every night, and suitably\r\ninterested in elevating narratives and poems like Joseph's coat of many\r\ncolors, and Tom, Tom the Piper's Son. This enables an advanced woman\r\nlike Mrs. Dawkins to devote her mornings to the encyclopedias, her\r\nafternoons to the public libraries, and her evenings to the functions\r\nwhereat she may read the papers which her devotion to the encyclopedias\r\nand the libraries has brought forth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, my dear Bess,\" said the Idiot, rising. \"I wish to telephone\r\nDr. Simmons.\"\r\n\r\n\"For what--for whom?\" demanded the lady.\r\n\r\n\"You, of course,\" returned the Idiot. \"You are developing alarming\r\nsymptoms. You give every indication of a bad attack of professional\r\nhumor. Your 'International Widows Company for the Protection and\r\nAmelioration of Neglected Husbandry' proves that!\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Idiot laughed again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"POOR DICK DAWKINS ISN'T TAKEN CARE OF AT ALL'\"]\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I didn't say that there really is such an institution!\" she cried.\r\n\"I said that I supposed there was, for if there isn't, poor Dick Dawkins\r\nisn't taken care of at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm sorry for it all, anyhow,\" said the Idiot, seriously.\r\n\"They're both of 'em good friends of ours, and I hate to see two\r\nfamilies that have been so close drawing apart.\"\r\n\r\nJust then Mollie and Tommy came in.\r\n\r\n\"Mamma, Willie Dawkins says he can't come to our party because his ma\r\nwon't let him,\" said Mollie. \"She says we don't never go down there.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it,\" said the Idiot. \"Mrs. Dawkins has got so many irons in the\r\nfire she's begun to keep social books. I'll bet you she's got a ledger\r\nand a full set of double-entry account-books charging up calls payable\r\nand calls receivable.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see how she can get along unless she has,\" replied Mrs. Idiot.\r\n\"With all her clubs and church societies and varied social obligations\r\nshe needs an expert accountant to keep track of them all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose a promise to read a paper on Balzac,\" put in the Idiot, \"is\r\nsomething like a three-months' note. It's easy to promise to pay, with\r\nthree months in which to prepare, but you've got to keep track of the\r\ndate and meet the obligation when it falls due. As for me, I'd rather\r\nmeet the note.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is about it,\" said Mrs. Idiot. \"If a woman goes into society\r\nproperly she's got to make a business of it. For instance, there are\r\nabout ten dances given at the club here every year. Polly is patroness\r\nfor every one of 'em. There are twenty-five teas during the spring and\r\nsummer months. Polly assists at half of them, and gives a fifth of\r\nthem. She's president of the King's Daughters, corresponding secretary\r\nof the Dorcas, treasurer of the Red Cross Society, and goodness knows\r\nwhat all!\"\r\n\r\n\"I can quite understand why she needs to keep accounts--social\r\naccounts,\" said the Idiot. \"But it's rather queer, don't you think, that\r\nshe has the children on her books? The idea of saying that Jimmie and\r\nGladys can't come to Mollie's party because Mollie hasn't been down\r\nthere--why, it's nonsense!\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Mrs. Idiot, \"it is merely logical. Whatever Polly Dawkins\r\ndoes she tries to do thoroughly. I've no doubt she'll do Balzac up\r\ncompletely. If she keeps social books showing call balances in her favor\r\nor against herself she might as well go the whole thing and write the\r\nchildren in--only she's made a mistake, as far as we are concerned,\r\nunless she means to write us off without squaring up.\"\r\n\r\n\"You talk like a financier,\" said the Idiot, admiringly. \"What do you\r\nknow about writing off?\"\r\n\r\n\"I used to help my father with his accounts, occasionally,\" said Mrs.\r\nIdiot. \"Polly Dawkins's books ought to show a balance of one call in\r\nour favor. That's really the reason I'm not willing to call there\r\nto-night. She's so queer about it all, and, as a matter of fact, she\r\nowes me a call. I'm not going to overwhelm her with an added\r\nobligation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ho!\" smiled the Idiot. \"You keep books yourself, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"I keep score,\" said Mrs. Idiot. \"I learned that playing golf.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a bad thing to keep score in golf,\" said the Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"So they say, but I find it amusing,\" she replied.\r\n\r\n\"And how many calls does Mrs. Wilkins owe you?\" demanded the Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" returned the wife. \"And I don't care. When I want to see\r\nMrs. Wilkins I call on her whether she owes me a call or not, but with\r\nPolly Dawkins it's different. She began the book-keeping, and as long as\r\nshe likes it I must try to live up to her ideas. If social intercourse\r\ndevelops into a business, business requirements must be observed.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a good idea in a way,\" said the Idiot, reflectively. \"But if you\r\nmake a business of society, why don't you carry it to a logical\r\nconclusion? Balance your books, if you mean business, every month, and\r\nsend your debtors a statement of their account.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I will if you wish me to,\" said Mrs. Idiot. \"Suppose they don't\r\npay?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dun 'em,\" said the Idiot. And then the matter dropped.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth of the following month Mr. and Mrs. Idiot were seated\r\ncomfortably in their library. The children had gone to bed, and they\r\nwere enjoying the bliss of a quiet evening at home, when the door-bell\r\nrang, and in a moment or two the maid ushered in Mr. and Mrs. Richard\r\nDawkins, preceded, of course, by their cards. The young householders\r\nwere delighted, and Polly Dawkins was never more charming. She looked\r\nwell, and she talked well, and there was not a symptom of any diminution\r\nof the old-time friendship perceptible--only she did appear to be tired\r\nand care-worn.\r\n\r\nThe evening wore away pleasantly. The chat reverted to old times, and by\r\ndegrees Mrs. Dawkins seemed to grow less tired.\r\n\r\nAbout ten o'clock the Idiot invited his neighbor to adjourn to the\r\nsmoking-room, where they each lit a cigar and indulged in a\r\ncompanionable glass.\r\n\r\n\"Idiot,\" said Dawkins, when his wife called out to him that it was time\r\nto go home, \"your wife is a wonder. I've been trying for three months to\r\nmake Polly come up here and she wouldn't. Keeps books, you know--now.\r\nHas to--so much to do. Thought you owed us a call, but received your\r\nbill Wednesday--looked it up--questioned servants--found you were\r\nright.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bill,\" cried the Idiot. \"What bill?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, the one Mrs. Idiot sent--this,\" said Dawkins, taking a piece of\r\npaper out of his pocket. \"Confoundedly good joke.\"\r\n\r\nThe Idiot took up the piece of paper. It was type-written--on Tommy's\r\nmachine--and read as follows:\r\n\r\n  November 1 1898\r\n  MR. AND MRS. RICHARD DAWKINS\r\n  _To Mr. and Mrs. Idiot Dr._\r\n\r\n  September 20       Evening call                1\r\n                     Account overdue.\r\n                     Please remit.\r\n\r\n\"Great Scott!\" laughed the Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"My dear,\" said the Idiot after the Dawkinses had gone, \"that bill of\r\nyours was a great idea.\"\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't my idea at all--it was yours,\" said Mrs. Idiot, laughing.\r\n\"You said we ought to be business-like to the last and send out a\r\nstatement on the first of the month. I sent it. And they paid up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Richard,\" said Mrs. Dawkins, as they drove home, \"did you get a\r\nreceipt?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nAS TO SANTA CLAUS\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am very glad I didn't take Tommy and Mollie to church with me this\r\nmorning,\" said Mrs. Idiot, on her return from service. \"It would have\r\nbroken their hearts to have heard the sermon. I don't know what gets\r\ninto Dr. Preachly sometimes. He gave us a blast about Santa Claus.\"\r\n\r\n\"A blast about Santa Claus, eh!\" said the Idiot. \"And how did he blast\r\nthe good old saint?\"\r\n\r\n\"He said he was a lie,\" rejoined Mrs. Idiot, indignantly, \"and that it\r\nwas the duty of every Christian in the land to see that the lie was\r\nexposed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Great heavens!\" cried the Idiot, in astonishment. \"Doesn't Dr. Preachly\r\nbelieve in Santa Claus? Poor old Preachly! How much he has lost! Did he\r\nsay anything about Hop o' My Thumb and Cinderella?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, of course not. Why should he?\" returned Mrs. Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, because; I suppose that a man who doesn't believe in Santa Claus is\r\na skeptic on the subject of Hop o' My Thumb, and Rumpelstiltzken, and\r\nCinderella, and Jack the Giant-Killer, and all the rest of that noble\r\narmy of childhood friends,\" explained the Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"He didn't mention them,\" said Mrs. Idiot. \"He--\"\r\n\r\n\"He's going to preach a series of sermons on lies, I presume,\" said the\r\nIdiot. \"He's tackled Santa Claus first, as being the most seasonable of\r\nthe lot, eh? Jack the Giant-Killer ought to be a good subject for a\r\nministerial attack.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, he pulled poor old Santa Claus to pieces,\" said Mrs. Idiot, with\r\na sigh.\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you bring me a piece of him as a souvenir?\" demanded the\r\nIdiot. \"Just a lock of his hair for my collection of curios? What was\r\ndone with the remains?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Idiot laughed as she pulled over her gloves and smoothed them upon\r\nher lap.\r\n\r\n\"There weren't any remains,\" she answered. \"When Dr. Preachly got\r\nthrough with him there wasn't a vestige of the old chap left. To begin\r\nwith, he was a lie, the doctor said. Then he went on and showed that he\r\nwas a wickedly partial old fellow--a very snob, he called him--because\r\nhe gives fine things to the children of the rich and little or nothing\r\nto the children of the poor. He filled the little folk with hope and\r\nbrought them disappointment, and so on. It was a powerful sermon,\r\nalthough I wanted to weep over it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go ahead and weep,\" said the Idiot; \"it's the appropriate thing to do.\r\nI don't wonder you wanted to cry; you've always liked Dr. Preachly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said Mrs. Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"And you hate to see him make a--ah--a--well, you know--of himself in\r\nthe pulpit; and I quite agree with you. I rather like Preachly myself.\r\nIt is too bad to see a well-meaning man like that batting his brains out\r\nagainst the rock of Gibraltar, whether suicide is sin or not. What has\r\nput him in this despondent mood? Do you suppose he has heard?\"\r\n\r\n\"Heard what?\" demanded Mrs. Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"About the slippers,\" said the Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"What slippers?\" asked his wife.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, the same old slippers,\" said the Idiot. \"You know the ones I\r\nmean--the ones he's going to get from Santa Claus. Really, I'm not\r\nsurprised, after all. If I were a minister, and realized that truckloads\r\nof embroidered slippers of every size and color, covered with stags of\r\nred worsted jumping over rivulets of yellow floss, with split agates for\r\neyes set in over the toe, were to be dumped in my front yard every\r\nChristmas Eve by that old reprobate, Santa Claus, I think I, too, would\r\nset him down as a fraud, or an overworked cobbler, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'DR. PREACHLY ONLY GOT EIGHT PAIRS LAST XMAS'\"]\r\n\r\n\"That's exaggerated--a comic-paper idea,\" said Mrs. Idiot. \"I don't\r\nbelieve the average clergyman gets so many slippers. Dr. Preachly only\r\ngot eight pairs last Christmas.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that all?\" cried the Idiot. \"Mercy, what a small income of slippers!\r\nDear me! how can he live with only eight pairs of slippers? But, after\r\nall, slippers are an appropriate gift for a clergyman,\" he added, \"and\r\nSanta Claus should be credited with that fact. Slippers have soles, and\r\nthe more slippers he gets the easier it is to save their soles, and\r\ntherefore--\"\r\n\r\n\"Really, my dear, you are flippant,\" said Mrs. Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" rejoined the Idiot. \"I am merely trying to sit on two\r\nstools at once--to retain my respect for Dr. Preachly without giving up\r\nmy everlasting regard for Santa Claus. If I can't do both I am very much\r\nafraid it will be Dr. Preachly, and not Santa Claus, who will go to the\r\nwall in this establishment, and that would be sad. I can't say I think\r\nmuch of the doctor's logic. Do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't notice his logic,\" Mrs. Idiot replied.\r\n\r\n\"Very likely,\" said the Idiot; \"from what you tell me of his discourse I\r\nimagine he must have left it at home, which is a bad thing to do in an\r\nargument. To begin, he called Santa a lie, did he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; said he didn't exist at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good! Then how could he have been a snob?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, while of course I have no sympathy with his conclusions, Dr.\r\nPreachly handled that point pretty well. It certainly is true that in\r\nthe homes of the rich there is a lavishness of gifts that you don't\r\nfind in the homes of the poor, and therefore Santa Claus treats the rich\r\nbetter than he does the poor. We all know that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hum!\" said the Idiot. \"And so it is Santa Claus who is the snob, eh,\r\nand not Fortune?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Dr. Preachly did not touch upon that. All he said was that Santa\r\nClaus was a snob for favoring 'high society' and in many cases\r\nabsolutely ignoring the submerged.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I don't see how,\" said the Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose he brings a diamond necklace to the daughter of a Croesus?\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely,\" said the Idiot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'A CHINA DOLL TO THE DAUGHTER OF A CARPENTER'\"]\r\n\r\n\"And a china doll to the daughter of a carpenter?\" said Mrs. Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"That's tact, not snobbishness,\" said the Idiot. \"What would the\r\ndaughter of a carpenter do with a diamond necklace? The china doll is\r\nnot only more appropriate, but a better plaything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, anyhow, he gives richly to those that have, and sparsely, if at\r\nall, to those that haven't, Dr. Preachly said,\" said Mrs. Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"There is scriptural authority for that,\" observed the Idiot. \"I wonder\r\nif Dr. Preachly reads his Bible! Perhaps I'd better send him one for\r\nChristmas instead of a pair of galoshes. He'll find in the Bible that\r\n'to him that hath shall be given,' and so forth. But to return to the\r\nlogic--\"\r\n\r\n\"I told you I didn't notice it,\" said Mrs. Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"Nor did Dr. Preachly, my dear; passed it by as if it were a poor\r\nrelation, apparently. But this is true, a lie is an untruth. Truth alone\r\nlives, therefore an untruth does not live. Santa Claus is a lie and does\r\nnot live, and is a snob, according to our reverend logician. Now, how\r\ncan one who does not live be a snob or anything else? Truly, I wish Dr.\r\nPreachly would be more careful in his statements. As a pew-holder in his\r\nchurch I do not like to hear him denounce something that does not exist\r\nas having unworthy qualities. It's like shaking a sword at nothing and\r\npatting yourself on the back afterwards for your courage; still more in\r\nthis instance is it like batting your poor mortal head against the hard\r\nsurface of an everlasting rock, and our clergy should be in better\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\"Let 'em fight the harmful lies--the lies of false social ideas as\r\npropagated by distinctions of pew-holding, for instance. The man who\r\nsits in the front of the church is no better than the man who sits at\r\nthe back, and is frequently his inferior; but has he more or has he less\r\ninfluence? The man who hands in his check for ten thousand dollars,\r\nhaving that and more to spare, is not more the friend of religion and\r\nChristianity than the poor beggar who stumbles in and puts his penny in\r\nthe plate, thus diminishing by one-fifth his capital. Suppose Santa\r\nClaus is in a material sense a fancy or a lie; Heaven help Dr. Preachly\r\nif he can't see the beauty and the ethical value of the deception. Is he\r\nnot the embodiment of the golden rule, and is he not, after all--God\r\nbless him and them!--something beautiful in the eyes of the children?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm flippant, and I know it, but there are some things I cling to,\" he\r\nadded, after a pause. \"Santa Claus is one of them, and Dr. Preachly can\r\npreach through all eternity, and, with all due respect to him, he can't\r\nremove from my mind the beauty of an idea that was planted there by two\r\npeople who were practical enough, my father and my mother. I've\r\ninherited Santa Claus, and I'm not going to give him up, and no\r\npreacher in our church or in the church of others can take him away from\r\nme by one sermon, or by an infinite number of sermons, however sincere\r\nthey may be. Is dinner ready?\"\r\n\r\nDinner was ready. It was eaten reflectively, and after it the children\r\nwent to Sunday-school. From this Tommy returned with a swollen eye,\r\nwhich later became dark.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo, pop!\" he said, addressing the Idiot as he entered the house.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'HULLO, SONNY! HAD A GOOD TIME?'\"]\r\n\r\n\"Hullo, sonny!\" replied the Idiot, observing the swollen eye. \"Had a\r\ngood time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yep,\" said the boy; \"pretty good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Been fighting?\" suggested the Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"Not so very much,\" said the boy; \"only a little.\" And he began to sing\r\na popular air, as if he didn't care much about life in general, and\r\ndidn't mind an aching eye, which was rapidly, by its inflammation,\r\ngiving away the fact that he had met with trouble.\r\n\r\n\"What did you learn at Sunday-school?\" asked the Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"More blessed to give than to receive,\" said Tommy.\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" said the Idiot. \"I hope you will remember that, sonny. There is\r\nno satisfaction in all the world like that of giving if you can afford\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'I GAVE MY DOLLY AWAY TO-DAY'\"]\r\n\r\n\"I think tho, too,\" said Mollie, sitting down on her father's lap with\r\nthe contented sigh of a little girl who has discovered that life is not\r\nall an illusion. \"I gave my dollie away to-day, papa,\" she added. \"She\r\nwath only thawdust, and Pollie Harrington hath her now. She was a\r\ndrefful care, and I'm glad to be ridden of her.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Idiot's mind was not on dolls, and he showed it. His boy's eye\r\nproved a greater care.\r\n\r\n\"Come here, my boy,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe boy approached inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\"How did this happen?\" the Idiot asked. \"Your eye is swollen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" cried Tommy, exultantly. \"Jimmie Roberts said there\r\nwasn't no Santy Claus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"I said there was, an' then I gave him one on the end of his nose.\"\r\n\r\nHere the boy struggled away from his father, as if he had done something\r\nhe was willing to stand by.\r\n\r\n\"Let me understand this,\" said the Idiot. \"Jimmie said--\"\r\n\r\n\"There wasn't any Santy Claus,\" interrupted Tommy.\r\n\r\n\"Then what did you say?\" asked the Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"I told him he didn't know what he was talking about,\" said Tommy.\r\n\r\n\"Why did you say that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because he was wrong, papa,\" said Tommy. \"I've seen Santy Claus; I saw\r\nhim last year.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! You did, eh? I was not aware of that fact.\"\r\n\r\nTommy began to laugh.\r\n\r\n\"You can't fool me, daddy,\" he said, climbing onto his father's knee.\r\n\"Of course I've seen him, and he's the bulliest feller in all the world.\r\n_You're him!_\"\r\n\r\nAnd a hug followed.\r\n\r\nLater on Mrs. Idiot and the Idiot sat together. The latter was deep in\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n\"Children have queer notions,\" said he, after a while.\r\n\r\n\"They are generally pretty right, though,\" observed Mrs. Idiot. \"You are\r\na pretty good Santa Claus, after all,\" she added.\r\n\r\n\"Pollie,\" said the Idiot, rising, \"I believe in Santa Claus because he\r\nrepresents the spirit of the hour, and whoever tries to turn him down\r\ntries to turn down that spirit--the most blessed thing we have. Let's\r\nkeep the children believing in Santa Claus, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"I agree,\" said Mrs. Idiot. \"For the secret is out. You are Santa Claus\r\nto them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heaven grant I may always be as much,\" said the Idiot. \"For if a father\r\nis Santa Claus, and a boy or a girl believes in Santa Claus as a friend,\r\nas a companion, as something that brings them only sincerity and love\r\nand sympathy, then may we feel that Tiny Tim's prayer has been answered,\r\nand that God has blessed us all.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nAS TO NEW-YEAR'S DAY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was New-Year's eve, and Mr. and Mrs. Idiot with their old friends\r\nwere watching the old year die. The old year had been a fairly\r\nsuccessful one for them all, and they were properly mournful over its\r\nprospective demise, but the promise of the new was sufficiently bright\r\nto mitigate their sorrow.\r\n\r\n\"What a sandwich life is, after all!\" ejaculated the Idiot.\r\n\r\nMr. Pedagog started nervously. The remark was so idiotic that even its\r\nsource seemed to make it inexcusable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'I DON'T QUITE CATCH YOUR DRIFT'\"]\r\n\r\n\"I don't quite catch your drift,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"As the man said when an avalanche of snow fell off his neighbor's roof\r\nand missed him by an inch,\" said the Idiot. \"Why, just think a moment,\r\nDoctor, and my drift will overwhelm you. Look about you and consider\r\nwhat we have ourselves demonstrated to-night. If that does not prove\r\nlife a series of emotional sandwiches, then I don't know what a sandwich\r\nis. Twenty minutes ago we were all gladness over the prosperity of the\r\nyear gone by. Five minutes ago we were all on the verge of tears because\r\nthe good old year is going the way of all years. An hour from now we\r\nwill be joyously acclaiming the new. Two thick slices of joy with a thin\r\nslice of grief between.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Pedagog. \"I see. There is something in the analogy, after\r\nall. The bread of joy and the ham of sorrow, as you might put it; do\r\nmake up the sum of human existence; but in some cases, my lad, I am\r\nafraid you will find there is only one slice of bread to two of ham.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt,\" replied the Idiot, \"but that does not affect my proposition\r\nthat life is a sandwich. If one slice of ham between two slices of bread\r\nis a ham sandwich, why is not one slice of bread between two slices of\r\nham a bread sandwich? What is a sandwich, anyhow? The dictionary says\r\nthat a sandwich is something placed between two other things; hence,\r\nall things are sandwiches, because there is nothing in the world, the\r\nworld being round, that is not between two other things. Therefore, all\r\nthings being sandwiches, life is a sandwich, Q. E. D.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is life a thing?\" demanded Mr. Pedagog.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said the Idiot. \"And a mighty good thing, too. If you don't\r\nbelieve it look the word thing up in the dictionary. All things are\r\nthings.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" continued the Schoolmaster, his old spirit of antagonism rising\r\nup in his breast, \"granted that life is a thing, what is it between so\r\nthat it becomes a sandwich?\"\r\n\r\n\"The past and the future,\" said the Idiot. \"It is a slice of the\r\nimmediate between a slice of past and one of future.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Pedagog laughed.\r\n\r\n\"You are still the same old Idiot,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the Idiot. \"Gibraltar and I and Truth are the three\r\nunchangeable things in this life, and that's why I am so happy. I'm in\r\nsuch good company. Gibraltar and Truth are good enough companions for\r\nanybody.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mollie and Tommy, who had been allowed to sit up upon this\r\nrare occasion, stirred uneasily.\r\n\r\n\"Ith I a thandwich, popper?\" said the little girl, sleepily, raising her\r\nhead from her father's shoulder and gazing into his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed, you are,\" said her father, giving her an affectionate\r\nsqueeze. \"A sugar sandwich, Mollie. You're really good enough to eat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'd rather be a pie,\" put in Tommy; \"an apple pie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, my son,\" returned the Idiot. \"Have your own way. Henceforth\r\nbe a pie if you prefer--an apple pie. But may I ask why you express this\r\npreference?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, because,\" said Tommy, \"if I'm to be an apple pie somebody's got to\r\nfill me chock-full of apple sauce.\"\r\n\r\n\"The son of his father,\" observed Mr. Whitechoker.\r\n\r\n\"I think it is a pity,\" Mrs. Pedagog put in at this point, \"that some of\r\nthe good old customs of the New Year have gone out.\"\r\n\r\n\"As to which, Mrs. Pedagog?\" asked the Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"Well, New-Year's calling particularly,\" explained the lady. \"It is no\r\nlonger the thing for people to make New-Year's calls, and I must confess\r\nI regret it. It used to be a great pleasure to me in the old days to\r\nreceive the gentlemen--my old friends, and relatives, and boarders.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why distinguish between your old friends and your boarders, Mrs.\r\nPedagog?\" interrupted the Idiot. \"They are synonymous terms.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are now,\" said the good lady, \"but--ah--they weren't always. I\r\nused sometimes to think you, for instance, didn't like me as much as you\r\nmight.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't dare,\" explained the Idiot. \"If I'd liked you as much as I\r\nmight I'd have told you so, and then Mr. Pedagog would have got jealous\r\nand there'd have been a horrid affair.\"\r\n\r\nThe lady smiled graciously, and Mr. Pedagog threw a small paper pellet\r\nat the Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"I'm much obliged to you for holding off, Idiot,\" he said. \"I don't know\r\nwhere I'd have been to-day if you'd got in ahead of me. Mrs. Pedagog has\r\nalways had a soft spot in her heart for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've got the other spot,\" said the Idiot, \"and a pair of aces are hard\r\nto beat in pairs; but I think I voice Mrs. Pedagog's sentiments in the\r\nmatter, Mr. Pedagog, when I say that she and I would always have been\r\nglad to see you every other New-Year's day if I had been the fortunate\r\nwinner of her hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Mr. Pedagog and I would have been glad to see you and Mrs. Pedagog\r\nin the sandwich years,\" said Mrs. Idiot to her husband; and then,\r\nturning to the Schoolmaster, added, \"Wouldn't we, Mr. Pedagog?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, madame,\" returned Mr. Pedagog, courteously. \"You might have been,\r\nbut I would not. If I had married you I could never have seen any one\r\nelse with pleasure. I should have kept my eyes solely for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"John!\" cried Mrs. Pedagog, arching her eyebrows.\r\n\r\n\"Pleasantry, my dear--mere pleasantry,\" returned the Schoolmaster,\r\ntapping his fingers together and smiling sweetly upon Mrs. Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"You didn't finish, Mrs. Pedagog,\" said the Idiot. \"You were telling us\r\nhow you used to enjoy New-Year's calling before it went out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Mrs. Pedagog. \"It was charming. I used positively to\r\nlook forward to its coming with delight. We women, Mr. Idiot, found the\r\nold custom very delightful.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the men, Mrs. Pedagog,\" said the Idiot, \"did you ever think of\r\nthem?\"\r\n\r\n\"What else did we think of? What else is there for a woman to think\r\nabout?\" replied Mrs. Pedagog.\r\n\r\n\"Jane!\" cried Mr. Pedagog.\r\n\r\n\"_Pleasantry, my dear--mere pleasantry_,\" returned Mrs. Pedagog,\r\nfrigidly. And Mr. Pedagog lit a cigar. It is not always pleasant to be\r\nquoted.\r\n\r\n\"Still,\" said the Idiot, \"you thought of men only as creatures of the\r\nmoment--\"\r\n\r\n\"Entirely,\" said Mrs. Pedagog.\r\n\r\n\"And not as creatures of the week following,\" said the Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"What has that to do with it?\" asked Mrs. Pedagog.\r\n\r\n\"Much--from the man's stand-point,\" returned the Idiot. \"His digestion\r\nwas butchered to make a woman's holiday. Take myself as an example. I\r\nused to make New-Year's calls; and to get through with my list by\r\nmidnight, I had to start in at nine o'clock in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nine o'clock is not so early,\" said Mr. Whitechoker.\r\n\r\n\"It's early for cake and pickled oysters,\" said the Idiot. \"And for\r\nchicken salad and wedding-cake, and for lemonade and punch, and for\r\nlobster and egg-nog, and for ice-cream and _pÃ¢tÃ©-de-foie-gras_.\"\r\n\r\n\"H'm!\" said Mr. Pedagog, reflectively. \"That's true.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so,\" observed Mr. Whitechoker, brushing off his vest, upon which\r\nthe ashes of his cigar had rested. \"Especially for the punch.\"\r\n\r\n\"There was no punch in my house,\" said Mrs. Pedagog. \"Indeed, I always\r\nserved a very simple luncheon. We did have chicken salad, of course, but\r\nthe chicken was good and the salad was crisp--\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd swear to it,\" said the Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"And we had egg-nog, but there was more egg than nog in it--\"\r\n\r\n\"Again I'd swear to it,\" said the Idiot, smacking his lips.\r\n\r\n\"And as for the lobsters, nobody ever complained--\"\r\n\r\n\"He'd have been a lobster himself who would,\" said the Idiot. \"But that\r\ndoes not prove that no one ever suffered.\"\r\n\r\n\"And as for the pickled oysters, no one ever suffered from them that I\r\nknew of,\" continued the good lady. \"They are harmless eaten in\r\nmoderation.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'I FELT AS IF I HAD SWALLOWED AS OVERSHOE'\"]\r\n\r\n\"Exactly right,\" cried the Idiot. \"No gentleman would ever complain of\r\npickled oysters, even if they were made of inferior rubber, eaten in\r\nmoderation. Yet I recall in my own experience a pickled oyster of most\r\nimpressive quality. He was not a pickled oyster of the moment. He was\r\nthe Admiral Dewey of pickled oysters. In appearance he resembled every\r\nother pickled oyster I ever met, but--well, he kept me in a state of\r\nworry for a month. Just eating him alone was eating pickled oysters in\r\nimmoderation. I felt as if I had swallowed an overshoe. He was a\r\ncharming pickled oyster, Mrs. Pedagog, and he was devoted to me, but he\r\ninvolved me in complications alongside of which the Philippine question\r\nis child's play. If a New-Year's caller could have confined his\r\nattentions to the ladies he met no harm would have come to him, but he\r\ncouldn't, you know. The day was one continuous round of effort and\r\nindigestibles. What a man got at your house and had to eat merely to\r\nshow his appreciation of your hospitality was all right and wholesome.\r\nYour lobster and egg-nog could do him no harm, but he couldn't stop with\r\nyours; he had to continue, and consume lobsters and egg-nog everywhere\r\nelse and all day long. The day resolved itself into a magnificent gorge\r\nalongside of which that of Niagara seems like a wagon-rut. It finally\r\ncame down to the point where either man or the custom had to die, and\r\nman being selfish, the custom went. Did you ever consider exactly how\r\nmuch indigestible food an amiable, well-meaning person had to consume in\r\na round of, say, three dozen calls, Mrs. Pedagog?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Brief nodded his approval. \"Now you've struck it,\" he said. \"I've\r\nbeen there, Idiot.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must confess,\" said Mrs. Pedagog, \"that I never looked into that\r\nquestion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll tell you,\" the Idiot resumed. \"The last time I made\r\nNew-Year's calls I figured it out for the doctor the next morning, and\r\nas I recall the statistics, in the course of that day I ate one hundred\r\nand twenty-nine pickled oysters, thirteen plates of chicken salad, seven\r\nplates of lobster salad, five plates of mulled sardines, twenty-three\r\nplates of ice-cream, four hundred and sixty-three macaroons,\r\neighty-seven sandwiches ranging from lettuce and ham to chicken and\r\npotted goose-liver, enough angel-cake to feed all the angels there are\r\nand two more, sixteen Welsh rarebits that were being made just as I\r\nhappened in, and crystallized ginger and salted almonds and marrons to\r\nthe extent of about eighteen pounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mercy!\" cried Mrs. Pedagog.\r\n\r\n\"Say, pa, where was I then?\" asked Tommy, his eyes glittering with\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\n\"You were eating green cheese on the moon, Tommy,\" said the Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"Wisht I'd been with you,\" said Tommy. \"Must o' been better than bein' a\r\npie.\"\r\n\r\n\"And all of these things,\" continued the Idiot, with a wink at his son,\r\n\"I washed down with six gallons of lemonade, nineteen cups of coffee,\r\neighteen cups of tea, and a taste of claret punch.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how about the egg-nog?\" asked the Bibliomaniac, slyly.\r\n\r\n\"I judge there were about six crates of eggs in it,\" said the Idiot. \"I\r\nnever had the nerve to estimate the nog-end of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did the doctor say when you told him all that?\" asked Mrs.\r\nPedagog.\r\n\r\nThe Idiot chuckled. \"What did he say?\" he cried. \"Why, I should think\r\nyou could guess. He blamed it all on the Welsh rarebits, but he thought\r\nhe could get me into shape again in time for the next New Year. I've\r\nnever been the same man since.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the way I look at it,\" said Mrs. Pedagog, \"is that it is a great\r\npity that women must be deprived of a function that gives them pleasure\r\nbecause the men make pigs of themselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you don't understand, Mrs. Pedagog,\" the Idiot persisted. \"I grant\r\nyou that the man who eats all that makes a pig of himself, but he has no\r\nchoice. He can't help himself. When a charming hostess insists, he'd be\r\na greater pig if he refused to partake of her hospitality. The custom\r\ninvolved an inevitable sacrifice of man's digestion upon the altar of\r\nwoman. That's all there was about it. If it could have been arranged so\r\nthat a man could take a hamper about with him and stow all the cakes and\r\nsalads and other good things away in that, and eat them later as he\r\nhappened to need or want them, instead of in his own inner self, the\r\ngood old custom might have been preserved, but that is impossible in\r\nthese conventional days.\"\r\n\r\n\"You needn't have eaten it all,\" put in Mrs. Idiot. \"You could have\r\npretended to eat it and put it down somewhere.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'I FOUND EIGHT SANDWICHES AND A PINT OF SALTED\r\nALMONDS'\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'THEY WERE FOUND SOME DAYS LATER WHEN THE ROOM WAS PUT\r\nIN ORDER'\"]\r\n\r\n\"I know that, my dear. I didn't even on that occasion eat it all--I only\r\nate what I told you. I found eight sandwiches and a pint of salted\r\nalmonds in my coat-tail pocket the next morning, which I managed\r\nsurreptitiously to hide away while my hostesses were getting me\r\nsomething else, and in one place, while nobody was watching me, I hid a\r\nhalf-dozen pickled oysters under a sofa, where I suppose they were found\r\nsome days later when the room was put in order.\"\r\n\r\nAs the Idiot spoke the clock struck twelve, and the guests all rose up.\r\n\r\n\"Here's to the New Year!\" said Mr. Pedagog.\r\n\r\n\"Not yet,\" interposed the Idiot. \"That's only a signal for the Welsh\r\nrarebits to be brought in. I've sworn them off for the New Year, but I\r\nhaven't for the old. The clock is a half-hour fast.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, my dear,\" said Mrs. Idiot. \"It was, but I put it back. It's exactly\r\nright now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said the Idiot, \"I join you in the toast, Mr. Pedagog. Here's to\r\nthe New Year: may it bring joy to everybody. Meanwhile may it bring also\r\nthe Welsh rarebits.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you'd sworn off,\" suggested Mr. Pedagog.\r\n\r\n\"So I had,\" replied the Idiot, \"but circumstances over which I have no\r\ncontrol force me to postpone my reformation for another twelve months.\r\nIf they had been served at half-past eleven I should have stuck to my\r\nresolve; as they have been delayed until twelve-one I cannot do less\r\nthan eat them. I do not believe in wilful waste; and besides, it is\r\nquite as much the duty of the host to consume the good things he places\r\nbefore his guests as it is for the guests to partake. I can wait a year,\r\nI think, without wholly ruining what little digestion my former devotion\r\nto New-Year's calling has left me. Gentlemen, I propose the ladies: May\r\ntheir future be as golden as this rarebit; and for the men, may they\r\nalways be worthy to be the toast upon which that golden future may rest\r\nwith the certainty born of confidence.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the guests fell to and ate each a golden buck to the New Year--all\r\nsave Mollie and Tommy. These two important members of the household went\r\nup to their little beds, but just before going to sleep Tommy called\r\nthrough the door to his little sister:\r\n\r\n\"Mollie!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeth!\"\r\n\r\n\"Want to play a game with me to-morrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeth!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you get a cake and a pie and some gingersnaps and a lot of apples\r\nand some candy and we'll play New-Year's calls.\"\r\n\r\n\"Splendid!\" lisped Mollie. \"You'll call on me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Tommy; \"and all you'll have to do will be to force food on\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nAnd they soon passed into the land of dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nSOME DOMESTIC INVENTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'THERE'S NOT MUCH MONEY IN STOCKS'\"]\r\n\r\n\"I think I'll give up the business of broking and go into inventing,\"\r\nsaid the Idiot one Sunday morning, as he and Mrs. Idiot and their\r\nfriends sat down at breakfast. \"There's not much money in stocks, but\r\nthe successful inventor of a patent clothes-pin makes a fortune.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd think twice about that before acting,\" observed Mr. Brief. \"There\r\nmay not be much money in stocks, but you can work eight hours a day, and\r\nget good pay in a broker's office, while the inventor has to wait upon\r\ninspiration.\"\r\n\r\n\"True enough,\" said the Idiot; \"but waiting on inspiration isn't a bad\r\nbusiness in itself. You can play golf or read a rattling good novel, or\r\ngo to a yacht-race while you wait.\"\r\n\r\n\"But where does the money come in?\" asked Mr. Pedagog, his usual\r\ncaution coming to the fore.\r\n\r\n\"Inspiration brings it with her,\" said the Idiot, \"and by the barrel,\r\ntoo. What's the use of toiling eight hours a day for fifty weeks in a\r\nyear for three thousand dollars when by waiting on inspiration in a\r\npleasant way you make a million all of a sudden?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Pedagog, indulgently, \"if you have the inspiration\r\nlassoed, as you might say, your argument is all right; but if you are\r\nmerely going to sit down and wait for it to ring you up on the\r\ntelephone, and ask you when and where you wish your barrels of gold\r\ndelivered, I think it will be your creditors, and not fortune, who will\r\nbe found knocking at your door. How are you going about this business,\r\nprovided you do retire from Wall Street?\"\r\n\r\n\"Choose my field and work it,\" replied the Idiot. \"For the present I\r\nshould choose the home. That is the field I am most interested in just\r\nnow. I should study its necessities, and endeavor to meet whatever these\r\nmight demand with an adequate supply. Any man who stays around home all\r\nday will find lots of room for the employment of his talents along\r\ninventive lines.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've tried it, have you?\" asked Mr. Brief.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly I have,\" said the Idiot, \"though I haven't invented anything\r\nyet. Why, only last week I stayed home on Monday--wash-day--and a\r\nthousand things that might be invented suggested themselves to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"As, for instance?\" asked Mrs. Idiot, who was anxious to know of any\r\npossible thing that could mitigate the horrors of wash-day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'A NICE LITTLE BASKET-HAT ON HER HEAD TO HOLD THE PINS\r\nIN'\"]\r\n\r\n\"Well, it wouldn't help _you_ much, my dear,\" said the Idiot, \"but the\r\nwash-lady would hail with unmixed delight a substitute for her mouth to\r\nhold clothes-pins in while she is hanging out the clothes. I watched\r\nEllen in the yard for ten minutes that day, and it was pathetic. There\r\nshe was, standing on her tiptoes, hanging innumerable garments on the\r\nline, her mouth full of clothes-pins, and Jimpsonberry's hired man\r\nleaning over the fence trying to shout sweet nothings in her ear. If she\r\nhad had a nice little basket-hat on her head to hold the pins in she\r\ncould have answered back without stopping her work every other minute\r\nto take them out of her mouth in order to retort to his honeyed\r\nsentiments.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Idiot laughed. \"Ellen finds time enough to talk and do the washing,\r\ntoo,\" she said. \"I sometimes think she does more talking than washing.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt of it; she's only human, like the rest of us,\" said the Idiot.\r\n\"But she might save time to do something else for us if she could do the\r\nwashing and the talking at the same time. She may give up the washing,\r\nbut she'll never give up the talking. Therefore, why not make the\r\ntalking easier?\"\r\n\r\n\"What you need most, I think,\" put in Mr. Brief, \"is an instrument to\r\nkeep hired men from leaning over the fence and distracting the attention\r\nof the laundress from her work. That would be a great boon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not unless idleness is a great boon,\" retorted the Idiot. \"Half the\r\nhired men I know would be utterly out of employment if they couldn't\r\nlean over a fence and talk to somebody. Leaning over a fence and talking\r\nto somebody forms seventy-five per cent. of the hired man's daily labor.\r\nHe seems to think that is what he is paid for. Still, any one who\r\nobjects could very easily remedy the conversational detail in so far as\r\nit goes on over the fence.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the use of barbed wire, I presume,\" suggested Mr. Pedagog.\r\n\r\n\"By something far more subtle and delicately suggestive,\" rejoined the\r\nIdiot. \"Hired men do not mind barbed-wire fences. They rather like them\r\nwhen they annoy other people. When they annoy themselves they know how\r\nto treat them. My own man Mike, for instance, minds them not at all.\r\nIndeed, he has taken my pruning-shears and clipped all the barbs off the\r\nsmall stretch of it we had at the rear end of our lot to keep him from\r\nclimbing over for a short cut home.\"\r\n\r\n\"With what result?\" asked Mr. Brief.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'AN ELECTRIC NOTICE TO QUIT'\"]\r\n\r\n\"With the result that I had to buy a new pair of pruning-shears,\" said\r\nthe Idiot. \"My Anti-Over-the-Fence-Gabber,\" he continued, \"would involve\r\ncertain complex details, but it would work. I should have an electric\r\nbattery connected with the upper cable of the fence, and an operator\r\nstationed inside of the house, close to a key which would send some\r\nsix hundred or seven hundred volts through the cable whenever needed.\r\nThen if I felt that Jimpsonberry's man was interfering with my\r\nlaundress, as soon as he leaned over the fence I'd have the operator\r\nsend him an electric notice to quit.\"\r\n\r\n\"A message?\" said Mr. Pedagog.\r\n\r\n\"No, a plain shock. Two hundred volts as a starter, three hundred as a\r\nreminder, and the full seven hundred if necessary to make the hint\r\nplainer.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would be cruel,\" observed Mrs. Pedagog.\r\n\r\n\"Not wholly,\" said the Idiot. \"It would be an advantage to the man\r\nhimself in one way. Hired men have too little electricity in their\r\nsystems, Mrs. Pedagog. If Jimpsonberry's man, for instance, would take\r\nall the electricity I'd give him and apply it to his work,\r\nJimpsonberry's unpulled dandelions would not be such a constant menace\r\nto my lawn. I compel Mike to weed out my lawn every spring and autumn,\r\nbut Jimpsonberry doesn't attend to his at all. He doesn't sleep on it,\r\nand so doesn't bother about it. Consequently, when his dandelions go to\r\nseed the seed is blown over into my grass, and every year I get an\r\nuninvited crop, which at a dollar a thousand would make me a\r\nmillionaire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you apply your inventive genius to the discovery of a\r\nseedless dandelion?\" asked the Lawyer. \"It seems to me that would be the\r\nbest solution of the dandelion problem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because Jimpsonberry wouldn't have 'em if I discovered 'em,\" said the\r\nIdiot. \"I judge from the millions he raises every year that he is\r\nsatisfied with dandelions as they are. He's got enough for himself, and\r\nnever makes any charge for those he gives to his neighbors.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think a furnace-feeder would be a good thing, too,\" the Idiot\r\ncontinued, in a moment. \"My furnace is a chronic sufferer from\r\nindigestion because on some days it is gorged with coal and on others\r\nwith ashes. Seems to me if I could get a month's time in which to\r\nconcentrate my attention upon a furnace-feeder, I could devise some kind\r\nof a contraption that would invoke the enthusiastic love of the suburban\r\nresident in Arctic latitudes the world over.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have often thought of that possibility myself,\" observed Mr. Pedagog,\r\nhis eyes fondly resting upon a steaming plate of griddle-cakes that\r\nhad just been brought in. \"But coal is a rebellious quantity. A\r\nfurnace-feeder would need to be delicately adjusted, and coal cannot be\r\nhandled with delicacy. It requires a chute rather than a tube. It must\r\nbe manipulated with the shovel, not the sugar-tongs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Correct,\" said the Idiot. \"Therefore, _you_ would experiment on a chute\r\nor a shovel, abandoning all idea of refining the coal. I, on the other\r\nhand, would experiment with the coal itself, Mr. Pedagog. Why not\r\nliquefy it, and let it drop automatically into the furnace through a\r\nself-acting spigot?\"\r\n\r\n\"Liquefy coal?\" asked Mr. Pedagog.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" replied the Idiot. \"We liquefy pretty nearly everything\r\nelse. If liquid air, why not liquid coal? Everything we have in nature\r\nin these days apparently can be liquefied, and while I am not familiar\r\nwith the process, I see no reason why a ton of coal should not be\r\nreduced to such a shape that it can be bottled. Once bottled and\r\nprovided with an automatic dropper, it could easily be adjusted so as to\r\nflow in proper quantities into the furnace at proper intervals.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be very expensive. Do you know what a pint of liquid air\r\ncosts?\" demanded the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the Idiot. \"I neither breathe nor drink it. The plain old\r\nstuff is good enough for me, and cheap if you don't have to go to the\r\nmountains or the sea-shore to get your supply.\"\r\n\r\n\"Granting coal could be liquefied,\" the Doctor assented, \"I venture to\r\nsay that a ton of it would cost as much as five hundred dollars.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've no doubt it would,\" said the Idiot; \"but I could afford a ton of\r\ncoal at five hundred dollars if my scheme worked. A successful invention\r\nwould make bread seem cheap at ten dollars a loaf. There's another thing\r\nI should put my mind on, and that is a method of cooking a cauliflower\r\nso that everybody in the house, as well as the neighbors, should not\r\nknow that you are doing so,\" he continued. \"I am particularly fond of\r\ncauliflower, but it is undeniable that in the process of cooking it\r\nbecomes obtrusive, almost to the point of ostentation. I've spoken about\r\nit many times. Mike, the gardener, to whom I've spoken on the subject,\r\nthinks the cauliflower itself, if sprinkled with _eau de Cologne_ while\r\ngrowing, would cease to be obnoxious in the cooking; but that is too\r\nexpensive a process. It would take a dozen cases of _eau de Cologne_ to\r\nbring a single cauliflower to maturity. My son, Tommy, has stated that\r\nhe thinks it might be boiled in Florida-water instead of in the simple\r\nvariety that comes from the pipes. A good suggestion for a small boy,\r\nbut also expensive. Hired men and small boys do not think of the\r\nexchequer of the principal in their plans. They don't have to. Their\r\nallowance and wages are usually all velvet--an elegant vulgarism for\r\nsurplus--and for my own part I have constantly to veto their little\r\nschemes for the betterment of my condition in order to have any\r\ncondition at all left. But as far as the arrangement of an odorless\r\ncauliflower-cooker is concerned, it is as simple as A B C, barring one\r\nor two complications.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you'd hurry up and invent it,\" cried Mrs. Idiot, with\r\nenthusiasm. \"What are the main features of this simple contrivance?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd have a boiler, in the first place, in which to boil the animal,\"\r\nsaid the Idiot. \"When the water was ready I'd clap the creature into it,\r\nand before it had time to remonstrate I'd fasten a hermetically sealed\r\ncover over the top.\"\r\n\r\n\"But when you took it off the results would still be overpowering,\" said\r\nMr. Pedagog.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'FINDING OUT WHAT IS BEING COOKED FOR DINNER'\"]\r\n\r\n\"No, my dear sir,\" said the Idiot, \"for the simple reason that I should\r\naffix a cold-air box and a flue to the hermetically sealed boiler.\r\nThrough the cold-air box fresh air would constantly flow into the\r\nboiler. Through the flue all the aromatic drawbacks of the cauliflower\r\nwould be carried off through the chimney into the upper air. Anybody who\r\nwished to know whether we were going to have cauliflower for dinner or\r\nnot would have to climb up to the roof and sniff at the chimney-top to\r\nfind out.\"\r\n\r\n\"It _is_ simple, isn't it, Mrs. Idiot?\" Mrs. Pedagog said.\r\n\r\n\"Very,\" replied Mrs. Idiot. \"Indeed, it seems so extremely simple that I\r\nshould like to know where the complications lie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where all the complications in cooking lie, my dear,\" said the\r\nIdiot, \"in the cook. The chief complication would lie in getting a cook\r\nwho could, or if she could, would, use the thing intelligently.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see,\" said Mr. Brief, dryly--\"I don't see but that what you\r\nought to devote your time to, my dear Idiot, is the invention of an\r\nintelligent cook.\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph!\" laughed the Idiot. \"I may be an idiot, Mr. Brief, but I'm not\r\nan ass. There are some things that man may reasonably hope to\r\naccomplish--such as setting fire to the Hudson River, or growing\r\nbutternuts on the summit of Mont Blanc--but as for trying to invent an\r\nintelligent cook who would stay in the country for more than two weeks\r\nfor less than ten thousand dollars a year, that, sir, is beyond all the\r\nconceptions of the human mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ain't Bridget intelligent, pa?\" asked Tommy.\r\n\r\nHere was a complication, for Tommy liked to retail to Bridget the gossip\r\nof the day, and especially what \"pa said.\"\r\n\r\n\"H'm--ah--oh yes, indeed, she is, Tommy,\" the Idiot replied, with some\r\nembarrassment. \"Very; she's been with us three months.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much do you pay her, pa?\" asked the boy.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the Idiot, \"not more than fifteen hundred dollars a month.\r\nJust take another griddle-cake, my son, and remember that there are some\r\nthings little boys should not talk about.\"\r\n\r\n\"Like tumpany's bald heads?\" lisped Mollie, complacently, her eye fixed\r\nupon Mr. Pedagog's shining dome.\r\n\r\n\"Precisely,\" observed Mr. Pedagog, appreciating the situation.\r\n\r\nAnd while everybody else laughed the Idiot looked upon his children with\r\na sternly affectionate face.\r\n\r\n\"My dear,\" said he to Mrs. Idiot, \"I think it is time the babies got\r\nready for Sunday-school.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nA SUBURBAN COMPLICATION\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Well, old chap,\" said the Poet some weeks later, when he happened to be\r\nspending the night off in the suburbs with his old friend, \"how goes the\r\nnoble art of inventing? Has your horseless cauliflower bloomed as yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Horseless cauliflower is good, but tautological,\" said the Idiot. \"The\r\ncauliflower is an automobile in itself, without the intervention of man.\r\nWho told you I was inventing instead of broking these days?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Pedagog said something about it the last time I met him,\" said the\r\nPoet. \"He's a mighty good friend of yours. He says you are the most\r\nperfect Idiot he ever met.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's a bully good fellow,\" said the Idiot, affectionately. \"You know I\r\nused to think Pedagog wasn't of any earthly use except to teach people\r\nthings, but as I look back upon my experience with him he has never\r\ntaught me anything that was worth forgetting. So he told you I was going\r\ninto invention, did he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; and he said he thought you were going about it in the right way,\"\r\nrejoined the Poet. \"You weren't spending ten thousand dollars to get a\r\nfour-dollar invention on the market, he said, but were inventing things\r\nthat you knew at the outset weren't worth risking your money on.\"\r\n\r\nThe Idiot smiled broadly.\r\n\r\n\"He said that, did he? Well, he doesn't know what he is talking about,\"\r\nhe retorted. \"I am spending money on my inventions. I have already\r\ninvested fifty cents in my patent Clothes-Pin-Holding Laundry-Bonnet,\r\nand I have strung the wires along my fence to be used in my electric\r\nHired-Man-Discourager; and when I have managed to save up a few dollars\r\nmore I'm going to get a battery to attach to it, when woe betide that\r\nman of Jimpsonberry's if he tries to talk to Maria while she is at work!\r\nFurthermore, I have extended the operations of that same useful\r\ninvention so that it will meet a long-felt want in all suburban\r\ncommunities as a discourager of promiscuous wooing. You never lived\r\nin the country, did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not permanently,\" said the Poet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'COURTING HIS BEST GIRL ON SOME OTHER FELLOW'S STONE\r\nWALL'\"]\r\n\r\n\"Then you are not aware of a singular habit the young country swain has\r\nof courting his best girl on some other fellow's stone wall after the\r\nsun goes down,\" said the Idiot. \"Some balmy evening next spring, if\r\nyou'll come up here I'll show you one of the features of suburban life\r\nthat will give you an idea for a poem. That stone wall that runs along\r\nthe front of my place has been the scene of more engagements than I can\r\ntell you of. Many a time when I have come home late at night I have\r\ncounted as many as ten couples sitting on the cold coping of that wall\r\ntelling each other how beautiful the world is, and holding each other on\r\nwith loving arms.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather an affecting scene, that,\" said the Poet.\r\n\r\n\"It was at first,\" rejoined the Idiot, \"and I rather liked to see it.\r\nIndeed, I once suggested to Mrs. Idiot that we should have the coping\r\nupholstered, so that they might sit more comfortably. I even wanted to\r\nput a back along the inner side of it for them to lean against, but\r\nafter a while it palled. We couldn't sit out on our own front porch on\r\na summer evening and talk without sentimental interruptions that were\r\ndemoralizing to a sustained conversation. We'd try to talk, for\r\ninstance, about Browning, or Tennyson, or Le Gallienne, or some other\r\npoet of their class, when we'd be interrupted by such sentiments as,\r\n'Ess I is,' and 'I's oo ducky,' and 'Ain't de moon boofer?' Then when we\r\nhad guests we never dared to take them out-of-doors, but remained cooped\r\nup inside the house, because Mrs. Idiot feared to intrude upon the\r\nsacred right of those ten couples to do their courting comparatively\r\nunobserved.\"\r\n\r\n\"It must have been a nuisance,\" said the Poet.\r\n\r\n\"It grew to be so; but I hadn't the heart to stop it, even if I could\r\nhave done so, so I put up a hedge to hide them from view and soften the\r\nsound of their voices; but it didn't work very long. They didn't seem to\r\nappreciate my motive, and it so happened that the hedge which I put up\r\nwith the most innocent of intentions was a Japanese quince that blossoms\r\nout in thorns half an inch long, to an extent which suggests the fretful\r\nporcupine. These, for some reason or other, excited the animosity of\r\nmy twenty young friends on the wall, and at the end of the season there\r\nwere not two consecutive feet of the hedge that had not been hacked and\r\ncut to pieces by my indignant but uninvited guests.\"\r\n\r\n\"What impudence!\" cried the Poet.\r\n\r\n\"Only the ardor of youth,\" observed the Idiot, calmly. \"Put yourself in\r\nthe same place. Suppose that you, just as you were about to declare your\r\nundying love for the girl of your choice, and while gently stealing your\r\narm about her waist, were to have the back of your hand ripped off by a\r\nbrutal hedge?\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" laughed the Poet. \"I dare say I should be indignant.\"\r\n\r\n\"They were properly so,\" said the Idiot, \"properly so; and neither Mrs.\r\nIdiot nor I really blamed them.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'HOLDING UP A GREAT OSAGE ORANGE'\"]\r\n\r\n\"We let the matter rest, and made no complaint,\" he continued. \"Time\r\nwent on, and the courters became a trifle more assertive. One of them\r\ncame into the house one evening and demanded to know what I meant by\r\nassaulting him and his lady friend, holding up a great Osage orange\r\nwhich he alleged to have been the murderous weapon I had used; and I\r\nreally had to apologize, for I was guilty. It happened that while\r\nwalking about my small preserves I had picked up this orange, which had\r\nfallen onto my lawn from a tree on Jimpsonberry's place, and had\r\nunthinkingly tried to see how far I could throw it. It went just over\r\nthe hedge, and had unceremoniously knocked Strephon's hat into the\r\nmiddle of next week and frightened Phyllis into hysterics. I was placed\r\non the defensive, but for the life of me I couldn't help laughing, with\r\nthe result that Strephon stalked angrily away, alleging that I should\r\nhear from him further in the matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"And did you?\" asked the Poet.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the Idiot, \"I never did; but the incident rather soured me\r\ntowards the people who seemed to regard my stone wall as their property.\r\nI even came to feel like purchasing a gatling-gun and loading it with\r\nOsage oranges for the purpose of repelling them, but even under this\r\nprovocation I still continued to ignore the matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are too easy-going,\" suggested the Poet.\r\n\r\n\"I was,\" said the Idiot, \"until they began to use the sidewalk that runs\r\nparallel with the wall as a tablet upon which to inscribe in letters\r\nof flame their undying affection. One Sunday morning, as Mrs. Idiot and\r\nI started for church, we were horrified to find our flagstones scribbled\r\nall over with poetry, done in chalk, after the order of\r\n\r\n  \"Roses is pink, and violets is blue,\r\n  Sugar is sweet, and so be you.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'THE PICTURE OF A HEART WITH AN ARROW DRAWN THROUGH\r\nIT'\"]\r\n\r\n\"Further along was the picture of a heart with an arrow drawn through\r\nit, and the two names 'Larry' and 'Mame' written on either side. And one\r\nunusually affectionate youth had actually cut the initials of his young\r\nlady and himself in the top of the coping, with a cold-chisel, I\r\nsuspect. It's there yet. It was then my spirit rose up into fierce\r\ndenunciation. That night, when the clans had gathered and were going\r\nthrough the initial stages I marched out in front of them, cleared my\r\nthroat ostentatiously, and made a speech. It was the most nervous speech\r\nI ever made; worse than after-dinner speaking by a good deal. I called\r\ntheir attention to how I had suffered: referred pathetically to the\r\ndestruction of the hedge; inveighed sarcastically against the\r\nOsage-orange man; told them in highly original fashion that worms, if\r\ntaken at the ebb that leads on to fortune, would surely turn and rend\r\ntheir persecutors, and that I'd had enough. I forgave them the hedge; I\r\nforgave them the annoyance they had cost me, but I asserted that I'd see\r\nthem all condemned to eternal celibacy before I would permit my sidewalk\r\nto be turned into an anthology of love, and my coping into an intaglio\r\nof eternal blessedness. I requested them if they wished to write poetry\r\nto write it upon their own hearths, and if they had any inscriptions to\r\ncut to chip in and buy an obelisk of their own and hieroglyph to their\r\nhearts' content. I even offered to buy them each a slate and pencil,\r\nwhich they might bring with them when they came, upon which to send\r\ntheir sentiments down to posterity, and I finished with what I consider\r\nto be a pleasing perversion of Longfellow's poem on the Woodman, with a\r\nfew lines beginning:\r\n\r\n  \"Scribbler, spare that sidewalk.\r\n\r\n\"Then I departed, threatening to have them all arrested.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" said the Poet. \"I didn't think you'd ever do it. You have nerve\r\nenough, but you are too good-natured.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't good-natured then,\" said the Idiot, regretfully; \"and when I\r\ngot through I stalked back into the house, scolded Mollie, sent Tommy to\r\nbed, and behaved like a bear for the rest of the evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the people on the wall? They slunk away in despair, I suppose,\"\r\nsaid the Poet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'IT TOOK MY HIRED MAN TWO WEEKS TO SCRUB IT OUT'\"]\r\n\r\n\"Not they,\" said the Idiot; \"not by a long shot. They combined against\r\nme, and next morning when I started for town I found my sidewalk in\r\nworse shape than ever. One flag had written upon it the pleasing mandate\r\n'Go drown yourself.' Another bore the mystic word 'Chump' in great\r\ncapital letters, and at the end of my walk was a pastel portrait of\r\nmyself, of rough and awkward composition, labelled with my name in full.\r\nIt took my hired man two weeks to scrub it out. And on the following\r\nHallowe'en they strung a huge banner on my telephone wires, inscribed\r\n'The Idiot Asylum,' and every blessed gate I have to my name had been\r\nremoved from the premises.\"\r\n\r\n\"What an outrage!\" cried the Poet.\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit of it. Merely a suburban ebullition,\" said the Idiot. \"They\r\ndon't mean anything by it. They are mere children, after all, and from\r\ntheir point of view I have interfered with their rights.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you propose to stand all this?\" asked the Poet. \"If I were you I'd\r\nget a pile of broken bottles, as they do in England, and place them\r\nalong the top of that wall so that they couldn't possibly use it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Brutal custom, that,\" said the Idiot. \"May do for Englishmen; won't do\r\nhere at all. In the first place, it spoils the appearance of the wall;\r\nin the second place, it is not efficacious; in the third place, it would\r\nplace me in a false position. Everybody'd soon be asking where I got all\r\nthose bottles. An Englishman drinks enough beer in the course of a week\r\nto keep his walls covered with broken bottles for a century. I don't,\r\nand I'm not going to buy bottles. I've got a better scheme.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" cried the Poet. \"Now we are coming to the invention.\"\r\n\r\n\"Merely an extension of my 'Hired-Man-Discourager,'\" said the Idiot.\r\n\"Simple, and I trust efficacious. I am going to put a live wire along\r\nthe coping of my wall. Broken bottles are cheap, my dear Poet, but\r\nthey don't work. If I put broken bottles on my wall the Amalgamated\r\nBrotherhood of Wooers would meet on my lawn and pass resolutions against\r\nme, and ultimately they would demand the use of my parlor, unless I\r\nmisunderstand their nature.\r\n\r\n\"The lovers' rights must be respected always, and I'm truly thankful\r\nthat they have stopped short at my frontage. When they operate along my\r\nfrontier-line they are harmless, interesting, even amusing. If they\r\ncarry their principles through and penetrate beyond the edge, why, then\r\nMrs. Idiot and I will have to give it up.\r\n\r\n\"My scheme is to make them feel that they are welcome to the wall, but\r\nto make the wall--well, to give an element of surprise to the wall. Just\r\nas Jimpsonberry's man is soon to be surprised electrically, which is\r\nlegitimately, so do I propose to surprise these inconsiderate persons\r\nwho cut down my hedges, who scribble up my sidewalk with their poems,\r\nand who hang Hallowe'en banners on my telephone wires. I wish them all\r\nwell, but next spring when they attempt to revive the customs of the\r\npast they will find that even I am resentful.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall have a wire running along the coping, as I have already said,\r\nthat between the hours of eight and twelve p.m. will be so full of\r\nshocking things that my uninvited guests will cease to bother me. Can\r\nyou imagine the effect of a live wire upon ten loving couples engaged in\r\nlooking at the moon while sitting on it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet you claim to insist upon their rights as lovers,\" said the Poet,\r\ndeprecatingly.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly I do,\" said the Idiot. \"Man has a right to make love wherever\r\nhe can. If he can't make love on my wall, let him make love somewhere\r\nelse.\"\r\n\r\n\"But where?\" cried the Poet. \"Your swains up here have no home,\r\napparently.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or Jimpsonberry's wall,\" said the Idiot. \"By the way, do you know\r\nanything about moths?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nSOME CONSIDERATION OF THE MOTH\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Do you know anything about the habits of moths?\" repeated the Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"Moths?\" echoed the Poet, eying the Idiot closely, the transition from\r\nlive wires to moths proving rather too sudden for his comprehension.\r\n\"No, I don't know anything about moths except that I have heard that\r\nthey are an unmitigated nuisance.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are worse than a nuisance,\" said the Idiot. \"They are a devouring\r\nelement, and they are worse than fire. If your house catches fire you\r\ncan summon an engine and have it put out, and what damage it does you\r\ncan collect for if you are careful enough to keep your possessions\r\ninsured; but with the moth it is different. There isn't any moth\r\ndepartment in town that you can ring up, nor is there a\r\nmoth-extinguisher that you can keep close at hand to fight them with.\r\nFurthermore, there is no moth-insurance company here or elsewhere to\r\nprotect the man who suffers damage at their teeth, that I know of.\r\n\r\n\"He is a mean, sneaking, underhanded element, the moth is. Fire has a\r\ndecent sense of the proprieties. Moths have none at all. When fire\r\nattacks you it smokes, and crackles, and hisses, and roars, and lets you\r\nknow in clarion tones that it has come. The moth steals upon you in the\r\ndead of night, and chews up your best trousers, gorges himself upon your\r\nwife's furs, tickles his palate with your swellest flannel golf-shirt,\r\nmunches away upon your handsomest rug, punches holes in your best\r\nsofa-cushions with his tusks, and then silently folds his tent and\r\nsteals away without so much as a thank-you for his meal. For unmitigated\r\nmeanness commend me to the moth!\"\r\n\r\n\"You seem to speak with feeling,\" said the Poet, with a smile. \"Have you\r\nsuffered?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'AN UNPAID GROCER'S BILL BECOMES AN ABSOLUTE PLEASURE'\"]\r\n\r\n\"Suffered?\" cried the Idiot. \"Suffered is not the word. They have\r\ntortured me. Alongside of the moth and his nefarious work even a\r\nbook-agent pales into insignificance, and an unpaid grocer's bill\r\nbecomes an absolute pleasure. You can meet a book-agent on his own\r\nground, for you know his limitations. I have done so myself. Only\r\nyesterday one of them called upon me to sell me a Cyclopedia of Cookery,\r\nand before he got away I had actually sold him a copy of your poems.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said the Poet, shaking his head. \"You sold my gift, did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit of it,\" laughed the Idiot. \"When your book came out I bought\r\na copy, and two days later you sent me another with an inscription,\r\nwhich I treasure affectionately. I sold him the one I bought.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a beautiful Idiot,\" said the Poet, slapping his knee\r\nenthusiastically.\r\n\r\n\"I don't lay claim so much to beauty as to sublimity,\" said the Idiot,\r\nlighting a cigar. \"And even that is not to my credit. Beauty and\r\nsublimity are gifts. No amount of cultivation can produce genius when it\r\ndoes not exist. When I see a beautiful woman it is not she that I\r\nadmire. I admire the gracious Hand that made her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me that idea, old man!\" cried the Poet.\r\n\r\n\"It is yours from this on,\" said the Idiot, with a sigh. \"I am not equal\r\nto it. I may be able to think thoughts, but thoughts are of no more use\r\nto me than a piano is to a man who can't read music. But we are becoming\r\ndiscursive. We were talking about moths, not thoughts. You said that I\r\nmust have suffered, and I said that I had been tortured, and I have. My\r\nevening clothes have been ruined by them; my best shirts have been eaten\r\nby them; my silk hat, in which I have taken much pride, has four bald\r\nspots on its side because of their insatiable appetite, and as far as I\r\ncan find out, I have no redress. You can't sue a moth for damages, you\r\nknow, with any degree of satisfaction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should you expect to sue a moth for damages any more than to have a\r\nmosquito indicted for assault?\" suggested the Poet.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, as for that,\" said the Idiot, \"you can treat the mosquito without\r\nmuch difficulty. He merits capital punishment, and if you are yourself\r\nalert you can squash him at the moment of his crime. But the moth is\r\ndifferent. You are absolutely helpless in the face of him. He works\r\nin secret.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am told that there are such things as camphor-balls,\" observed the\r\nPoet.\r\n\r\n\"There are,\" said the Idiot. \"And I truly think the moth enjoys them as\r\nmuch as a young girl enjoys a military ball. Whenever we give a\r\ncamphor-ball the moths attend, and as far as I can find out dance all\r\nthrough it. They seem to enjoy functions of that nature. Furthermore, I\r\nhave yet to meet the man who likes to go about in a suit of clothes that\r\nsmells like a drug-store. I don't. I hate the odor of camphor, and if I\r\nhave my choice of going to a dinner in a perforated dress-suit or in one\r\nthat is redolent of the camphor-ball, I prefer the one with holes in it.\r\nWhat I can't understand is why a race as proud as the one to which you\r\nand I belong should have to knuckle under to an inferior lot of insects\r\nsuch as the moth represents.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'THE LION, THE ELEPHANT, THE TIGER, ALL HAVE THEIR WORK\r\nTO DO'\"]\r\n\r\n\"I suppose there is something about it that we cannot understand,\" said\r\nthe Poet, dreamily. \"All created things have their uses. The lion, the\r\nelephant, the tiger, the boa-constrictor, all have their work to do in\r\nlife. Even the mosquito has his mission, whatever it may be. You must\r\nadmit this. Why not, therefore, admit that the moth serves a purpose in\r\nthe great scheme of life?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Poet,\" said the Idiot, \"far be it from me to deny the truth of\r\nwhat you say. There is hardly a living creature that I have ever\r\nencountered in all my life that has not had some truly utilitarian\r\nquality in its make-up. The lion is a splendid creature, and with the\r\nbear and the fox and the rhinoceros and the tapir he serves a purpose.\r\nThey at least teach boys geography, and teach it interestingly. The boy\r\nwho knows where the tapir hath its lair knows more geography than I do.\r\nMy son Tommy has learned more of geography from a visit to the circus\r\nwhere those animals are shown than he ever learned from books. I can\r\nquite see likewise the utilitarian value of the mosquito. He keeps the\r\nsea-shore from being overcrowded, and he prevents some people from\r\nsleeping too much. He is an accomplished vocalist, and from my own point\r\nof view is superior to a Wagner opera, since Wagner opera puts me to\r\nsleep, while the magnificent discords of the mosquito keep me awake. But\r\nthe moth is beyond me. What his contribution to the public welfare\r\nmay be I cannot reason out, although I have tried.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you find nothing in his favor?\" asked the Poet.\r\n\r\n\"Much,\" replied the Idiot, \"but he has no system. His mission is to eat\r\nold clothes, but he is such a very disgusting glutton that he does not\r\ndiscriminate between old and new, and I have no use for him. If in his\r\nsearch for a meal he would choose the garments of three years ago, which\r\nI ought not to wear because they are so old-fashioned as to make me\r\nconspicuous when I do wear them, it would be all right. But the moth is\r\nno such discriminating person. He is not a lover of old vintages. When\r\nhe calls in a number of his brother moths to dine at his expense he does\r\nnot treat them to an overcoat of '89, or to a dress-suit of '93, or to a\r\nsilk hat laid down in '95. He wants the latest thing, and as far as I\r\ncan find out he gets it. I have just been compelled to lay in a new\r\nstock of under and over clothes because the ones I had have been served\r\nupon his table.\"\r\n\r\n\"The moth must live,\" observed the Poet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'THEY EAT UP MY NEW CLOTHES'\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'WASTED MY ENERGY UPON THE UNRESPONSIVE AIR'\"]\r\n\r\n\"I'm perfectly willing he should if he'll only discriminate,\" retorted\r\nthe Idiot. \"We have enough old clothes in this house, my dear Poet, to\r\ngive a banquet of seventeen courses to six hundred moths every night for\r\nthe next six months. If they would content themselves with that I should\r\nbe satisfied. But they won't. They eat up my new clothes; they destroy\r\nmy new hats; they munch away upon my most treasured golf-vests. That is\r\nwhy I asked you if you knew anything about moths. I am anxious to reform\r\nthem. As you have said, I have gone into inventing, and my inventions\r\nare wholly designed to meet long-felt wants in all households. The man\r\nwho invents a scheme to circumvent or properly to satisfy the appetite\r\nof the moth will find his name indissolubly linked with fame. I have\r\nthought, and thought, and thought about it. The moth must either be\r\ndomesticated or extinguished. I have tried to extinguish him, but\r\nwithout avail. When he has flown forth I have endeavored to punch him in\r\nthe head, and I have wasted my energy upon the unresponsive air. Did you\r\never undertake to punch a moth in the head?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never,\" said the Poet. \"I am not a fighter.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear boy,\" rejoined the Idiot, \"I don't know a hero in real life or\r\nin fiction who could meet a moth on his own ground. I read about Mr.\r\nWillie B. Travers, of New York, who can drive four horses about the\r\narena at the horse show without turning a hair. I read about Emerson\r\nMcJones, of Boston, putting up his face against the administration on a\r\nquestion of national import. I have read of the prowess of Alexander, of\r\nCÃ¦sar, of D'Artagnan, of Bonaparte, and of Teddy Roosevelt, but there\r\nisn't a man among 'em who can fight the moth. You can bombard him with a\r\ngatling-gun loaded to the muzzle with camphor-balls, and he still waves\r\nhis banner defiantly in your face. You may lunge at him with a rapier,\r\nand he jumps lightly aside, and to express his contempt bites a hole in\r\nyour parlor hangings. You can turn the hose on him, and he soars\r\nbuoyantly away out of reach. You can't kill him, because you can't catch\r\nhim. You can't drive him away, and until we go back to the dress of the\r\nknights of old and wear nickel-plated steel clothing, and live in rooms\r\nof solid masonry, we can't starve him out. There is, therefore, only one\r\nthing to do, and that is to domesticate him. If you in the course of\r\nyour investigations into nature have ever discovered any trait in the\r\nmoth that science can lay hold upon, something through which we can\r\nappeal to his better nature, if he has such a thing, you will be\r\nconferring a great boon upon the whole domestic world. What I want to\r\nfind out is if he possesses some particularly well-defined taste; if\r\nthere is any one kind of texture or fabric that he likes better than\r\nanother. If there is such a thing I'll have a brand-new suit made of\r\nthat same material especially for him, furnish a nice comfortable, warm\r\nspot in the attic as a dining-room, and let him feed there forevermore,\r\nwhen and how he pleases. The manners and customs of moths are an open\r\nbook to most of us. His tastes are as mysterious as the ocean's depths.\"\r\n\r\nThe Poet shook his head dubiously. \"I am afraid, my dear Idiot, that you\r\nhave at last tackled a problem that will prove too much for you. How to\r\nget at the point you desire is, I fear, impossible of discovery,\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"It would seem so,\" replied the Idiot. \"But I shall not despair. If the\r\nordinary cook of commerce can be made humanly intelligent I do not see\r\nany reason why we should abandon so comparatively simple a proposition\r\nas the domesticization of the moth.\"\r\n\r\nTommy and Mollie had been listening with great interest, and as the\r\nIdiot finished Mollie observed that she thought the best way to do was\r\nto ask the moth what he liked most, but Tommy had a less conciliatory\r\nplan.\r\n\r\n\"Best thing's to get rid of 'em altogether, pa,\" he said. \"Mollie and\r\nI'll squash 'em for you for fi' cents apiece.\"\r\n\r\nWhich struck the Poet as the most practical idea that had been advanced\r\nduring the discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nSOME CONSIDERATION OF THE BURGLAR\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Are you ever bothered much by burglars off here in the country?\" asked\r\nMr. Pedagog one spring afternoon, as he and the Idiot and the youngsters\r\nstrolled about the Idiot's small farm.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the Idiot. \"They've only visited me twice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only twice, eh?\" observed the Schoolmaster. \"Well, I should think that\r\nwas often enough, considering that you haven't lived here more than a\r\nyear and a half.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was,\" said the Idiot. \"I didn't say I wanted them to come again, did\r\nI?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not,\" returned Mr. Pedagog. \"But you said 'only twice,' as if\r\ntwo visits of that nature were less than might have been expected.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, aren't they?\" asked the Idiot. \"Just make a little calculation.\r\nI've lived on this place precisely five hundred and ninety-four days,\r\nand, of course, an equal number of nights. It seems to me that in\r\nbreaking into my house only twice when they might have come every night\r\nshows a degree of restraint upon our Suburban Burglary Company that is\r\nworthy of the highest commendation. You, of course, refer to\r\nprofessional burglars, don't you?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Pedagog laughed. \"Are there any amateur burglars?\"\r\n\r\n\"Are there!\" ejaculated the Idiot. \"Well, rather. There is the Gasman,\r\nand man who inspects the water-meter, and the Iceman, and the Plumber.\r\nIf you refer to that class, why, I have them with me always.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which of the two classes do you prefer?\" asked Mr. Pedagog, with a\r\nchuckle.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm not quite sure as to that,\" returned the Idiot. \"I've often\r\nwondered myself whether I preferred the straight-out honest pirate, who\r\ndoes his work surreptitiously by night, and who doesn't pretend to be\r\nanything but a pirate, or the sleek, insinuating chap, who comes into\r\nour house by day, and runs up a bill against you which in his heart of\r\nhearts he knows is not a proper one. There are burglars and burglars in\r\nthis world, Mr. Pedagog, and the one who lands in the penitentiary is\r\nnot always a bigger rascal than the fellow who holds the respect of the\r\ncommunity and sets himself up as a prominent citizen. Highwaymen may be\r\ndivided into classes, some of them respectable, others not. There was\r\nDick Turpin, who ran honest risks to obtain a living; there are men in\r\nWall Street who work greater ruin, and are held in higher esteem. There\r\nis the footpad who takes your watch, and pawns it to buy bread for his\r\nstarving family, and there is the very charming young person who sits\r\nbehind a table at a church fair, and charges you seven dollars for a\r\nfifty-cent sofa-cushion. So it goes. Socially I prefer the esteemed\r\ncitizen who makes me pay twenty-eight dollars for ten dollars' worth of\r\ngas; but when it comes down to a strict business basis I must say I have\r\nlost less money through the operations of the professional thief than\r\nthrough those of the amateur highwayman. Take a recent case in my own\r\nexperience, for instance. Only last week I sent anonymously a small\r\nclock which cost me twenty dollars to a guild fair here in town, and\r\nMrs. Idiot bought it for a birthday present for me for forty dollars. In\r\nother words, I have a twenty-dollar clock on my hands that has cost me\r\nsixty dollars.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you have the satisfaction of knowing that you have contributed to\r\nthe good work of the guild,\" suggested Mr. Pedagog.\r\n\r\n\"That is true enough,\" said the Idiot; \"but the guild is only forty\r\ndollars to the good. They'd have been better off if I had given them\r\nfifty dollars in cash, and I'd have saved ten.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you have the clock,\" insisted Mr. Pedagog.\r\n\r\n\"I certainly have,\" replied the Idiot; \"and if time is money I shall\r\nsoon be rich, for that clock makes time to beat the band. If it keeps on\r\nas it has started and we stand by it, we shall soon be about a month\r\nahead of the sun. It gains a week every forty-eight hours. If that clock\r\nwere truthful, I should be a centenarian at forty.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you're not sorry you gave it?\" said Mr. Pedagog, deprecatingly.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" said the Idiot. \"My only regret is that Mrs. I. bought it.\r\nBut,\" he added, hastily, \"she needn't know that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't say a word,\" said Mr. Pedagog.\r\n\r\n\"I won't, neither, pa,\" said Tommy, with a degree of complacency which\r\nshowed that the temptation to tell was great.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I won't say mor'n two or three words about it, anyhow,\" put in\r\nMollie, not anxious to commit herself to perpetual silence on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\"It is the most beautiful clock I ever saw,\" said the Idiot, quickly,\r\nrealizing the possibilities of Mollie's two or three words.\r\n\r\n\"That's what I fink,\" said Mollie, \"and I'm goin' to tell mamma that you\r\nsaid so.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said the Idiot. \"Suppose you and Tommy run right up and\r\ntell her now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd rather hear you talk, pa,\" said Tommy.\r\n\r\n\"He does take after you, doesn't he?\" said Mr. Pedagog.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the Idiot, \"he does. He likes to hear me talk as much as I\r\ndo, bless him!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a commendable sign in a son,\" observed Mr. Pedagog. \"But tell\r\nabout the two professionals. Did they get anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"They did,\" said the Idiot. \"And at the same time I lost nothing. The\r\nfirst chap came on the scene, along about two o'clock in the morning. He\r\nwas a very industrious mechanic, and I regret to say he was not\r\nadequately paid for his services. He tackled the safe.\" At this point\r\nthe Idiot threw back his head and laughed heartily.\r\n\r\n\"I have seen the safe,\" said Mr. Pedagog, \"and to tell you the truth, my\r\ndear Idiot, I have wondered at your choosing so obvious a receptacle for\r\nyour valuables. It does not, to my mind, deny itself as a safe should.\r\nIt advertises the fact that your silver, your wife's jewels perhaps, are\r\nwithin. I have spoken once or twice to our friend Mr. Brief about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt,\" replied the Idiot. \"However, I can't see why a safe has any\r\ndisadvantages.\"\r\n\r\n\"It lies in this,\" said Mr. Pedagog, impressively. \"You confess at once\r\nto the burglar the exact location of the things he's after. Without a\r\nsafe your silver, or Mrs. Idiot's jewels, such as they are, might be\r\nfound anywhere in the house. But when you take the trouble to buy a\r\nsafe, any burglar in creation who has ordinary common-sense must know\r\nthat your valuables are concentrated in that one spot.\"\r\n\r\n\"That, I rejoice to say,\" said the Idiot, \"is the burglar's view.\"\r\n\r\n\"You should not rejoice,\" said Mr. Pedagog, with some of his old-time\r\nseverity. \"You make his work so comparatively easy that he is content to\r\nfollow a base profession, as you have termed it. Truly, I wonder at you.\r\nYou place on your first floor a bald safe--\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't seen any advertised as having a full head of hair,\" observed\r\nthe Idiot, complacently.\r\n\r\n\"You misunderstand me,\" said Mr. Pedagog. \"When I say bald I mean\r\nevident, plain, obvious. You practically say: Here are the things which\r\nI value. What is to be found within this safe, Mr. Burglar, _are the\r\nvery things you are after_. Therefore, say you to the burglar: Attack\r\nthis safe. Break it open, rifle it of its contents; in other words, here\r\nis the swag, as I believe it is called.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are wholly right,\" said the Idiot. \"I bought that safe for that\r\nprecise reason, and I bought a big one and a strong one. But you don't\r\nknow the story of that safe, do you, Mr. Pedagog?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not,\" said the Schoolmaster.\r\n\r\n\"Then let me tell you,\" said the Idiot. \"That safe has been broken open,\r\nand by a professional burglar. The burglar had his tools, and he had\r\nhis expert knowledge of their use. He arrived at my house, as I recall\r\nthe situation, somewhere about--ah--two o'clock at night. He bored at\r\nthe lock until three. He fooled about the combination. He did everything\r\nthat a respectable burglar might be expected to do, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"He failed, of course, since you say you have lost nothing,\" said Mr.\r\nPedagog.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" said the Idiot. \"After two hours and fifty-five minutes'\r\nwork on that safe he got it open. And--\"\r\n\r\n\"And?\" queried Mr. Pedagog.\r\n\r\n\"He found it empty,\" said the Idiot; \"absolutely empty. There was not a\r\nspoon, a fork, a tea-pot, or a diamond necklace, or even a scrap of\r\npaper in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why do you have it,\" said Mr. Pedagog.\r\n\r\n\"Merely to keep the burglar busy while he is in my house, and to make\r\nhim expert in honest work. An ordinary mechanic, intelligent enough to\r\nget that safe open by night or by day, would be entitled to at least two\r\ndollars for his services. The individual involved got it open; and when\r\nhe opened it--\"\r\n\r\n\"Found nothing!\" cried Mr. Pedagog.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly,\" said the Idiot, pulling away on his cigar. \"I suppose I\r\nshould have left a check inside payable to bearer for a dollar and a\r\nhalf to compensate him for his trouble, but I am so neglectful that I\r\nreally didn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you bought a safe--\"\r\n\r\n\"Merely to provide employment for the unemployed burglar,\" said the\r\nIdiot. \"That is all a safe is good for, Mr. Pedagog. Experience has\r\nshown that the house-safe isn't worth the paint it is covered with in\r\nthe matter of protection. But as a decoy it works to a charm. A safe, in\r\nother words, is a splendid thing to keep things out of, as well as to\r\nkeep the burglar busy while he is your guest. If our particular visitor\r\nhad not spent all his time breaking the safe open he might have been\r\nable to locate our spoons.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a pity,\" said Mr. Pedagog, dryly, \"that you did not add to the\r\nimpression the futility of his work made upon his mind a short note of\r\nadmonition indicating to him that he might be in better business.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Mr. Pedagog,\" said the Idiot, \"that would have been rude.\r\nInvited or otherwise, the man was a guest in my house, and a note of\r\nthat kind would have savored of sarcasm, or, if not, would have placed\r\nme in the position of having taken advantage of my guest's weakness to\r\nbe facetious at his expense.\"\r\n\r\n\"You take an original view of it,\" said Mr. Pedagog.\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit of it,\" returned the Idiot. \"I got the idea from a Boston\r\ngirl. Once when she and her sister-in-law found themselves alone at\r\nnight in a huge country-house they were suddenly overcome with fear of\r\nburglars, and rather than run any personal risk from the midnight\r\nmarauder they left a big card on top of the safe inscribed with these\r\nwords: 'Dear Sir,--The combination of this safe is 11-16-91. There is\r\nnothing in it. If you must have our silver, call at the Shawmut Safe\r\nDeposit Company, where it is now stored.' The two girls were cousins of\r\nmine.\"\r\n\r\nThe Schoolmaster smiled again. \"There must be a streak of your\r\nparticular kind of genius running all through your family,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"True--there is,\" said the Idiot. \"I'm not the only Idiot in my tribe.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the second burglar. How about him?\" asked Mr. Pedagog.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he was easy,\" said the Idiot. \"I compromised with him. You see, I\r\nmet him on his way out. I was coming home late, and just as I arrived he\r\nwas leaving. I invited him back, lit the gas in the dining-room, and\r\nasked him to join me in a bit of cold tongue and a bottle of beer. He\r\ntried to shuffle out of it, but when I said I preferred to reason with\r\nhim rather than have him arrested he sat down, and we talked the\r\nsituation over. I discovered that for about three hundred dollars' worth\r\nof my stuff that he had in a bag slung over his shoulder he might get as\r\nmuch as fifty dollars, and at great risk. I showed him how foolish that\r\nwas, and offered to give him forty dollars if he'd leave the stuff, so\r\nsaving me two hundred and sixty dollars, and avoiding all trouble for\r\nhimself. He didn't like it at first, but under the genial influence of\r\nthe beer and the cold tongue and my conversation he finally yielded, and\r\nwalked out of my house with a check drawn to bearer for forty dollars in\r\nhis pocket.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am astonished at you!\" cried Mr. Pedagog. \"You compounded a felony.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly,\" said the Idiot. \"I should have done so if I hadn't\r\nstopped payment on the check the next day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" said Mr. Pedagog, \"I see!\"\r\n\r\n\"All I lost was the revenue-stamp on the check,\" said the Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"And did you ever hear from the man again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" observed the Idiot. \"I met him on the train a day or two\r\nlater--sat next to him in the smoking-car, in fact.\"\r\n\r\n\"And did he know you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. We had a very pleasant chat going to town. He said he was moving\r\naway from here. He couldn't stand it, he said. He was going to work in\r\nsome new field where a man could get living pay for his work. Said he'd\r\nbeen robbed by some of our best people; what's the use of working for\r\nnothing? he asked. The poor man was kept down, and all that sort of\r\ntalk.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you parted friends?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the Idiot. \"I felt rather sorry for him, and when he said\r\ngood-bye I gave him a cigar and a five-dollar bill, and that was the end\r\nof him. I have since received a letter from him in which he said that my\r\nkindness was appreciated, and that I could leave my valuables out on the\r\nlawn all night hereafter with perfect impunity. 'There isn't a thief in\r\nour whole suburban gang would be mean enough to touch it after your\r\nkindness to me,' he wrote.\"\r\n\r\n\"Extraordinary!\" said Mr. Pedagog.\r\n\r\n\"Very,\" said the Idiot. \"Nevertheless, I have not taken his hint about\r\nleaving my silver out-of-doors, and have worked as hard as ever on my\r\npatent burglar-alarm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, indeed! Have you a new idea in that line?\" asked the Schoolmaster.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the Idiot. \"It is wholly novel. It is designed to alarm the\r\nburglar, and not scare the people in the house. Did you ever hear of\r\nanything like that before?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never!\" ejaculated Mr. Pedagog, with enthusiasm. \"How is it to work?\"\r\n\r\n\"That,\" said the Idiot, \"is what I am trying to find out. When I do I'll\r\nlet you know, Doctor.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n  MR. AND MRS. IDIOT\r\n  REQUEST THE PLEASURE OF YOUR COMPANY\r\n  AT DINNER\r\n  ON THURSDAY EVENING, May 31, 1900\r\n  AT HALF-AFTER SEVEN O'CLOCK\r\n  R.S.V.P.       LAST CALL\r\n\r\nHandsomely engraved, a card bearing the above inscription was sent about\r\nthe middle of May to all the Idiot's old friends of Mrs.\r\nSmithers-Pedagog's select home for gentlemen, and it is needless to say\r\nthat they all accepted.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder what the dickens he means by 'Last Call,'\" said Mr. Brief to\r\nthe Genial Old Gentleman who occasionally imbibed. \"Sounds like the\r\nwarning of the dining-car porter on a Pullman train.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I can't imagine,\" said the other; \"and what's more, I'm\r\ncontent to wait and find out. Of course you are going?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am, indeed,\" said Mr. Brief. \"I'd travel farther than that for the\r\npleasure of an hour with the dear old boy, and particularly now that he\r\nhas so good a cook. Dined there lately?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the Genial Old Gentleman.\r\n\r\n\"Had any of those mulled sardines he gives you Sunday nights?\"\r\n\r\n\"More than was good for me. Ain't they fine?\" said the Genial Old\r\nGentleman, smacking his lips ecstatically.\r\n\r\n\"Immense!\" said Mr. Brief. \"A cook that can mull sardines like that is\r\nworth her weight in gold. Where do you suppose he got her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, he married her!\" cried the Genial Old Gentleman, promptly. \"Mrs.\r\nIdiot cooks those herself, on the chafing-dish. Didn't you know that?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Mr. Brief. \"I happened in late Sunday night, and we had 'em.\r\nThey were so awfully good I didn't do a thing but eat, and forgot to\r\nask who cooked 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the way of the world,\" sighed the Genial Old Gentleman. \"We old\r\nbachelors have to get along on what comes to us, but the energetic chap\r\nwho goes out into the world and marries the right sort of a woman--Jove,\r\nwhat a lucky chap he is!\"\r\n\r\n\"There's some truth in that,\" agreed Mr. Brief; \"but, on the whole, just\r\nthink what a terrible thing it would be to marry a bad cook, and to have\r\nto eat everything she prepared with an outward show of delight just to\r\nkeep peace in the family.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's your cautious lawyer's view of it,\" said the Genial Old\r\nGentleman.\r\n\r\n\"Why the deuce don't you get married yourself, then,\" said Mr. Brief.\r\n\"If you feel that way--\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to,\" said the Genial Old Gentleman. \"Fact is, Brief, old\r\nman, all I should ever marry for would be the comfort of a home, and I\r\ncan always get that by going up to the Idiot's.\"\r\n\r\nThe other invited guests were no less perplexed by the final words of\r\nthe Idiot's invitation, and with the pleasure of accepting was mingled\r\nan agreeable curiosity to know what was meant by \"Last Call.\" The\r\nevening came, and all were present. It was a goodly company, and by\r\nspecial favor the children were allowed to sit up and partake; and, what\r\nwas more, Mary, the housemaid of the old days, assisted in the serving\r\nof the dinner.\r\n\r\n\"Seems like old times,\" said Mr. Whitechoker, beaming at Mrs. Pedagog\r\nand smiling pleasantly at Mary. \"I shall almost expect our host to be\r\nsarcastic.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sarcasm, Mr. Whitechoker,\" said the Idiot, unfolding his napkin, \"is\r\nall right in its place, but as I have grown older I haven't found that\r\nhaving given rein to it I was happier afterwards. Sometimes, no doubt,\r\nMrs. Pedagog has thought me rude--\"\r\n\r\n\"Never!\" said the ancient landlady.\r\n\r\n\"Well, there's something worse than having others think you rude,\" said\r\nthe Idiot. \"That's realizing yourself that you have been so, and I hope\r\nMrs. Pedagog will accept here and now an apology--a blanket\r\napology--which shall cover a multitude of past sins.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Idiot,\" said Mrs. Pedagog, \"do you know how I have always\r\nthought of you?\"\r\n\r\n\"As a son,\" said Mr. Pedagog. \"And I have felt towards you as a father.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder you didn't give me a thrashing once in a while, then,\" said\r\nthe Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"We have often wished to,\" observed Mr. Pedagog.\r\n\r\n\"John!\" cried Mrs. Pedagog.\r\n\r\n\"Well, _I_ have,\" said Mr. Pedagog. \"Mrs. Pedagog has all the amiable\r\nweakness of a woman towards her naughty boy. Spank him next time, not\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\nEverybody laughed, and the Idiot rose from his place and walked to Mrs.\r\nPedagog's side and kissed her.\r\n\r\n\"You're a nice old mommie,\" he said, \"and the naughty boy loves you.\r\nHe'll be hanged if he'll kiss his daddy, though!\" he added, with a\r\nglance at Mr. Pedagog.\r\n\r\n\"I will,\" said Mollie; and she did so.\r\n\r\nThe old Schoolmaster returned the little girl's salute with emphasis.\r\n\r\n\"Bless you, little one!\" he said, huskily. \"I love you even as I loved\r\nyour papa.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm a-goin' to kiss everybody,\" said Tommy; and he started in with Mary\r\nand put his little scheme through to the bitter end. \"What are we going\r\nto have for dessert?\" he added, complacently, as he resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\"Idiot,\" said Mr. Brief, when the third course had been served, \"what do\r\nyou mean by 'Last Call?'\"\r\n\r\n\"We are going to give up housekeeping,\" said the Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"No trouble, I hope,\" said Mr. Whitechoker.\r\n\r\n\"Lots!\" ejaculated the Idiot. \"But not very troublesome troubles. The\r\nfact is we intend to travel.\"\r\n\r\n\"To travel, eh?\" said the Genial Old Gentleman. \"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"Abroad,\" replied the Idiot. \"We have never been abroad, you know. I've\r\nbeen abroad, and Mrs. Idiot has been abroad, but _we_ have never been\r\nabroad. We are going together this time, and we are going to take the\r\nchildren, and for a year we propose to see Europe under the most\r\nfavorable conditions. I think that abroad will seem a little different\r\nif we go together.\"\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly,\" said Mr. Whitechoker. \"But London is a cold, godless\r\nplace.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is if you go alone,\" said the Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"And Paris is vile,\" suggested Mr. Brief.\r\n\r\n\"To the man who has only himself to think of,\" said the Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"And Italy is dirty,\" said the Bibliomaniac.\r\n\r\n\"There's water in Venice,\" observed the Idiot. \"Not very clean water, to\r\nbe sure, but wet enough to wash the edges of the sidewalks.\"\r\n\r\n\"And travel is uncomfortable,\" observed the Poet.\r\n\r\n\"Admitted,\" said the Idiot. \"Travel is about the hardest work and the\r\nworst-paid work I know of, but we cannot help ourselves. Now that we are\r\nrich we must accept the penalties imposed by modern society upon the\r\nwealthy. You never knew a rich man to lead a comfortable life, did you,\r\nMr. Pedagog?\"\r\n\r\n\"There are few of them who seem to know how,\" admitted the Schoolmaster.\r\n\"But--you do.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt,\" said the Idiot. \"But you see I do not wish to be\r\nostentatiously different from my kind, so having made a fortune I am\r\ngoing to live as people of fortune do and be as uncomfortable as I know\r\nhow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand about this fortune,\" said Mr. Brief. \"Have you run\r\nup against a rich uncle somewhere, or is this sudden wealth the result\r\nof your inventions, concerning which we have heard so much lately?\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither,\" replied the Idiot. \"The fact is, I made an investment some\r\nyears ago in a certain stock, for which I paid twenty-three. I sold it\r\nthree weeks ago for one hundred and sixty-three, clearing one hundred\r\nand forty dollars each on a thousand shares.\"\r\n\r\nThe Poet gasped.\r\n\r\n\"One hundred and forty thousand dollars profit!\" cried Mr. Whitechoker.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the Idiot, calmly, \"that's about the size of it. Terrible,\r\nisn't it? Here I was a happy man; content to stay at home and toil eight\r\nhours a day for a small stipend; living in tolerable comfort, and\r\nnothing to worry over. All of a sudden this thing happens, and like all\r\nother men of wealth I must become a wanderer. I shudder to think of what\r\nmight have happened if I'd made a million; I shouldn't have had a home\r\nat all then.\"\r\n\r\nThe guests looked at their host with amazement. To most of them he had\r\nreached the supreme moment of his idiocy.\r\n\r\n\"Ahem!\" said the Poet. \"I fail to see why.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look at the ways of the millionaire and you'll see,\" observed the\r\nIdiot, suavely. \"Given his million he gives up his house and builds\r\nhimself a small, first-class hotel in some big city, which for the\r\ngreater part of the year is occupied by servants. He next erects a\r\ncountry palace at Lenox or at Newport. This he calls a cottage, though\r\nit usually looks more like a public library or a hospital or a\r\nclub-house. Then he builds himself a camp, with stained-glass windows,\r\nin the Adirondacks, and has to float a small railroad in order to get\r\nhimself and his wife's trunks into camp. Shortly after these follows a\r\nbungalow modelled after a French chÃ¢teau, somewhere in the South, and\r\nthen a yacht warranted to cross the ocean in ten days, and to produce\r\nsea-sickness twelve hours sooner than the regular ocean-steamer, becomes\r\none of the necessities of life. Result, he never lives anywhere. To\r\noccupy all his residences, camps, and bungalows he has to keep eternally\r\non the move, and when he thinks he needs a trip to Europe he has his\r\nyacht got ready and sends it over, going himself on a fast steamer. He\r\nmeets his yacht at Southampton, and orders the captain to proceed\r\ndirectly to some Mediterranean port, going himself, meanwhile, to\r\nLondon. After a month of London he goes to Paris, and thence to the\r\nMediterranean port, where, after steaming aboard of the yacht for three\r\nor four days, he sends the boat back to New York and returns himself by\r\nthe regular liner. Oh, it's a terrible thing to be a millionaire and\r\nhave nowhere to lay one's head, with every poorer man envying you, many\r\nhating you, and hands raised against you everywhere.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, and the assembled company properly expressed their\r\nappreciation of the millionaire's hard lot by silence.\r\n\r\n\"The scheme has its advantages,\" observed Mrs. Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"Some,\" said the Idiot. \"But think, my dear, of the town house with\r\nthirty-nine servants; the Newport house with thirty-four; the camp with\r\nsixty, including gamekeepers and guides; the bungalow with thirty more,\r\nand the yacht with a captain, a crew, stewards, stewardesses, and a cook\r\nyou can't get away from without jumping overboard. Just think how that\r\nwould multiply your troubles. You would come to me from time to time and\r\nask me how I could expect you to discharge seven butlers and four cooks\r\nin one morning, and no doubt you'd request me sometimes to stop in at\r\nthe intelligence office on my way home and employ a dozen housemaids for\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you would have a manager for all this,\" suggested Mrs. Pedagog.\r\n\r\n\"That's the point,\" observed the Idiot. \"We'd have to have a manager,\r\nand for my part I shouldn't relish being managed. What chance would Mrs.\r\nIdiot have against a manager ahead of an army of servants of such\r\nmagnitude? We have more than we can keep in subjection as we stand now,\r\nwith this one small house. If it wasn't for Mary, who keeps an eye on\r\nthings, I don't know what we should do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I am glad you're rich, pa,\" said Tommy; \"you can increase my\r\nallowance.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I can have a pony,\" lisped Mollie.\r\n\r\n\"Alas! Poor children!\" cried the Idiot. \"That is the saddest part of\r\nwealth. Instead of bringing the little ones up ourselves, to be wholly\r\nfashionable it will be necessary to sublet the contract to a committee\r\nof tutors and governesses. The obligations of social life hereafter will\r\nrequire that we meet our children by appointment only, and that when\r\nthey dine they shall eat in solitary grandeur until they become so\r\npolished in manners that their parents may once more formally welcome\r\nthem at table. All the good old democratic ways of the domestic republic\r\nare now to be set aside. Tommy, instead of yelling for a buckwheat-cake\r\nat the top of his lungs, upon our return will request a butler in\r\nchoicest French to hand him a _pÃ¢tÃ© de foie gras_; and dear little\r\nMollie will have to give up attracting the waitress' attention by shying\r\nan olive-pit at her and imperiously summon her by means of an electric\r\nbuzzer set to buzzing with her toe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mercy! What a picture of woe!\" cried Mr. Pedagog.\r\n\r\n\"Not altogether true, is it?\" suggested the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever visited Newport?\" asked the Idiot.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the Doctor, \"never.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, don't,\" said the Idiot, \"unless you wish to look upon that\r\npicture--a picture of life whence childhood is abolished; where _blasÃ©_\r\nlittle swells take the place of lively small boys, and diminutive grand\r\nduchesses, clad in regal garb, have supplanted the little daughters who\r\nbring smiles and sunshine into the life of the common people. Ah, my\r\nfriends,\" the Idiot continued, with a shake of his head, \"there are sad\r\nsights to be seen in this world, but I know of none sadder than those\r\nrich little scions of the American aristocracy in whose veins the good\r\nred blood of a not very remote ancestry has turned blue through too much\r\nhigh living and too little real living.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think you'd take that hundred and forty thousand dollars and\r\nthrow it into the sea,\" said Mr. Brief.\r\n\r\n\"That would be wicked waste,\" observed the Idiot. \"I propose to use it\r\nto win back the good old home-life, and the best way to perpetuate that\r\nis to leave it for a time and travel. When you have travelled and seen\r\nhow uncomfortable others are, and discovered how uncomfortable you are\r\nwhile travelling, nothing can exceed the bliss of getting back to the\r\nfirst simple principles of the real home.\"\r\n\r\n\"As a sensible man, why don't you stay here, then?\" queried the Poet.\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" said the Idiot, \"if I stayed here with that hundred and forty\r\nthousand dollars on my mind I should nurse it, and in a short while I'd\r\nbecome a millionaire, and such a misfortune as that I shall never\r\ninvite. We shall go abroad and spend--\"\r\n\r\n\"Not all of it, I hope?\" said Mr. Whitechoker.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied the Idiot. \"But enough of it to mitigate the horrors of\r\nour condition while absent.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it was that Castle Idiot was closed, and that for a time at least\r\n\"The Idiot at Home\" became a thing of the past. Wherever he and his\r\nsmall family may be, may I not bespeak for him the kindly, even\r\naffectionate, esteem of those who have followed him with me through\r\nthese pages? He has his faults; they are many and manifest, for he has\r\nnever shown the slightest disposition to conceal them, but, as Mrs.\r\nPedagog remarked to me the other night, \"He has a large heart, and it is\r\nin the right place. If he only wouldn't talk so much!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy MARK TWAIN\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE MAN THAT CORRUPTED HADLEYBURG, AND OTHER STORIES AND ESSAYS.\r\nIllustrated by LUCIUS HITCHCOCK and Others.\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN CLAIMANT, AND OTHER STORIES AND SKETCHES.\r\n\r\nTHE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN.

In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenbergâ¢ and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundationâs EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your stateâs laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundationâs business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundationâs website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenbergâ¢ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenbergâ¢ electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenbergâ¢ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenbergâ¢ eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenbergâ¢ eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenbergâ¢,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks."
