It is more than a mile in\r\n         height. From its lofty “look-outs”\r\n         the beautiful bay of San Diego may\r\n         be descried, and also the distant\r\n         islands of Santa Catalina and San\r\n         Clemente. It abounds with gushing\r\n         springs, richly timbered table-lands,\r\n         deep, rocky canyons, and rugged peaks.\r\n         It is one of the favorite resorts of the\r\n         writer, who has spent many pleasant\r\n         hours in camp near the mysterious\r\n         hidden cabin above the “snow white\r\n         clouds,” in company with his friend,\r\n         the Rev. John L. Pitner, D. D., to\r\n         whom these lines are inscribed.\r\n\r\n                               D. W. E.\r\n\r\n         BIMINI SPRINGS\r\n         LOS ANGELES, CAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPALOMAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nA mile above the ocean’s level brim\r\nTow’rs Palomar, the monarch of the range.\r\nAlong its western base are frostless hills\r\nWith verdure crowned, and valleys green, where bloom\r\nAnd fruitage fill the air with sweet perfume.\r\nGreen pastures, rich with herbage and bright flowers,\r\nBedeck the eastern slopes which fall away\r\nA lone and weary desert land to meet;\r\nTo meet a lone and weary desert land--\r\nA rich and rocky land where mines of wealth\r\nHave slumbered long beneath its arid wastes.\r\nSo stands in majesty this mountain grand\r\nBetween the desert and the western sea.\r\nFrom ocean’s heaving breast, she upward sent\r\nA humid vapor, in the skies to meet\r\nAnd woo the softer breezes that ascend\r\nFrom off the heated earth at eventide.\r\nA gentle zephyr was at play among\r\nThe cacti beds and yuccas tall, that lift\r\nTheir spiny leaves and tufted fronds above\r\nThe burning sands; she softly breathed a sigh,\r\nAnd floating upward in the milky way\r\nShe met and wed the vapor from the sea;\r\nFor each had found a true affinity.\r\nThe moon withdrew and hid her face behind\r\nThe distant isles; and from the blushing east\r\nA ray of sunlight came and kissed the bride.\r\n\r\n    Together in the skies, these twain have wrought\r\nA mantle, soft as down, of spotless white;\r\nAnd often as the evening twilight falls,\r\nOr dewy morning sheds her purple tints,\r\nThey come and spread it over Palomar.\r\nThus runs the legend which has oft been told;\r\nAnd which the Indian maiden whispers low\r\nWhen snow white clouds hang over Palomar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HIDDEN CABIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The rugged sides of Palomar are deep\r\nWith canyons cleft, where raging floods have made\r\nTheir downward path and held their course unchained.\r\nBeyond the eagle’s nest and rocky crag,\r\nWhere giant arborvitaes throw their plumes\r\nAthwart the sky; and crystal waters cold\r\nAnd pure, come sparkling from a mountain spring;\r\nBy bending boughs and tangled vines shut out\r\nFrom view, the hidden cabin stood; and there\r\nToday it stands, and there has stood unkept,\r\nIn mystery wrapped, a hundred years or more\r\nSince its last tenant left it there alone.\r\nIt stands where it was builded long ago;\r\nYet not the same as in the days of old,\r\nFor long disuse and winters’ storms and rain\r\nHave left their mark; but still enough remains\r\nTo show that in the hands of him who built\r\nNo joiner’s tools were held; divested of\r\nAll metals with sharp edge save only axe\r\nAnd auger, which he plied with master hand\r\nTo hew the timbers smooth, and cut and fit\r\nThe doors and frames; and fitting, through these sent\r\nThe auger’s teeth to clear the way for pins\r\nOf wood with which he made all fast and strong.\r\n\r\n    A strange, pathetic story centers round\r\nThis lonely spot; the story of a true\r\nAnd faithful soul who counted life best spent\r\nBy those who strive to crucify the flesh,\r\nAnd emulate--as best poor mortal may--\r\nThe life of Him who lived and died for love;\r\nFor love of those who loved and hated Him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCEDRIC VAUGHN.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Classmates were Cedric Vaughn and Homer Lee.\r\nCedric from the southland came, and in his\r\nVeins there flowed--tho’ mixed with Anglo-Saxon--\r\nA trace of Montezuma blood, the same\r\nAs that of those who met with sharpened steel\r\nThe hosts of Cortez on the bloody plains\r\nOf Otumba. In the lightsome morning\r\nOf his happy youth, he saw that twain who\r\nGave him life and love, with all his kindred,\r\nBy savage hands _struck down_! struck down and flung\r\nAmid the blazing ruins of their home.\r\nWith superhuman strength he stood beside\r\nHis father ’till he fell; and then fought on\r\nLike wounded tiger, grimly courting death.\r\n\r\n    Filled with pagan superstition, that wild\r\nRobber chief--when he saw brave Cedric’s blade\r\nCleave skull and flesh, and break like slender reeds\r\nThe spears of those who came upon him three\r\nTo one--thought him protected by the gods\r\nAnd made immune to blows of mortal hands;\r\nStricken with fear lest in revengeful wrath\r\nThey turn on him, fell on his spear and died.\r\nThen the others fled and Cedric’s life was\r\nSpared. He, wand’ring aimless o’er the waste\r\nScarce knowing where his footsteps led, came where\r\nTerraced hills sloped to a narrow harbor.\r\nHe knew the place and knew his father had\r\nBeen well known there and much respected for\r\nFair dealing, when in trade he bought and sold;\r\nNot many days before, they together\r\nHad come down this dusty trail and returned\r\nWith family stores. Sadly he walked on, his\r\nPoor heart bleeding at remembrance of those\r\nHappy hours now gone, when suddenly he\r\nCame upon the spot where they had rested\r\nBy a spring and led their horses down;\r\nHere lay the branch his father’s hand had used\r\nTo urge the horses on; and half trodden\r\nIn the mold, and scattered round, the paper\r\nWhich he had seen his mother’s loving hands\r\nWrap ’round the food prepared by her for them.\r\nNow, for the first, he realized his loss.\r\n\r\n    Upon the cold, damp bosom of the earth\r\nHe laid his head and wept--alone! Beneath\r\nThe bending skies and sighing boughs; no loving\r\nHand upon his brow; no ear to hear the\r\nGroans that shook his iron frame; nor knew he\r\nHow near in that dark hour the heart of Him\r\nWho suffered in the garden all alone\r\nWas bending down to his. The soul may weep\r\nAnd still the flesh demand its own: Too proud\r\nTo eat the bread of charity, he sought\r\nAnd found employment in the mines. He worked\r\nWith heavy heart, crushed for a time by dark\r\nDespair; and giving way to hunger for\r\nRevenge, he well-nigh fell; but when at last\r\nA kindly light broke thro’ the gloom of his\r\nBlack night of grief, and he could say, “Thy will\r\nBe done”; in him awoke new life and hope\r\nAnd high resolve to make of his own life\r\nA memorial to them; and to strive\r\nTo reach the measure of their highest hope.\r\nTo this end he hoarded all his earnings,\r\nAnd with the salvage from the wreck of their\r\nEstate, went bravely forth, determined to\r\nFulfill their wish so oft expres’d that he\r\nMight go away to school--they named the school--\r\nThe greatest in the northland, whence they hoped\r\nTo see him come one day with cultured mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOMER LEE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Homer Lee was born and reared upon the\r\nSacred ground where beacon lights were kindl’d\r\nOn the hills, before the war that broke the\r\nChains of monarchy and set this nation\r\nFree. His father owned ships and lands and\r\nMerchandise; and the son--the eldest born--\r\nHad never known a wish ungratified.\r\nAlbeit, he was not puffed up, or vain,\r\nOr churlish by over-much indulgence,\r\nFor he was nurtured in the Quaker faith,\r\nAnd early taught to draw the line ’twixt\r\nRight and wrong; and measure men by what\r\nThey _are_ and not by what they _have or say_.\r\n    Unlike in all respects were Cedric Vaughn\r\nAnd Homer Lee, save in those noble traits\r\nOf character which make men strong and brave\r\nAnd true. Homer, lighter built and younger,\r\nBut noted for his prowess--when he met\r\nThe tall, dark, princely stranger from the south,\r\nAs by the power of some magnetic chain\r\nWas strangely drawn to him. Touched by the kind\r\nDemeanor of this fair-haired, happy youth,\r\nCedric’s heart went out to him. So, as the\r\nYears went by, between them grew a friendship\r\nStrong as that of Pythias and his friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDORA LEE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Homer’s sister, Dora Lee, rejoiced at\r\nTheir success, or wept when disappointment\r\nCrossed their path. Likewise, she shared in all their\r\nHappy leisure hours, when sailing on the\r\nBay, or riding horseback o’er the hills. And\r\nWhen their united strength their pennant saved,\r\nThe campus rang with shouts of victory\r\nAnd plaudits for the heroes of the day,\r\nShe wept for joy. Dora Lee loved Cedric,\r\nBut he knew it not nor dreamed that she whose\r\nFaithful heart could never love but one,\r\nHad consecrated that one love to him.\r\n\r\nTheir college days were drawing to a close;\r\nAnd nearer came the day when these two friends\r\nMust each go out to meet the sterner life--\r\nThe one to fill the place prepared for him;\r\nThe other, empty handed and alone.\r\nTheir intercourse--to each a priceless boon--\r\nHad ne’er been marred by shadow of distrust.\r\nA diamond careless thrown upon the sand,\r\nMay change the gentle current of a stream.\r\nAnd so it chanced the even current of\r\nTheir fellowship was broken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOLA VAIL.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    Lola Vail,--\r\nHer father, a rich planter, owned a vast\r\nEstate upon the banks of that great stream\r\nWhich gathers up the waters of the land\r\nAnd sweeps them onward to the gulf. Half way\r\nTo that strange southern land whence Cedric came\r\nWas Lola born--a schoolmate, friend and guest\r\nOf Dora Lee, and much like her; or as she\r\nWould appear with three more years of summers’\r\nSun to paint with ruddier glow the bloom of\r\nHealth upon her cheek, and tint with deeper\r\nGold her ample braids; in purity of\r\nThought and loyalty, they also were alike.\r\n\r\n    Lola’s mother died when she was young, and\r\nHer father, bringing home a Creole wife,\r\nUnwittingly neglected her; and thought\r\nHis duty done when he provided for\r\nThe child a nurse--an aged Octoroon--\r\nA pious soul, who gave to Lola all\r\nThe love she knew in her sweet childhood life;\r\nAnd filled the tender mind with holy thoughts\r\nAnd pure. And Lola daily gathered flowers\r\nAnd, weeping, laid them on her mother’s grave.\r\nWhen she was older grown, her father took\r\nHer to the north, she and her faithful nurse,\r\nTo bide until she grew to womanhood.\r\nHer education finished, her father\r\nCalled her home, but she begged to tarry, yet\r\nA few more days and visit with her friend.\r\n\r\n    Thus it chanced to come about that Cedric\r\nVaughn and Homer Lee met sweet Lola Vail\r\nAnd loved her, each in his own way--Cedric,\r\nWith all the fervor of his sincere soul--\r\nAnd Homer worship’d her, forgetting for\r\nThe time his own betrothed. Cedric told her\r\nAll, she sitting by his side in shady\r\nBower, upon a wooded isle, their boat drawn\r\nUp below upon the pebbly beach. He\r\nTold the story of his life, as one a\r\nPainful duty would perform. “She must know\r\nThe truth.” And keeping nothing back, he told\r\nHer of his birth and lineage--which was\r\nEqual to her own--his loss of home and\r\nWealth; his lofty aspirations; high hopes\r\nNow partly realized, though penniless;\r\nBut he was going back to that same land\r\nWhere he had delved; and there would he employ\r\nThe knowledge gained of placer, drift and ledge,\r\nAnd engineering, to locate and bring\r\nForth rich treasure from the earth, and in a\r\nFew short years would he return with wealth and\r\nBuild a costly home for her in some great\r\nCity,--she might name the place. “Could she love\r\nHim? Would she wait for him?” She answered not\r\nBy spoken word, but when she lifted her\r\nFond eyes to his, he read the sweet response.\r\n\r\n    By his strong arms encircled tenderly,\r\nHer head upon his breast, she wept for joy;\r\nAnd speaking through her tears: “Oh, leave me not,\r\nBut let me share your lot whate’er it be--\r\nA palace or a cot--I would leave all\r\nThe world, my Cedric, dear, and go with thee.”\r\nBut Cedric kindly told her of the place,\r\nIts roughness, the peons there; and frankly,\r\nBut perhaps unwise, he spoke of dangers\r\nFrom the wild bandits. It was no place for\r\nOne so sweet and gentle as his own dear\r\nLola; it were better she obey her\r\nFather’s call. That day, a week, the ship that\r\nHe expected her to take, would leave that\r\nPort. It would not be long; he would stop there\r\nOn his way and see her father, speak to\r\nHim, as man to man should speak, all fair and\r\nhonorable. The wisdom of his speech\r\nShe saw and cheerful yielded to his will.\r\nWith fervid kiss their pledges sealed, they sat\r\nIn sweet converse till lengthening shadows called;\r\nThen spread their sail and shoreward set the prow\r\nOf their light craft. With rosy finger tips\r\nShe swept the strings of her guitar and sang:\r\n\r\n“What fairy-like music steals over the sea,\r\nEntrancing the senses with calm melody?\r\n’Tis the voice of the mermaid as she floats o’er the main,\r\nAnd mingles her notes with the gondolier’s strain.”\r\n\r\n    Homer and his sister, waiting at the\r\nMooring, by their merry laughter and love\r\nGlances, half concealed, each read their secret;\r\nAnd reading, saw the fading shadows of\r\nTheir hope. Each concealed the pang; and laughing,\r\nTeased the truants for their tardiness. Then\r\nTimidly the lovers made confession.\r\n“And we will pray,” said Homer, “that to you\r\nBe given the fullness of all earthly\r\nJoy, and then the sweetest bliss of heaven.”\r\n\r\n    Lola left them; and the three in silence\r\nWatched her waving from the deck; and saw the\r\nGood ship fading in the offing vanish,\r\nWhere bending skies come down to meet the sea;\r\nThen sadly turned away--each heart, wounded\r\nBy a shaft from Cupid’s bow; arrows from\r\nHis quiver, unaimed, ofttimes fly amiss.\r\n\r\n    Too high born and proud were Dora Lee\r\nAnd Homer to harbor in their minds dark\r\nJealousies, or thoughts unkind; but Homer\r\nWas disconsolate; and Dora, cheering,\r\nSaid: “You surely will forget your grief; and\r\nGoing back to your first love will marry\r\nHer and love her evermore; for no true\r\nHeart can ever love but one.” So it was\r\nHer prophecy came true. Dora loved with\r\nWoman’s constancy; and womanlike found\r\nComfort in the secret hope (while wishing\r\nNaught but good for Lola Vail), the idle hope\r\nThat she one day would marry Cedric Vaughn.\r\n\r\n    If in the spirit world departed ones\r\nCan see with joy a loved one plodding on,\r\nAnd faithful to the end, achieve at last\r\nThe worthy object sought, then there was joy\r\nAbove when Cedric led the class and gained\r\nThe highest meed of praise for work well done.\r\n\r\n    Cedric saw, or tho’t he saw, a shorter\r\nWay to competence than any of the\r\nKindly offers of a place which, without\r\nHis asking, came to him; a great law firm\r\nWanted him; a professorship in that\r\nSame college he could have; in the counting\r\nHouse and busy marts of commerce there were\r\nMany op’nings for one as he so well\r\nEndowed and popular. He declined them\r\nAll; and yet so gracefully, with thanks, that\r\nThey were urged upon him all the more; but\r\nHe had fixed his mind on going back, see\r\nLola on his way, then hasten on to\r\nCarry out his plans; for each hour improved\r\nWould bring them nearer to their wedding day.\r\n\r\n    On the morn of his departure, a throng\r\nOf gay young friends came, bearing tokens of\r\nTheir friendship, souvenirs of college days,\r\nAnd bidding him God-speed upon his way.\r\nHe keenly felt the sting of parting with\r\nHis friends; but when he came to say good-bye\r\nTo Homer, that was hardest of it all.\r\nWhen Dora gave the parting hand, and in\r\nHer large blue eyes he saw the gathering\r\nTears, that tell-tale look of love she fain would\r\nHide; that yearning look of hopeless love\r\nLike arrow pierced his soul with deep regret,\r\nAnd haunted him thro’ all the coming years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VOYAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    With varying winds the good ship sailed thro’\r\nSummer sea. At times translucent clouds were\r\nFlung across its way like twilight mists, and\r\nThen anon the sun burst forth. With lowering\r\nWinds and listless sail they drifted dreamily\r\nBeneath the turquoise skies. When at night the\r\nMellow moonlight made its path across the\r\nWaves, Cedric paced the deck impatiently;\r\nAnd in his restless dreams he saw the face\r\nAnd form of Lola; felt her soft breath on\r\nHis cheek, her arms entwined about his neck\r\nIn heavenly bliss.\r\n\r\n                      At some port discharging\r\nFreightage, the ship would often linger for\r\nA day, and those on board would wander thro’\r\nThe town. Once they saw a vessel that plied\r\nBetween that southern coast and Africa\r\nUnload its cargo--human souls, who had\r\nBeen stolen from their home and brought to this\r\nFree country to be sold to servitude.\r\nThe buyers, richly dressed and bedecked with\r\nDiamonds, stood like drovers waiting at the\r\nCattle pens to buy. One gentleman with\r\nPistol at his belt, true type of southern\r\nCavalier, took a mother from her child;\r\nCedric pled with him to buy the baby\r\nToo. He was answered by an insult, and\r\nDerided for his pity for “the brat.”\r\nUnmindful of the insult to himself,\r\nHe persevered and gained consent to buy\r\nThe child and place it in its mother’s arms.\r\n\r\n    Off the south-most coast they saw the isle,\r\nThe magic isle of Bimini, where the\r\nIndian sages told De Leon he\r\nWould find the fountain of eternal youth.\r\nThence onward thro’ the gulf, and near that quaint\r\nOld Crescent City, he found his darling\r\nLola. Near the city in a lovely\r\nUrban villa on the rich plantation\r\nOf her father, where the oleanders\r\nBloom, and palmettos wave their fronded plumes,\r\nThey met once more. Her father, Colonel Vail,\r\nWas absent; would return in one week more.\r\nSix days, six blissful days, from early morn\r\nTill eve, the lovers wandered ’mid the scenes\r\nTo her, so rich in hallowed memories.\r\n\r\n    Sitting by her mother’s grave, she told him\r\nHow unlike the days of old she found her\r\nHome. Her father, with advancing age and\r\nGrowing wealth, had changed; become more like the\r\nOne who filled her mother’s place, purse-proud and\r\nHaughty. He had hinted at a union\r\nThat he desired for her, and she feared he\r\nWould not look with favor on her Cedric.\r\n\r\n    Like as the vine twines with the sturdy oak\r\nAnd clings the stronger when the north wind blows,\r\nSo she, as moved by some foreboding, clung\r\nTo him, and begged that she might go with him\r\nTo that far land; and coaxingly she said:\r\n“Who will spread the table for my Cedric?\r\nOr smooth his pillow? Or if mishap befall,\r\nNurse him back to health? If he goes alone,\r\nI ne’er shall look upon his face again.”\r\n\r\n    He kissed away her tears and playfully\r\nMade light of her misgiving; yet he was\r\nSorely tempted, and well-nigh gave way to\r\nHis desire; but that high sense of honor,\r\nAnd solicitude for her, gave him the\r\nMastery over self. And from that hour\r\nHe never knew a thought of selfishness.\r\nHe soothed her fears; and by words of wisdom,\r\n(As before) soon brought her judgment into\r\nSweet accord with his. But it was agreed\r\nThat if her father answered his request\r\nWith scorn, or treated him unkindly, there\r\nWould be no angry words. That he would go\r\nAnd never ask again. When he returned,\r\nWould take her as his rightful own; and then\r\nHe held her to his breast, and laid upon\r\nHer lips what they both well knew might be his\r\nFarewell kiss. For even then they saw her\r\nFather’s carriage coming up the drive. When\r\nThey met and she presented her betrothed,\r\nCedric recognized the man who bought the\r\nSlave and would have torn the infant from its\r\nMother’s breast. Yet, speaking calmly, told him\r\nWho he was, whence and why he came; told all\r\nManfully; and the Colonel heard him thro’.\r\n\r\n    Then, with derisive laugh, he taunted him\r\nFor his presumption: “A pauper, begging\r\nFor a queen! Nay, nay! The one who gains my\r\nDaughter’s hand must have a bank account or\r\nProperty in land or slaves.” The hot blood\r\nRushing to his brow, he boldly answered:\r\n“I go, accepting these conditions, but\r\nSurely will return.” Then, taking Lola’s\r\nHand, said cheerfully: “’Till then, good-bye.” With\r\nTearless eyes she proudly looked upon her\r\nCedric, and stood as strong and brave as he.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MINES.\r\n\r\n\r\n    When Cedric reached that country where precious\r\nMetals and bright gems, by nature’s cunning\r\nHand are tucked away and hidden in the\r\nRocks or scattered in the sands, he found a\r\nDusky peon--Jose Morales--whom he\r\nHad known and trusted, and took him with his\r\nTrain of donkeys packed with stores; with miner’s\r\nPick and spade and crucible, he bravely\r\nPlunged into the wilderness. For many\r\nLong and weary days he sought among the\r\n_Dry Lomitas_, sought in vain beneath a\r\nTropic sun, lured on by prospects that proved\r\nValueless. And when at last he found a\r\nVein of quartz that sparkled with the golden\r\nGrains, he was compelled to leave it there, to\r\nWait thro’ long decades for other hands to\r\nCome with stamp and chemicals to crush the\r\nRock and bear away the millions he had\r\nFound. He working, saw the months pass by, but\r\nLabored on with Lola ever in his\r\nMind. Anon there crept before his sight\r\nA vision of that peaceful shore where first\r\nThey met,--a cottage home--his Lola with\r\nA blue-eyed baby kneeling by her side,\r\nWhite robed, with golden curls, in attitude\r\nOf prayer--that evening prayer by mother taught;\r\nThen he saw the blessings of the simpler,\r\nHoly life; saw that wealth is least of all.\r\n\r\n    One day Morales in quest of water\r\nSent, returned in great excitement, crying\r\n“Oro grande, señor! Oro grande!”\r\nIn a deep arroyo in the sands for\r\nAges washed by floods from mountain storm,\r\nJose had discovered as he said, “much\r\nGold.” In cup-like hollows of the rocks by\r\nFalling waters worn away--in yellow\r\nNuggets buried in the sand--he found the\r\nGlittering fortune they so long had sought.\r\nThis he changed for currency of lighter\r\nWeight and coin, in that old city where his\r\nForbears died; then to the seaport sped, there\r\nImpatient waited for the ship to come\r\nAnd carry him in triumph to his bride.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEN RUBIDEAUX.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The consul, seeking Cedric, told him he\r\nHad sent a messenger in search of him\r\nWith letters, and gave him one from Lola,\r\nRequesting that the messenger be sent.\r\nCedric sent Morales to intercept\r\nThe messenger and bring the letters back.\r\nThis the faithful fellow did, and Cedric\r\nRead them with dismay. Morales saw the\r\nTroubled look on Cedric’s face and begged to\r\nGo with him. With his tamales, and his\r\nMascal, and being Cedric’s servant, he\r\nWas satisfied. He cared not for his share;\r\nWould leave it all with him. Cedric, with real\r\nAffection, grateful for his faithfulness,\r\nTold him he might go and evermore abide\r\nWith him.\r\n\r\n            He read the letters o’er and\r\nO’er with sinking heart, read Lola’s letters.\r\nBeginning at the first, he read how proud\r\nOf him she was when he “so grandly stood\r\nBefore her father, with the bearing of\r\nA king, and faced him in his wrath;” then of\r\nHer sad and lonely days when he was gone;\r\nHow her father sought by gentleness to\r\nMould her to his will and bring her to forget\r\nThe one she loved. Of the attention paid\r\nBy Simon Blake, her father’s friend and boon\r\nCompanion, the man he wanted her to\r\nWed,--a vile, besotted wretch who knew no\r\nGod but gold; she hated gold and wished that\r\nHe might come back poor in all but love and\r\nPurity of soul, with which no other\r\nRiches can compare.\r\n\r\n                  This man had urged his\r\nSuit until she had exhausted all the\r\nHarmless arts of womanhood to evade\r\nHis coarse advances, praying daily that\r\nHer Cedric would return; when he boldly\r\nClaimed her hand, she told him, “No;” he bro’t her\r\nFather who commanded that she wed him;\r\nShe, helpless in their hands, had pled for time--\r\nOne more year; then, if Cedric had not come,\r\nHer answer they should have. One day she, in\r\nAn arbor half hidden in the trellis,\r\nHad heard her father’s overseer, Ben\r\nRubideaux, and Simon Blake make bargain\r\nThat for a sum the overseer would watch\r\nFor Cedric and murder him if he should\r\nCome. She knew he did not fear them all, but\r\nFor her sake, she begged him not to venture\r\nThere. She gave a number in the city\r\nWhere he would find a friend, a lady friend,\r\nOf hers. It was arranged that she should come\r\nFor her. Then, as his lawful wife, he could\r\nDefend her and himself, if needs must be.\r\n’Twere best that he should come with pistols, armed;\r\nBen Rubideaux and Blake were desperate\r\nAnd wicked men. She wrote, fearing lest her\r\nLetters would not be received; since he left,\r\nShe had received no word from him; she knew\r\nThat he would write, but they had come between.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WEDDING.\r\n\r\n\r\n    This plan was not to Cedric’s liking for\r\nHe would fain have gone openly and claimed\r\nHis bride, but for her sake he acquiesced,\r\nAnd in his servant’s name he took a house,\r\nA lovely house, in quiet place apart.\r\nThere Lola came, and as the light of slow\r\nDescending sun proclaimed the dying day,\r\nAnd zephyrs laden with the breath of bloom\r\nAnd tuneful with the song of mocking bird,\r\nWere wafted from the sea, then from the mission\r\nCame the parish priest, and in soft accents\r\nOf the Spanish tongue, pronounced the holy\r\nWords that made them one. No other witness\r\nThan his servant and her friend. And there thro’\r\nLong and dreamy, blissful days, they passed their\r\nHoneymoon.\r\n\r\n                    Morales, with his native\r\nInstinct, saw that danger hovered over\r\nCedric; and, unknown to him, he shadowed\r\nAll his steps. One night a messenger in\r\nHaste came to the door, told Cedric that his\r\nServant was in trouble, needed him; he\r\nWent, not knowing that his faithful Jose\r\nShadowed them. When near the water front the\r\nStranger fled; and from the cotton bales and\r\nFreightage piled upon the dock, two ruffians\r\nSprang on Cedric. When the light of morning\r\nDawned, the lifeless forms of Simon Blake, Ben\r\nRubideaux and poor Morales were found\r\nLying on the bloody dock.\r\n\r\n                                All night Lola\r\nPaced the floor in anguish, list’ning for the\r\nFootsteps that came not. Nor knew she of the\r\nTragedy until she read: “Murdered! In the\r\nNight! Two citizens of high repute shot down!\r\nBut not until one of the murderers\r\n(A bearded foreigner) was killed by them.\r\nThe other has escaped, but the mob is\r\nOn his track and he will soon be taken.”\r\nThe paper gave a good description of\r\nHer husband, which she doubted not, was given\r\nBy the man who called for him. If she should\r\nSpeak, it would bring harm to Cedric; he might\r\nEscape and come to her; so, taking hope,\r\nWith one trusty servant she in hiding\r\nWaited there. Her friend had gone and no one\r\nKnew of her abiding place.\r\n\r\n                            The weary\r\nWeeks and months rolled by; she pined, and passing\r\nNear the gates of death, awoke to find a\r\nBlue-eyed baby by her side--the child of\r\nCedric’s dreams. The months passed by and still\r\nNo word from Cedric came. She, yielding to\r\nHer grief and drooping, faded as a flower\r\nThat withering in decadence fades away.\r\nThe rosy seraph sent--so kindly sent--\r\nFrom heaven to be the precious idol of\r\nHer solitude, and his, grew strong and more\r\nAngelic as the passing days went by.\r\n\r\n    When the ruffians from the darkness sprang on\r\nCedric, with ready shot, the foremost fell;\r\nBut the bludgeon of the other laid him\r\nLow; then, as the fatal blow was falling,\r\nMorales coming, threw himself between;\r\nAnd in deadly combat grappled with Ben\r\nRubideaux. With bowie knives they struggled,\r\nEach receiving fatal thrusts, nor yielded\r\nUntil weak from loss of blood, they parting\r\nFell; Morales’ bowie buried in the\r\nHeart of Rubideaux. Cedric lay for hours,\r\nUnconscious; then, his strength returning, he\r\nRose, and dazed, bewildered, groped along the\r\nFrontage, stag’ring like a drunken man; the\r\nStevedores thought him one returning from a\r\nNight’s debauch. He in the early morning,\r\nCame where a boat was loosening its cables\r\nFrom the wharf; and unnoticed, stumbled on\r\nAnd fell among the luggage in a swoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MYSTIC TOKEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The boat--bound for the Indies--was well out\r\nOn the gulf before they found and lifted\r\nHim; nor knew they of the tragedy upon\r\nThe dock, or that he was hunted as a\r\nMurderer. They finding on his person\r\nThe token of a craft which they reveréd,\r\nThey cared for him and left him safely in\r\nAn island city of the Southern Sea.\r\nThere his brother craftsmen gathering round him,\r\nNursing--raised him--raised him as one from the\r\nDead. From the “Valley of the Shadows” brought\r\nHim forth to perfect health and vigor; but\r\nAlas! the silken cord that erstwhile bound\r\nHim to the past, was broken! _Memory\r\nWas gone!_ Nor, with active mind and clear, could\r\nHe recall the past, tell his name or whence\r\nHe came. He strove to lift the veil and look\r\nBeyond the wall of night that intervened.\r\nThat cruel blow had caused a lesion of\r\nThe brain--a lapse of memory complete.\r\nAs the wire that bears the hidden current\r\nBroken, swaying in the breeze, connecting\r\nSends a gleam across the night, so at times\r\nBright gleams of memory, almost taking\r\nShape, would light his way; then leaving him in\r\nGreater darkness, would as quickly fly away.\r\n\r\n    Gradually came before his sight, as\r\nDimly seen thro’ nebulae, the outlines\r\nOf a form and face came from the misty\r\nMoonlight of the past. At last, came back to\r\nHim, that picture which had made the deepest\r\nImprint on his mind--his Lola, as he\r\nSaw her standing by her father’s side. But\r\nWhen was this? And where? And who was she?\r\nBy exercise of all the strength of his\r\nGreat will, her name once more came back to him,\r\nAnd then her father’s; then the city where\r\nThey lived; and then it was borne in on him\r\nThat she was his betrothed; that he had gone\r\nTo that fair isle to make a home for her.\r\nNow, having gained the wherewithal, he could\r\nGo and bring her. With this thought, the flame of\r\nLove rekindled blazed anew, as clearly\r\nHe remembered those six happy days of\r\nLove with her--what she said, his promises;\r\nAnd now--his hot blood leaping to the call,\r\nHe hastened on his way. Arriving there,\r\nHe straightway went to find her father’s\r\nHome and claim her as he swore to do the\r\nDay he left her there. The Colonel met him\r\nWith a scornful smile and said: “So you have\r\nCome? You may have her, if you wish for such\r\nAs she.” Breaking forth in rage, he cried--with\r\nOaths--“Go! Find her at the hospital”--he\r\nTold the driver where--“Go! Find her with her\r\nChild of shame; they are good enough for you!\r\nI care not if she fills a harlot’s grave.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STOLEN CHILD.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Cedric, smitten almost to the death, bade\r\nThe driver go with haste. He found her and\r\nShe, smiling, whispered low: “My Cedric, you\r\nHave come to meet me. Is this heaven?” then placed\r\nThe baby hand in his and falling back,\r\nShe was _indeed in heaven_. Cedric, tearless,\r\nFor a moment stood as one struck dumb; then\r\nTook the baby in his arms. She too young\r\nTo understand, or lisp her mother’s name\r\nOr his, as though instinctively, she threw\r\nHer rosy arms about his neck and kissed\r\nHim. Then confiding, laid her golden curls\r\nUpon his breast. The nurses, thinking him\r\nA base deserter, hoping he at least\r\nWould own the child, and seeing him caress\r\nIt--placed tenderly its costly wrappings\r\n’Round, and quickly packed its ample clothing,\r\nGave it him. He kissed the marble brow and\r\nTurning to the one who had the right to\r\nSpeak for all, he inquired about the rites\r\nAnd ceremonies of her faith, “Were they\r\nPerformed?” “Yes,” the matron said, “the good priest\r\nHas been often by her side, left her just\r\nBefore you came; the one who married her.”\r\n\r\n    He paced the hall and pondered, mystified.\r\nWhat he had heard and seen had set his brain\r\nAwhirl. So she was married! Then to whom?\r\nHer husband might at any moment come\r\nAnd claim his child--claim Lola’s child--he quick\r\nResolved to take the babe and give his life\r\nTo her--to care for her, for Lola’s sake;\r\nFor she was Lola’s child, if not his own.\r\nThey must not know that he was not the one\r\nWho married her. He must not see the priest.\r\nHe, in his frenzy, cast aside all thought\r\nOf right or wrong--decided he would\r\nSteal--yea, lie or even die before that\r\nOne who had deserted her should have her\r\nChild. He gave them gold, and speaking calmly,\r\n(Falsely, too, as he supposed) said: “Tell them\r\nHer husband ordered that her last resting\r\nPlace shall be a mausoleum grand, and\r\nTo him you gave the child--the one to whom\r\nIt rightfully belongs; say that he loved\r\nHer to the last, and would that he had died;\r\nThat she had mourned for him--not he for her.”\r\nThen, with a farewell kiss, he took the child,\r\nBelieving he was stealing it away.\r\nThe baby clung to him and was content.\r\n\r\n    But for the child his life had ended there;\r\nThen there had been no tie to bind, no one\r\nTo love. The past almost a blank, and in\r\nThe future no alluring hope, he fain\r\nHad snap’d the slender thread of life, to be\r\nWith Lola evermore. Or, had he been\r\nOne of the weaker kind, complaining at\r\nHis fate, he had perchance by slower\r\nProcess, ended all in low debauchery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WANDERERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n    But those confiding arms, that baby kiss\r\nUpon his cheek, sent thro’ the aisles of his\r\nGreat, generous heart, a flood of newborn\r\nLove. To part with her would be indeed to\r\nPart with life itself. He, thinking quickly\r\nAnd as quickly acting, fled--took the first\r\nShip that sailed, nor asking whither it was\r\nBound; rejoicing when it cleared the dock and\r\nSeaward turned its prow. When learning that its\r\nCourse lay to the north, he changed to one bound\r\nFor the South Sea Isles.\r\n\r\n                        Sailing to and fro,\r\nThe changing seasons passed while they upon\r\nThe ocean cruised like wanderers without\r\nA guide; he thinking only of his charge,\r\nAnd where he, in her tender years, the\r\nBest could care for her. Willing hands he found--\r\nMothers’ hands outstretched to take the cherub\r\nFrom his arms. She, growing, Cedric saw in\r\nHer the image of her mother--the same\r\nBlue eyes and wavy hair which fell about\r\nHer shoulders; high arching brows and lashes\r\nLong but darker shaded, like his own. He\r\nHad thought to call her Lola; but when the\r\nStranger asked her name, she lisping answered,\r\n“Zola,” he left it so.\r\n\r\n                          Tho’ long before\r\nThe day when ox-carts plowed their dusty way\r\nAcross the plains to reach the sun land slopes,\r\nThe Eldorado of the west, he knew\r\nOf that fair land beside the sunset sea--\r\nThat sunny, southern California.\r\nThere they would go, where none would ever hear\r\nThe story of the stolen, nameless child;\r\nAnd where the recreant father ne’er would\r\nCome. There would he seek and find in sylvan\r\nQuietude, the sweetest spot where Mother\r\nNature reigns and in her lap, among the\r\nBirds and flowers, would she be reared in spotless\r\nPurity--educated--taught by him--\r\nAs wise men of the olden times received\r\nTheir learning from the doctors of the law.\r\n\r\n    Thitherward they sailed; and thro’ the rocky\r\nGateways of the cape--tho’ roughly shaken--\r\nSafely passed; then to the north thro’ calmer\r\nWaters, borne by Etesian winds, oft-times\r\nDelayed by traffic at the ports, or on\r\nA glassy sea becalmed. And once their ship\r\nWas overtaken by an ugly craft\r\nThat bore the pirates’ flag; and every man\r\nOn board was called to arms; then they were\r\nWell nigh overwhelmed and taken. Cedric,\r\nJoining with the crew, fought valiantly. Thro’\r\nThe thickest of the battle, Zola clung\r\nTo him. When they would have taken her below,\r\nShe cried, “Let me stay wiz papa; if he\r\nGo, zen me go too.” Cedric answered, “Be\r\nIt so; we live or die together.” But\r\nTheir fears were turned to great rejoicing when\r\nA shot crashed thro’ the pirate craft. They sailed\r\nAway and left it sinking in the deep.\r\n\r\n    Cedric, by his bravery and coolness\r\nIn the time of danger, won respect and\r\nFriendship of officers and crew. When they\r\nLeft him at the mission of the holy\r\nPadres, on the bay of San Diego,\r\nLoaded him with costly presents, forced them\r\nOn him, presents for himself and Zola.\r\nThe angelic child had won the hearts of all.\r\n\r\n    Cedric told the good Franciscan fathers\r\nHe was going northward overland, and\r\nJoyously he set about preparing\r\nFor the journey, she ever at his side,\r\nWith childish prattle, asking, “What is zis?”\r\n“What is zat?” and “What for?” He answering\r\nCheerfully and evermore explaining--\r\nTeaching her.\r\n\r\n              In her sweet companionship\r\nAnd the certainty of keeping her, he\r\nLaid aside his sadness and became as\r\nLight of heart and happy as herself. At\r\nLast they were all ready to begin their\r\nWild and free nomadic life--a dozen\r\nGentle burros, packed with all that they might\r\nNeed for months to come; a tent with costly\r\nFurs and rugs, and blankets of bright colors\r\nBo’t from the Indians, with toys and gaudy\r\nTrinkets; a snow-white pony, showily\r\nEquip’d with Spanish bit and bridle,\r\nUpon its back a basket, sedan-like,\r\nWith crimson canopy, lined with softest\r\nSilken draperies, for his “Gypsy queen.”\r\nA princess of the Romany was ne’er\r\nProvided with such luxuries as she.\r\n\r\n    In the early morning, long before the\r\nRinging of the mission bells, Zola and\r\nHer strange retinue set forth; the pony,\r\nWith its precious burden, led by Cedric’s\r\nHand; then came the white milk goats with tinkling\r\nBells; to the sound, the meek-faced burros, trained\r\nTo follow, trailed patiently behind; and\r\nThen a faithful shepherd dog to keep them\r\nAll in line. They moved by easy stages,\r\nStopping often in some shady dell to\r\nRest and let their burros feed upon the\r\nGrassy slopes. Then would Zola gather flowers,\r\nOr chase the yellow butterflies, with shouts\r\nOf childish glee that echoed thro’ the glen;\r\nTo him a sweeter music than the chime\r\nOf great cathedral bells or orchestra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE MOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\n\r\n    They exploring, crossed the great Cuyamaca\r\nRange, traversed its broad plateaus, and thro’ the\r\nSilence of its lofty domes and canyons;\r\nThen beyond, where boiling waters gurgling\r\nFlowed thro’ Indian villages. They saw\r\nThe waving pines upon the lofty crest\r\nOf Palomar; and wandering, vainly sought\r\nAlong its base for passage leading to\r\nIts heights. They often reached an eminence,\r\nAnd thought they neared the goal, when overhanging\r\nWalls of granite turned them back. At last, by\r\nPersevering, came upon its table-\r\nLands; and pressing forward found the place he\r\nLong had pictured in his mind--the sheltering\r\nBoughs of giant trees, the gushing fountain,\r\nLevel plot of fertile land below, well\r\nWatered by the rivulets that trickled\r\nFrom the springs. Here he sowed the garden seeds\r\nAnd grain; and from the chaparral he bro’t\r\nThe antlered buck and lesser game. The sweets\r\nThe toiling honey bee had stored away,\r\nDrip’d from the boles of sycamore and oak.\r\nThey happy lived in Nature’s luxury.\r\n\r\n    Lest in their quietude he might become\r\nIndifferent or wasteful of the time,\r\nHe took up an ancient system which they\r\nFaithfully observed thro’ all their years of\r\nHermitage--eight hours for labor, eight for\r\nRest, and eight for study and improvement\r\nOf his mind, and teaching Zola.\r\n\r\n                                  He was\r\nThe builder of the hidden cabin; for\r\nZola it was builded, for her boudoir.\r\nWith loving hands, he axe and auger plied,\r\nWithout compass, square or trestle board,\r\nBut with all the tenderness that ever\r\nMother bird provided for her nestling.\r\nHe building, furnished it with draperies--\r\nBright Indian blankets, rugs and robes of\r\nFur, arranging all as beautiful as\r\nTho’ her mother’s spirit hands had guided\r\nHis. Perchance they did. If love be spirit,\r\nAnd spirit love--or soul--then such as hers\r\nMight overleap the balustrades of\r\nHeaven and find its own; or such unselfish\r\nSoul as his might rise and view the palace\r\nOf the skies. He teaching, opened first the\r\nBook of Nature, and strolled with her among\r\nThe flowers and botanized. Then to the rocks;\r\nHe told her of the slow formations of\r\nThe ages. From the books selected in\r\nThe days when she was cradled on the sea,\r\nHe, in learning, carried her beyond her\r\nYears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“PEG LEG, THE MINER.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    They marked the changing moons until a\r\nScore had glided by and yet had seen no\r\nOther human face save one--and he, an\r\nHonest miner whom they found in sorry\r\nPlight, with broken limb, where he had fallen\r\nFrom an overhanging ledge. They succored\r\nHim until, returned to strength, he rose with\r\nOne limb twisted hopelessly. They made--as\r\nBest they could--a wooden substitute, and\r\nStrap’d with buckskin bandage, he soon learned to\r\nUse it cleverly. Jokingly, he called\r\nHimself “Peg-leg, the miner.” He told them\r\nOf a mine that out upon the desert\r\nHe had found, where three large buttes stood side by\r\nSide. Cedric gave him burros from his herd,\r\nAnd packs, and sent him on his way. He came\r\nAgain with well-filled sacks of pellets round\r\nAs shot and black as ebony, which proved\r\nTo be pure gold. He left it there, and leaving,\r\nNevermore returned. Miners to this day\r\nIn vain have sought that “Peg-leg Mine,” and those\r\nThree buttes; and some have left their bones to bleach\r\nUpon the desert sand. The miner told\r\nThem of a nearer passage, a hidden\r\nTrail, that led downward to the valley. They\r\nGoing, tarried there and Cedric sent the\r\nIndians to the mission for supplies.\r\n\r\n    Once a cougar sprang across their path with\r\nBlazing eyes and crouching for a spring; when\r\nCedric sent a bullet thro’ its brain; and\r\nFrom its den he took a pair of baby\r\nMountain lions, made orphans by the shot.\r\nZola, pitying, took them home and one,\r\nSurviving, grew to monstrous size, became\r\nObedient to her command, and like\r\nA faithful watch dog, followed her. She\r\nCalled him Zimbo. Other pets she had--white\r\nKids of silken fleece, birds and animals,\r\nBut Zimbo was the monarch of them all.\r\n\r\n    As the circling years went ’round and she could\r\nSee beyond the golden morning of her\r\nSunny life the ripening noonday coming\r\nOn, she longed to see the world beyond her\r\nMountain home; but named it not to Cedric.\r\nWith her years she grew more fearless, wild and\r\nVenturesome. With Zimbo and her rifle,\r\nShe scaled the dizzy heights of rock and crag\r\nWhere condors built their nests, and knew the\r\nDevious windings of the wild doe’s trail,\r\nThro’ manzanita groves and chaparral.\r\nIn a seat of granite, nature fashioned,\r\nLike a throne, shaded by a giant oak\r\nUpon a summit looking oceanward,\r\nShe would sit in dreamy mood and watch the\r\nSilvery line of surf that fringed the far-off\r\nFading stretch of blue. Once she saw a sail\r\nAppear, then slowly vanish in the offing;\r\nAnd in the quiet of an early morn,\r\nShe heard the low sweet chime of mission bells.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGILBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\n    To that same port where Cedric landed with\r\nHis Zola, others came from distant parts.\r\nSome came to seek their fortunes, others came\r\nTo buy and till the soil, some to obey\r\nThe inborn instinct of the pioneer.\r\nOne family, leaving all behind, had bro’t\r\nA sickly child. Rich and prosperous they\r\nHad been, and with children blessed; but a dread\r\nContagion had swept them all away save\r\nOne; and he, left delicate and frail, the\r\nIdol of their hopes--no other left to\r\nKeep the family name. From those who best could\r\nSpeak, they learned there was no hope unless it be\r\nIn taking him to that fair, sunny clime.\r\nThey hastened there and gave him for his home\r\nA quaint old hacienda of the Dons;\r\nWith many leagues of land that lay between\r\nThe mountains and the sea. There amid the\r\nOrange groves and vineyards, in the freedom\r\nOf the range where roamed his father’s flocks and\r\nHerds, young Gilbert soon became a gay young\r\nCaballero--grew as strong and fearless\r\nAs vaqueros of the range--could twirl the\r\nLariat or aim the rifle true as they.\r\n\r\n    Sunburned, strong and handsome was Gilbert, in\r\nShowy costume of the Dons, with clanking\r\nSpurs, gold-mounted trappings on his coal-black\r\nLeo, ambling thro’ the massive arches\r\nOf the mission. Señoritas smiled on\r\nHim; he returned their loving glances. This\r\nHis parents seeing, feared their Angelo\r\nBlood be mixed with that of darker hue, besought\r\nHim to return to their old home and there\r\nTo find a bride of his own faith and kind.\r\nHe quieted their fears and said that he\r\nWas wedded to the mesa and the hills.\r\nHe loved the mountains more than ever\r\nBridegroom loved his bride, his heart was free;\r\nBut kind and true and dutiful to them,\r\nHe promised solemnly that he would do\r\nAs they desired before he took a wife;\r\nFor ne’er could he repay the love and care\r\nBy them bestowed on him, their sacrifice.\r\n\r\n    Foremost in all manly sports, he reckless\r\nRode along the beach where foaming breakers\r\nLashed the cliffs, fleet-footed Leo dashed between.\r\nHis black horse was known on El Camino\r\nReal--far beyond the shady groves of\r\nMonte Vista. He loved the mountains\r\nAnd on their bosom laid his head beneath\r\nThe starlit skies, companion of their silence,\r\nPartaker of their rest. In midnight darkness\r\nCould he thread the winding Indian trail\r\nAcross the high Cuyamacas, and often\r\nHad he reached the base of Palomar, and\r\nLonged to see beyond its frowning granite\r\nWalls. At last, undaunted, came nearly to\r\nThe summit--came where a deep-walled canyon held\r\nHim back, there rested. The autumn sun was\r\nSlowly sinking to the sea and bathed the\r\nMountain side in flood of rosy-tinted\r\nBrilliancy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZOLA AND ZIMBO.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Upon a shelving rock near\r\nBy, a being of angelic beauty\r\nStood; posed statue-like, her eyes fix’t on the\r\nDistant sea; one hand spread gracefully\r\nAcross her brow, the other holding back\r\nA monster mountain lion that crouching\r\nAt her feet, lay watching him; a robe of\r\nSoftest fabric, yielding to the breeze, revealed\r\nThe ample fulness of her shapely form;\r\nCaught back by strand of sparkling gems, a mass\r\nOf golden hair fell nearly to her feet.\r\nShe unconscious of his presence, Gilbert\r\nStood in speechless adoration, as one\r\nEntranced,--lost in wonderment. Who was this\r\nPersonage divine? This apparition\r\nCome to him on that lone mountain side? Was\r\nShe some fairy elf come to bewitch him?\r\nSome mountain sprite? Or angel from the throne?\r\nWith throbbing temples, arms outstretched, as tho’\r\nHe fain would leap the chasm that lay between,\r\nPressed slowly to its edge. The lion rising\r\nAngrily to spring, she saw him standing\r\nThere and vanished from his sight. Then from the\r\nRocks, he heard her voice call softly, sternly:\r\n“Come, Zimbo, come! _Come here!_” The spell was\r\nBroken; by those words in his own tongue\r\nHe knew that she was of the earth--one like\r\nHimself--and not a native of that land.\r\n\r\n    Day after day did he return to that\r\nSame spot and, waiting patient, watch for her;\r\nOnce for a moment saw her on the heights,\r\nAnd again, he saw the eyes of that great\r\nLion fixed on him and knew that she was\r\nNear. Like knight of old he scaled the highest\r\nPeaks and stood upon the spot her feet had\r\nPressed. With throbbing pulse and palpitating\r\nHeart he followed in pursuit. The kindly\r\nRocks revealed no tell-tale foot prints where her\r\nFeet had touched them in her flight. The summer\r\nWore away and autumn came again; yet\r\nShe cunningly evaded him. Growing\r\nDesperate, he traversed all the length and\r\nBreadth of Palomar; at times he heard her\r\nVoice in song, heard her speak to Zimbo, she\r\nNear him; for a precious moment saw her,\r\nBut in finesse she more than equalled him.\r\n\r\n    Gilbert’s parents missed his merry laugh and\r\nJest; marvelled at his absence; feared that\r\nHe was ill and questioned him. He told them\r\nHe was hunting in the mountains, but he\r\nMentioned not the object of his quest; misled\r\nThem by tales of condor’s nest and mountain\r\nLion he had seen.\r\n\r\n                        Likewise was Cedric\r\nTroubled by the change he saw in Zola.\r\nShe loved Gilbert--loved him wildly, madly.\r\nShe had watched him when he knew it not, and\r\nKnew that he loved her; but frightened at the\r\nThought, was minded to keep the secret\r\nLocked in her own breast and fly from him; so\r\nTimidly she asked if some day they might\r\nGo away, and sailing o’er the ocean\r\nFind another home. Cedric answered, “Yes,\r\nSome day.” He had long expected this and\r\nUnknown to her, had in a way, prepared\r\nHer for the change. From that lone mountain top\r\nLetters had been sent to shops and houses\r\nOf the east, and yearly in return had\r\nCome by Indian carriers from the port\r\nClothing for himself and Zola, made to\r\nMeasure sent, and always in their study\r\nHours they dressed resplendently, that she might\r\nGrace a drawing-room and feel at ease--not\r\nShow that she in wilderness was reared.\r\nShe had mastered music and languages\r\nIn travel needed most, and was withal\r\nA finished scholar. Not for himself but\r\nHer, he feared to take her hence--knew full well\r\nThat one so beautiful would soon be wooed,\r\nAnd he had never told her of the cloud\r\nThat hung around her birth--the cloud of\r\nMystery. As for himself, he loved her\r\nAll the better for it--she blameless--he\r\nIn tenderness postponed the hour; but the\r\nLonger left undone, he dreading knew that\r\nOne day it must come; in honor must he\r\nSpeak--must tell her, though it break her heart, to\r\nKnow that he was not her father. Often\r\nDid he wish that in her childhood had he\r\nTold her all. Yet, in his weakness, promised\r\nHer that some day they would go: “Yes; some day.”\r\n\r\n    Gilbert, growing wise in woodcraft and in\r\nThe art of making love, on the farther\r\nSide went up the mountain, rode Leo up\r\nThe winding trail; Zola watching, waited\r\nDisappointed while he--galloping o’er the\r\nTable-land--came on Cedric busy in\r\nHis garden. They with kindly greeting met,\r\nConversing, found each the other to his\r\nLiking. He too manly to dissemble,\r\nGilbert came out openly: The one so\r\nCoy and beautiful, was she his daughter?\r\nCedric troubled, sternly answered: “She is mine,\r\nIndeed, my Zola.” How learned the young man of\r\nHer presence on the mountain? Had he met\r\nHer? Had they met clandestinely? Gilbert,\r\nSpeaking plainly, said: Tho’ strangers,\r\nYet they knew each other well; he long had\r\nWorship’d her afar; well she knew and well\r\nHad she evaded him. Now, at last, had\r\nHe found the one to ask if he might meet and\r\nWoo her, would he give consent? Cedric saw\r\nHis good intent, sincerity and truth,\r\nLooked upon him with the feeling of the\r\nFather for the son. Then like a phantom\r\nCame that secret terror of his life,--he\r\nSpoke unlike himself--severe, unkindly.\r\n“She obeys her father’s will and he would\r\nWill that she remain unseen, unknown\r\nTo strange intruder. The young man makes bold\r\nIn asking.”\r\n\r\n              Answered Gilbert, manfully:\r\n“May not a true heart be emboldened by\r\nThe hope of winning one so beautiful?\r\nThe asking honorable? Perchance the\r\nSeñor has himself in days gone by made\r\nLike request?” Spoke of his family\r\nOld and honored, lived on the Gilbert rancho\r\nIn the valley. Would he offer them rebuke\r\nUnwittingly? Cedric by his words the\r\nMore determined they should never meet, for\r\nZola’s sake and his, resolved to flee\r\nWith her, so spoke deceitfully. He must\r\nGo and wait six days and on the seventh\r\nCome; if she were there then he might speak with\r\nHer. Gilbert said respectfully: “’Tis well!\r\nWith such a hope I well may add to my\r\nLong waiting one more week.” And with a smile\r\nOf hopefulness, he rode away. Cedric\r\nPitying, watched him disappear among\r\nThe ceanothus bloom and drooping boughs.\r\n\r\n    Zola coming, on her face the look of\r\nSadness,--signs of weeping,--Cedric knowing\r\nNow the secret of the change in her--the\r\nAbsence of the rippling laughter noticed\r\nIn the months gone by--his kind heart melted\r\nAnd well-nigh did he repent and tell her\r\nAll, tell Gilbert; but the specter haunting\r\nFixed his purpose; she must go or face a\r\nDeeper sorrow. So, despite his feeling,\r\nSmilingly and cheerful, told her they would\r\nGo and sail across the ocean--sail to\r\nForeign lands. Thus seeking to beguile and\r\nTurn her from the tie that bound her heart to\r\nPalomar, spake he of the people and\r\nThe sights that they would see. Long had they\r\nRemained in Nature’s parlor; now going,\r\nWould they view the halls and palaces of\r\nSplendor they had read about. She smiling\r\nSadly, kissed and thanked him for his kindness.\r\n\r\n    She daily strolled where she had seen the face\r\nOf Gilbert, vainly waiting with the hope\r\nThat he would come once more--pensively, with\r\nTears--and prayed that she might see him once\r\nAgain before she went away. The sun\r\nFrom out its saffron-tinted bed burst forth\r\nAnd kissed the mountain peaks. She weeping, heard\r\nThe matin song of birds and cooing doves,\r\nThe melody of Nature’s minstrelsy--\r\nHeard, and yet not heard, for today must she\r\nDecide among her treasures, which to take\r\nAnd which to leave behind. Came Zimbo and\r\nHer pets for breakfast from her hand, the last\r\nBut one, for early on the morrow she\r\nWould go. “Shall we never come again to\r\nThis dear spot?” she asked. Cedric feigning\r\nCheerfulness, his sadness ill-concealed,--ran\r\nOn assuringly: “Of course, we will return\r\nAnd rest from our long journey ’round the world;\r\nCome, bring your bric-a-brac, my girl, and we\r\nWill pack it snugly in the cabin, bar\r\nThe doors and leave all safe and sound. We may\r\nFind Zimbo and the other pets all waiting\r\nWhen we come. Cheer up, my darling; dry your\r\nTears, for wondrous sights are waiting for those\r\nEyes to feast upon.” Thus talking, while he\r\nPacked her treasures in the hidden cabin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MIDNIGHT RIDE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Gilbert, sleepless, counted yet the slowly\r\nDragging hours--three more days, and then\r\nThe promised one; pondered o’er the words of\r\nThat strange man on Palomar,--words so oft\r\nRepeated: “If she be here, then you may\r\nSpeak with her.” “_If she be here!_” Their meaning--\r\nHis intention--dawned upon him. “She will\r\n_Not be there!_” In frantic haste he rose and\r\nThrew his saddle on his fastest horse and\r\nSent the spurs along his quivering flanks;\r\nHis adolescent blood in angry throbs,\r\nHis eyes ablaze, he wildly flew across\r\nThe mesa, through the foothills, brave Bonita\r\nStag’ring, bore him up the trail. In early\r\nMorning came to where he spoke with Cedric.\r\n\r\n    On the slope he saw the tethered burros,\r\nWell-filled packs and camping equipage near\r\nBy. Then from the curtained maze of trailing\r\nVines and boughs, he heard the gurgling waters\r\nOf the spring and sound of axe. Pressing thro’\r\nHe came upon the hidden cabin, Cedric\r\nPlacing bars before the door, and Zola\r\nBy his side. At sight of him came bounding\r\nZimbo, stop’d by Zola’s voice. Then, with head\r\nUncovered--bowed, as one in reverential\r\nAttitude before a shrine--addressed her:\r\n“We have been acquainted long, if not by\r\nSpoken word, then by the cords that bind two\r\nHearts as one. This man who calls you daughter,\r\nHe may tell you of his promise--explain\r\nThe breaking--doubting not his motive, I\r\nBelieve him kind and true.”\r\n\r\n                          “_Calls you daughter!_”\r\nSmote poor Cedric’s soul; a deadly pallor\r\nSwept across his kindly face. The time had\r\nCome when he must speak--must tell the secret\r\nOf his life--her life. Then he recited\r\nAll that he remembered,--Zola’s unknown\r\nParentage; his stealing her, and fear that\r\nShe be taken; how he had suffered with\r\nThe dread of making known to her that he\r\nWas not her father. Speaking, the strong man\r\nBreaking, wept. Her love and true devotion\r\nSetting all aside, she sprang to him and\r\nClinging, cried: “_He is my own dear father!_”\r\nHer dazzling beauty now intensified.\r\n\r\n    As one enchanted, Gilbert looked upon\r\nThe scene; such filial love revealed a depth\r\nOf soul beyond his ken; thought he of those\r\nWho called him son--what they had done for him--\r\nAnd of the promise he had made to them.\r\nYes, he would die for them; yet in their pride\r\nOf name and family might they not spurn\r\nThis nameless one? Thus in the balance weighed\r\nHis love for her was satisfied; fortune,\r\nName and family were all as naught to\r\nHim compared with Zola. He proudly asked\r\nAgain to woo the hermit’s daughter and\r\nWinning, give to her his name.\r\n\r\n                                “No, no,” she\r\nAnswered for the father, “until this cloud\r\nIs lifted--mystery solved--my name is\r\nZola Vaughn.” With her words, a light broke in\r\nOn Gilbert. Joyously he spoke; as he\r\nHad promised would he go back to the states\r\nAnd seek a bride, solve the mystery and\r\nReturn triumphant, claim her--his Zola--\r\nAs his bride. Would take the ship now in\r\nThe harbor, sail tomorrow. Cedric gave\r\nThe name of Colonel Vail, but his memory\r\nYielded meagerly of information\r\nNeeded. He well remembered all his life\r\n_Up to_ the day that he left Lola at\r\nHer father’s home, and _from_ the day she died,\r\nThe gap between in mystery wrapt, all blank.\r\nGilbert, taking Cedric’s hand, said: “From this\r\nDay your life shall be a pattern for my\r\nOwn. God bless you.” And to Zola: “You are\r\nMine whate’er my journey may reveal;” and\r\nUnmindful of her sweet rebuke, he held\r\nHer to his breast and kissed her. That life-long\r\nFear for her still haunting, Cedric followed\r\nHim aside and whispered: “The father, if\r\nHe be found, pray name her not to him.” From\r\nThe mountain top she watched him out of sight;\r\nThen, alone on Palomar, the hermit’s\r\nDaughter wept.\r\n\r\n                  When their only son went forth\r\nTo seek a bride--to keep his vow--there was\r\nGreat rejoicing at the Gilbert rancho.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGILBERT’S JOURNEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n    After journey long and wearisome, he\r\nReached the Crescent City and the home of\r\nColonel Vail. The aged man now mellowed\r\nBy weight of years, remorseful, mourning\r\nAnd alone, received him kindly, answered:\r\n“Her father’s name was Simon Blake, he was\r\nMurdered by a Mexican upon the\r\nDock. The child, my grandchild’s name was Blake.\r\nThe man who loved my daughter came and found her\r\nDying. ’Twas he who took the child away,\r\nAnd they were lost at sea.” Gilbert had the\r\nStory of her life--her name was Zola\r\nBlake.\r\n\r\n    With heavy heart he homeward turned, yet\r\nNo less loyal to his Zola. With sad\r\nMisgivings waited for the coming of\r\nThe ship--long overdue--by stormy sea\r\nKept back. Waiting, pondered gloomily; he\r\nMust go and bear the tidings that would solve\r\nThe mystery of her name, but leave a\r\nDarker shadow than before. Still would she\r\nRefuse his name they would go away from\r\nPalomar. They at the rancho, left so\r\nHappily, what would he say to them? At\r\nLast with tattered sail and broken, came\r\nThe ship. He hastening, learned that it would\r\nLay at anchor there yet two days more in\r\nMending. Hopeless, yet with strange desire to\r\nLinger there, again he visited the\r\nHospital where Zola’s mother died; but\r\nAs before, no voice could answer aught of\r\nHer; yet caught a thread of hope--an aged\r\nPriest in near-by parish _might_ remember.\r\n\r\n    The father heard him,--listened eagerly;\r\nThen in his book of records found the date\r\nWhen Lola Vail and Cedric Vaughn were wed;\r\nAnd the christening of her daughter--their child.\r\nLeft with him for Cedric, left by Lola,\r\nThe treasure he had brought from Mexico,\r\nLola’s diary, presents he had given,\r\nAnd a miniature of Cedric done by\r\nHer own hand; then to the house where they were\r\nMarried and her resting place. Gilbert took\r\nThe proof to Colonel Vail and together\r\nThey rejoiced. He begged that he would bring his\r\nGrandchild there when they were wed, and Cedric\r\nVaughn, that he might grasp the hand of that true\r\nMan. Now, to Gilbert’s happy heart attuned\r\nBy hope’s fruition, Nature brought a new\r\nGlad song. The bird notes rang with sweeter\r\nMelody--sunshine brighter--bluer skies--\r\nEven in the tumbling troughs of ocean’s\r\nDepth, he read the mirrored light of love and\r\nJoy. Thro’ long and dreary days beneath a\r\nTropic sun,--in calm, or fog, or buffeted\r\nBy winds adverse, the good ship sped ’til thro’\r\nThe mild Pacific’s purple haze, Point\r\nLoma came in view and then, across the\r\nMesa, to the hacienda, _home again_.\r\n\r\n    With mysterious air, and teasing told,\r\nOr partly told the story. Yes; he had\r\nFound a fairy queen and when again the\r\nGreat round moon came o’er the mountain top, she,\r\nRiding on its silvery beams, would come in\r\nState,--would come with him--come to the rancho.\r\nThey must “’bide-a-wee” and trusting him, wait\r\nPatiently. So he left them wondering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\n    To Palomar he flew--told all that he\r\nHad learned--laid the proof before them--described\r\nThe house where Cedric lived--told of the battle on\r\nThe dock--how Morales died--the bags of\r\nGold from Mexico. Thus aided, Cedric\r\nWoke as from a dream, remembered all; then\r\nPlacing Zola’s hand in his, withdrew to\r\nBe alone with sacred memories.\r\n\r\n                                        Hand\r\nIn hand the lovers blissful roved among\r\nThe crags and overhanging boughs where she\r\nHad watched unseen, for him. Led him thro’ the\r\nBrake, in forest solitudes, where lemon\r\nLilies nestling grow, and clinging vines\r\nAnd nodding ceanothus plumes bedrape\r\nThe foliage in Nature’s millinery.\r\n\r\n    With love and kisses roamed until the day\r\nWhen proudly and triumphant, Gilbert led\r\nThem thro’ the avenues of spreading palms and\r\nVine-clad arches of the hacienda.\r\nHis mother welcomed her with tears of joy,\r\n“Her daughter”--then met the fathers--met in\r\nGlad surprise--for Cedric Vaughn and Homer\r\nLee stood face to face; again renewed the\r\nOld time bonds of love and friendship made the\r\nStronger.\r\n\r\n              Then came another presence on\r\nThe scene. Radiant in the ripened bloom\r\nOf womanhood--as beautiful as in\r\nThe happy days of old--came Dora Lee\r\nTo welcome Cedric Vaughn and Lola’s child.\r\n\r\n    On the Gilbert rancho (named for him), in the\r\nDreamy quiet of a summer eve, while\r\nSoftly chimed the distant mission bells,\r\nAt the hacienda, sweet Zola Vaughn\r\nAnd Gilbert Lee were wed. And when the\r\nAutumn came, and vine, and bough and field gave\r\nForth their richest fruitage, and falling leaves\r\nBetokened ripeness--the sure reward\r\nOf patient waiting--two faithful souls were\r\nJoined as one. Again rang forth the silvery\r\nChime of wedding bells--old mission bells--that\r\nEchoed from the gilded cross above its\r\nHoary walls, a benediction sweet as\r\nIncense from its altars.\r\n\r\n                              Long, long ago\r\nBack to the happy scenes of youth they sailed,\r\nAnd left the hidden cabin to decay.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                              A New Book\r\n\r\n                             Up the Grade\r\n\r\n                                  BY\r\n\r\n                           DAVID W.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks."
