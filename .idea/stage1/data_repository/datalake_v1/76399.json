It was well for the flunkey that his functions ceased\r\nat the door. His wind would have failed before he reached the fifth\r\nstory of the old building on Fifth Avenue overlooking Madison Square.\r\n\r\nEllen prided herself on her ability to climb. Those long flights of\r\nstairs were a daily challenge to her splendid body. It was one of her\r\nfavorite amusements to watch the perspiration slowly suffuse the face\r\nof a male escort as he mounted them.\r\n\r\nA late admirer who was short, stout and bald, had frankly given out at\r\nthe top of the third flight, sat down and mopped his brow and shining\r\npate.\r\n\r\n“Great God--is there another?” he faltered.\r\n\r\n“Courage, brother--just one more!” Ellen laughed.\r\n\r\nThe climb dampened his spirits. He left early without a proposal.\r\n\r\nRandolph Field, the author, her next door neighbor of the fifth floor,\r\nwas doing the honors below as the guests arrived.\r\n\r\n“Take your time, ladies and gentlemen,” he called cheerfully, “just\r\nfour flights up and you’ll be nearer heaven than many of you have ever\r\nbeen before, or will be again, unless you return to do homage to the\r\ngoddess who dwells above.”\r\n\r\nLucy Sheldon, the happy little editor of The Woman’s Columns in the\r\nHolt newspapers, was just entering in time to catch this announcement.\r\n\r\nShe lifted her slender figure in protest.\r\n\r\n“If you don’t make Ellen put an elevator in this building, Randy, I’ll\r\nnever come again--I solemnly swear it!”\r\n\r\nField fixed her with a quizzical look.\r\n\r\n“You really want a lift?”\r\n\r\n“I certainly do----”\r\n\r\nHe glanced out the door with one eye and swept the stairs with the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n“There is nobody looking--you shall have it----”\r\n\r\nBefore she could protest he seized her in his arms and mounted the\r\nstairs as if he were carrying a doll.\r\n\r\nToo surprised to struggle the distinguished woman editor could only\r\nlaugh and blush.\r\n\r\nHe placed her squarely on her feet at the top of the last step and\r\nsmiled impudently into her scarlet face.\r\n\r\n“How was that?”\r\n\r\n“Splendid,” she answered, smoothing the wrinkles from her dress. She\r\nhad recovered her poise and was studying the slight figure of the man\r\nwith new interest.\r\n\r\n“I had no idea you were so strong, Randy----” She paused and gazed at\r\nhim in frank admiration. “Your muscles must be made of steel----”\r\n\r\nHe drew his compact figure to its full height, clicked his heels and\r\nsaluted military fashion.\r\n\r\n“Thanks, Lucy, I appreciate the compliment from you, the most ethereal,\r\nthe most daintily spiritual of all the women in the big fight to-day. I\r\nwonder that you knew a man had muscles at all----”\r\n\r\nShe stopped him with a quick gesture.\r\n\r\n“Go back to your work, Mr. Doorman!”\r\n\r\nWith a wave of his hand and a smile of vanity in his strength Field\r\nrapidly descended the stairs and reached the door in time to see the\r\nbig car of Edwin Brown, the young millionaire, stop at the curb.\r\n\r\nHe scowled at the royal blue vision. What the devil could the man be\r\ndoing at this reception? Sylvester, his personal attorney, sat beside\r\nhim, the chauffeur and liveried footman in front.\r\n\r\nHe couldn’t have been invited. Ellen West not only did not know him,\r\nshe had expressed the most positive dislike for him and all his breed\r\nof flesh-hunting loafers.\r\n\r\nHe had, of course, taken advantage of her generous announcement that as\r\na leader of the new Democracy her doors were always open to every man\r\nand woman on these occasions.\r\n\r\nField’s first impulse was to refuse him admission. On second thought it\r\nwould not do. Ellen West would resent his interference. She had made\r\nthe announcement of her new code of democracy with unusual emphasis in\r\nthe invitation to her reception to-night.\r\n\r\nShe had given the function in recognition of her election as president\r\nof the New Democracy Club. The organization was but a year old, yet\r\nnumbered on its roster the names of hundreds of the men and women who\r\nwere making history.\r\n\r\nField recalled with a frown the startling sentences from Ellen’s\r\nsensational articles on marriage in _The New Era_ magazine which\r\nhad led to her election as president. These articles had been taken as\r\nthe creed of the advanced feminist movement in America. The sensation\r\nwhich they had created was profound. They were athrob with passion and\r\nrevolutionary thought.\r\n\r\n“America,” she boldly declared, “is one tremendous leap from ancient\r\nobsession into activity and creative power. The young womanhood of\r\nAmerica dares to dream of a feminine culture which shall give a\r\npositive contribution to the world.\r\n\r\n“Sex freedom is the supreme goal of the modern woman’s movement. The\r\nwoman who is in earnest, the woman who really thinks and feels, who is\r\ndetermined to fight for the rights of her sex, must demand freedom and\r\nindependence. Freedom from the moral dominion of man she must have. She\r\nmust not be smothered by his customs or personality.\r\n\r\n“I, too, with my ancestors claim the right to life, liberty and\r\nthe pursuit of happiness--the fullest, deepest life--the truest\r\nliberty--happiness that thrills both soul and body with inspiring\r\nuplift.\r\n\r\n“The present woman’s struggle is more far-reaching than any in human\r\nhistory. It means more to humanity. Let us not be surprised if it\r\nsurpasses in fanaticism any war of religion or race. The conflict of\r\nthe ages is now on between the life of the soul in woman and the life\r\nof the family. Woman must develop a soul if the future man is worthy to\r\nlive. The woman of to-day has no soul.\r\n\r\n“The woman movement--the last word of the new democracy of the\r\nworld--must destroy the family as the organic group of human society\r\nand replace it with the free individual. We aim, therefore, to suppress\r\nlegal and sacerdotal marriage and substitute a free alliance. Only thus\r\ncan woman develop her personality.”\r\n\r\nAs Field’s quick mind recalled the final words of Ellen West’s creed he\r\ncaught the meaning of Brown’s impudent personal call.\r\n\r\nA daring sensualist in a new free democracy of individuals, he would\r\nclaim his day in court!\r\n\r\nThe footman was still fumbling the door of the limousine. His master\r\nwas looking at his watch, undecided as to another call before he\r\nhonored Ellen with his presence.\r\n\r\n“Another call to see one of his prospective woman parasites!” Field\r\nmuttered.\r\n\r\nThe gossip of the Rialto credited him with half a dozen prospective\r\nconquests long before he had tired of the current alliances. At least\r\nhe was generous. The women who boasted his friendship--or blushingly\r\nadmitted it to a favored few--sang his praises. He spent his money like\r\na prince and he had a positive genius for pleasing women.\r\n\r\nField hated the sound of his name. He hated him for his successes with\r\nwomen. He hated him still more cordially for the enormous power he\r\nwielded through his money. A sensualist and materialist himself, he\r\nfelt instinctively that such a man could only win a woman’s favor by\r\nhis power to buy. On the other hand, as a struggling author he must\r\ndepend on the magnetism of his personality, his wit, his keen sense of\r\nwoman’s weaknesses and the strength of his mind and compact, powerful,\r\nif small body.\r\n\r\nHe hated Brown to-night for a more important reason. He was afraid of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nEllen West had stirred him of late as no woman since the days of his\r\nstormy youth. The fact that she had held him at arm’s length, teasing\r\nhim at the same time, had only made his determination to win her the\r\nmore desperate.\r\n\r\nTo-night he had planned to take her by storm. He had the advantage over\r\nthe entire field until this interloper had suddenly appeared.\r\n\r\nLloyd Bridges, the long-haired poet of passion, had been in love with\r\nher for six months, and had devoted the entire output of his verse to\r\nher praises. In the meantime he had been evicted from his apartment for\r\ndefault in the rent. Field was sorry for Lloyd. So was Ellen. She liked\r\nhis verse, dissecting it as literature, but ignored its personal appeal\r\nwith smiling indifference.\r\n\r\nField knew why. Bridges was effeminate. A long-haired man could never\r\nappeal to a real woman.\r\n\r\nThere was no sort of doubt about Ellen West being a real woman. She was\r\nnot only tall and beautiful--she was voluptuously beautiful. Her whole\r\npersonality radiated sex and the challenge of sex. And the sparkle in\r\nthe deeps of her luminous brown eyes glowed with the consciousness of\r\nher powers.\r\n\r\nIt was unthinkable that this superb woman with her brilliant mind and\r\nbeautiful body could be tempted by a loafer’s millions!\r\n\r\nAnd yet Field was uneasy. He saw Brown end his hesitation in a quick\r\ngesture of command and alight from the car.\r\n\r\nAn unspeakable rage choked him. At least he wouldn’t show the\r\nflesh-hunter in. The fool could climb the stairs without guidance. He\r\nturned on his heels and rapidly mounted to the top floor.\r\n\r\nBridges was doing the honors at the door of Ellen’s apartment, calling\r\nthe name of each guest in his most musical and impressive tones. On\r\neach announcement he would glance over the heads of the crowd to the\r\nhostess in search of her smile.\r\n\r\n“Say, for God’s sake, Bridges,” Field whispered as he entered, “stop\r\ngrinning like a chessy-cat at Ellen every time you call a name. She’s\r\ngrateful. Don’t demand a medal every time you open your big mouth. Have\r\na heart--have a heart!”\r\n\r\nBefore Bridges could answer in his slow, good-natured way, Field\r\ncontinued fiercely:\r\n\r\n“The dirty loafer, Edwin Brown, is on the way up. I hope he dies of\r\napoplexy on the stairs. Don’t announce the pup. His presence here\r\nto-night is an insult to Ellen, which every man should resent. Don’t\r\nannounce him.”\r\n\r\nBridges began to stammer in protest.\r\n\r\n“Don’t stutter!” Field cried. “Do as I tell you or I’ll gag you!”\r\n\r\nThe poet drew himself up with sudden decision.\r\n\r\n“I don’t agree with you, Randy. Let Brown come by all means. Ellen will\r\nonly make of him her footstool. You don’t understand such things with\r\nyour gross material view of life.”\r\n\r\nField flung himself into the crowd and moved instinctively toward the\r\ncenter of the room where Ellen stood by a group of women of the new era\r\nof radical thought.\r\n\r\nLucy Sheldon, her most loyal admirer, though disagreeing on the one\r\nsubject of marriage, was assisting her in the formalities of the\r\nevening. Each guest, if personally unknown to the distinguished young\r\nhostess, whispered the name into Lucy Sheldon’s ear and a graceful\r\nintroduction followed.\r\n\r\nMary Spalding, the historian, stood watching the eloquent changing\r\nface with keen interest and admiration.\r\n\r\nJane Walton, who had made herself famous in municipal reform work,\r\nwas still discussing with her the latest phase of the white slave\r\ntraffic when Lucy presented the short stout figure of a fine-looking\r\ngrey-haired woman of sixty.\r\n\r\n“The Rev. Anna Royce--Miss West.”\r\n\r\n“I feel so poor and humble, Dr. Royce,” she cried, “when I look on your\r\nbeautiful white hair, grown grey in the service of the great cause.”\r\n\r\nThe fine eyes of the woman crusader grew dim for a moment as she\r\npressed the warm hand of the younger leader.\r\n\r\n“I am content, dear child,” she slowly replied. “I have fought a good\r\nfight. I have kept the faith. Younger and stronger hands will carry\r\nit on to final victory. I glory in you. I am here to-night to say God\r\nbless you and keep you always strong to do His will in the new uplift\r\nof Humanity.”\r\n\r\nEllen tried in vain to hold her. But she laughed and nodded and passed\r\non into the throng. Others crowded behind her.\r\n\r\nThey were all here to-night--the feminine leaders of the new thought\r\nthat sweeps the century: Dr. Elizabeth Price, President of the Women’s\r\nMedical College; Emily Willard, the artist; Margaret Moore, the latest\r\nsensation in the dramatic world, with three plays running on Broadway;\r\nthe Hon. Martha Mason, the new Mayor of Koskosia; Beatrice Moreland,\r\nthe young heiress of millions, whose eloquence in behalf of woman’s\r\nsuffrage had stirred the Old and New World; and darting from group to\r\ngroup with tireless energy was Mrs. Eleanor Bishop, a leader of New\r\nYork’s four hundred.\r\n\r\nThe hour marked the supreme triumph in Ellen West’s eventful life.\r\nBarely twenty-seven years old, she had in five years fought her way\r\nfrom the poverty and obscurity of Washington Square into fame and\r\nfortune.\r\n\r\nHer radiant personality to-night quivered with the consciousness of her\r\ntriumph--its strength and solid achievement. Her position as editor\r\nof _The New Era_ was secure--her salary six thousand a year. The\r\nowners of the magazine were a group of modern women leaders, rich in\r\ntheir own name. Each of them swore by the daring and sensational young\r\nwriter, whose brilliant essays, in their opinion, were shaking the\r\nfoundations of the old order of society.\r\n\r\nAlice Clark, the President of the New Era Publishing Company, had just\r\npaused and whispered:\r\n\r\n“You’re glorious to-night, my child! Every woman in America is proud of\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nEllen lifted her graceful head in protest while she flushed with pride.\r\n\r\n“Take care you don’t hold a meeting of the Board of Directors soon and\r\nwarn me to be more conservative.”\r\n\r\n“Not even if we grow as prosperous as the _Ladies’ Home Journal_!”\r\n\r\n“God save us from such a fate,” Ellen laughed.\r\n\r\nFrom every quarter of the big brown room admiring eyes were focused\r\non the heroine of the evening, and from her smiling response it was\r\neasy to guess that she knew the measure of her triumph and prized it\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nShe was conscious not only of the achievement of success from the old\r\npoint of view, but the thing that stirred the depths of her being\r\nwas the certainty that her mind and personality were creating a new\r\nforce in the ferment of American life. The first article of her creed\r\nwas that America, freed from the strangling conventions of the old\r\ncivilization of Europe, must lead Humanity into new paths of glory--and\r\nwoman, the last-born child of world democracy, must become the leader\r\nof this mighty movement.\r\n\r\nThe dreamy inspiration of the religious fanatic crept into the brown\r\neyes as she swept the crowd with deliberate calm.\r\n\r\nIn her inner heart she knew that the calm was partly assumed. She was,\r\nin fact, looking for Randolph Field and mildly wondering why he had\r\nhidden himself in the crowd. There was a feud between them, which she\r\nwould have indignantly denied had he accused her of it. Yet in her soul\r\nshe knew it was there. She knew that her voluptuous body had dazzled\r\nthe materialist who lived next door. It amused her to watch his vain\r\nattempts to conceal this infatuation. The certainty of her domination\r\nof this leader of modern realism was the thing which gave keenest zest\r\nto the evening.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the secrets of her appeal to the public\r\nimagination, there could be no sort of doubt about the secret of her\r\nappeal to Field. It was the victory of woman over man--not man in the\r\nabstract, but man the individual--strong, insolent in his strength,\r\nconscious of powers that were cruel and merciless in the struggle of\r\nsex.\r\n\r\nShe had deliberately dressed to-night to accent every point of her\r\nremarkable physical beauty. The low-cut evening dress with its tiny\r\nsilver straps across the full shoulders revealed in all their glory the\r\nfinely moulded neck and arms. And no daring society leader at the opera\r\nhad ever donned a gown which revealed more fully the lines of a perfect\r\nbust.\r\n\r\nEllen West with all her radical views of woman’s work had really no\r\ndesire to prove herself a man. She gloried in her womanhood. In her\r\ninmost woman’s soul she had developed the passionate desire to dominate\r\nman by sheer feminine charm.\r\n\r\nHer affair with Field had been purely a struggle of personality--of\r\nmind and body in woman against mind and body in man. She was\r\nexperimenting with the male animal which Field’s strong character\r\npresented with such persistent challenge.\r\n\r\nFor the past six months he had been calling her daily from the little\r\nbalcony of the fire-escape in the rear. With the agility of a cat he\r\nwould spring through his window, perch on the iron rail and call to her.\r\n\r\nAgainst her protest that he reminded her of an undersized tomcat\r\nprowling on a back yard fence, he replied good-naturedly, accepting\r\nthe taunt as a compliment, and proceeded to imitate a tomcat with such\r\naccuracy that she laughed to the verge of hysterics.\r\n\r\nThere was no such thing as insulting him. It simply couldn’t be done.\r\nTo every jibe and sneer he replied with a grin and turned the attack to\r\nhis own ends. She had ceased to attack him and had begun to enjoy the\r\ntribute to her charm which his persistent admiration implied.\r\n\r\nShe harbored no delusions about his real character. She knew that he\r\nregarded all women as legitimate game for the male hunter. Nor did he\r\nattempt to conceal or palliate his creed of life.\r\n\r\nThe day following one of his gay parties he appeared on the iron\r\nbalcony earlier than usual to apologize for the noise. He never\r\napologized for the party. Nor did she reproach him. Her creed of\r\nindividual freedom forbade it. She had no right to lecture him on his\r\npersonal life--unless he pressed his personal appeal to a point which\r\ngave her this right.\r\n\r\nShe really expected him to do so to-night. He had told her that he had\r\nsomething of grave importance to say. Her curiosity was piqued. She\r\ncouldn’t help wondering how deeply and seriously he could talk about\r\nthe individual sex problem if driven to self-revelation.\r\n\r\nShe searched the crowded room in vain for Field’s compact figure.\r\nHe suddenly appeared at her side, a deep scowl on his usually\r\nimperturbable face.\r\n\r\n“Where have you been hiding?” she asked quietly.\r\n\r\n“You missed me then?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” he questioned sharply.\r\n\r\n“You had something very important to tell me.”\r\n\r\n“You hadn’t forgotten that, either,” he mused with a smile.\r\n\r\n“What’s on your mind, Randy?”\r\n\r\n“Same old trouble--you!”\r\n\r\n“But your scowl--isn’t that unusual?”\r\n\r\n“I’m not scowling!” he snapped.\r\n\r\n“But you were.”\r\n\r\n“Say,” he whispered, gently touching her bare arm, “can’t you shake\r\nthis mob for a minute?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” was the quick reply. “You’ve been awfully nice to-night,\r\nRandy. I appreciate your generous services as my doorman. We’ll slip up\r\nto the roof.”\r\n\r\nShe threaded her way through the throng, smiling and chatting, Field\r\ncarelessly following.\r\n\r\nAt the narrow passage to the roof which led from the outer hall she\r\npaused until he reached her side. Two minutes later they were seated on\r\nthe iron settee beside a tiny fountain, with the star-lit skies of a\r\nperfect June night above.\r\n\r\nA moment’s silence followed.\r\n\r\nField was gazing at her with a serious intensity unusual to his light\r\nbantering habits with women.\r\n\r\n“You know that I’m in love with you, Ellen,” he said at last.\r\n\r\n“Don’t make me laugh, Randy,” she protested.\r\n\r\n“I mean it!” he whispered.\r\n\r\nEllen laughed outright.\r\n\r\n“You don’t know the first meaning of the word love.”\r\n\r\nShe held his gaze firmly and he slowly lowered his with a quizzical\r\nexpression about his full lips.\r\n\r\n“I ought to--I’ve had some experience.”\r\n\r\nAgain she laughed at the audacity of the nimble mind that had leaped\r\nstraight to the point she held against him--and met it with a\r\nconfession.\r\n\r\n“That’s just why I laugh.”\r\n\r\n“But you shouldn’t, Ellen,” he pleaded; “that’s why you shouldn’t. I\r\npay the highest possible tribute. I have known many women in my busy\r\nlife----”\r\n\r\n“Busy’s the word,” she interrupted.\r\n\r\nHe smiled in spite of himself and continued:\r\n\r\n“Of all the women I have ever known then--you are the queen. I’m\r\ntired of the vapid, the inane, the ignorant, the vain. I glory in the\r\nbrilliancy and beauty of your mind----”\r\n\r\n“Sure it’s my mind, Randy?”\r\n\r\nHe hesitated and swept her superb body with an admiring look.\r\n\r\n“I’ll be honest, Ellen--mind and body. The body is the soul after\r\nall--at least its supreme expression. And I want _you_--body and\r\nsoul--want you with a longing that is pain----”\r\n\r\nEllen laid her hand on his with a gesture of command. His deep\r\nearnestness had evidently surprised and stirred her.\r\n\r\n“Stop,” she ordered sharply. “Don’t try to string me, Randy. At least\r\nbe honest with me. You know that you had a dinner party with two girls\r\nand a chum in your place night before last. It ended in the wee hours\r\nbefore dawn.”\r\n\r\nShe looked him squarely in the eye and again he lowered his head.\r\n\r\n“That’s why I’m talking to you seriously to-night, Ellen,” he said with\r\nquiet intensity. “I’m tired of it all--its senseless waste of time\r\nand life; its futility. I’m disgusted with myself for the first time.\r\nYou’ve done this. I’m madly in love with you and I’ve tried to forget\r\nit lately in foolish dissipation. But it’s no use. You’ve got me. I’ll\r\ngive up every girl I’ve ever known on earth if you’ll be mine. I’ll\r\nwork as I’ve never worked, write as I’ve never written the big books of\r\nwhich I’ve dreamed in the best moments I’ve known--will you?”\r\n\r\nA smile played about her full sensitive lips as she looked at him\r\ncuriously.\r\n\r\n“You would really give up the whole string of your pretty girls for me?”\r\n\r\n“On my soul, I swear it!” he cried earnestly.\r\n\r\n“Thanks for the compliment,” she answered slowly. “If I didn’t know\r\nthat you were a hopeless liar and that it is impossible to teach an old\r\ndog new tricks I could almost love you after that speech.”\r\n\r\n“But it’s no use?”\r\n\r\n“Not a bit.”\r\n\r\n“All right, we’ll let it rest at that point for to-night. I’ll ask you\r\nagain to-morrow. In the meantime, I’ve just one favor--a real personal\r\nfavor to beg of you to-night.”\r\n\r\n“Not again that I kiss you, Randy!”\r\n\r\n“No--I’m going to do that by force sooner or later--no; this is more\r\nserious.”\r\n\r\n“What on earth?”\r\n\r\nHe fumbled the lapel of his coat and finally plunged to the point.\r\n\r\n“The loafer, Edwin Brown, is here to-night.”\r\n\r\n“Brown himself?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I just ask you one favor, Ellen; don’t meet the blackguard.”\r\n\r\n“Hoity, toity, man, why should the pot call the kettle black?”\r\n\r\nField drew himself up stiffly.\r\n\r\n“You don’t class me with Brown?”\r\n\r\n“Not exactly, no;” she answered slowly. “He buys with money. You buy\r\nwith wit, superior intelligence, muscle and the charm of personality.”\r\n\r\nField bit his lip and moved uneasily.\r\n\r\n“You will see him?” he asked forlornly.\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” she laughed. “I’m just a little curious to know if the\r\nsecret of his success with women _is_ all due to money.”\r\n\r\n“Of course, it’s money.”\r\n\r\n“There must be a little more.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Otherwise he wouldn’t have the audacity to come to my apartment\r\nto-night in person. And if he has honored me with a personal call,\r\ndon’t you think he deserves a hearing?”\r\n\r\n“I do not!”\r\n\r\n“I do--come--we’ll go down at once.”\r\n\r\nIn spite of his protests she led the way down the narrow stairs into\r\nthe brilliantly lighted room. Brown’s presence had become known in\r\nspite of Bridges’ final decision not to announce him. He stood with\r\nSylvester the center of a group of curious women to whom he had been\r\nintroduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                           THE MAN OF MONEY\r\n\r\n\r\nJUST inside the doorway Field made his final plea. In his impetuous\r\nearnestness he seized Ellen’s arm with violence.\r\n\r\n“Please, Ellen, for the love of heaven,” he begged, “don’t lower\r\nyourself by speaking to that insufferable blackguard.”\r\n\r\nShe withdrew her arm with a touch of resentment.\r\n\r\n“Nonsense, Randy, he is my guest.”\r\n\r\n“He came without an invitation!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, dear boy, he reads the papers--at least he owns one. My\r\nannouncement contained a welcome to every thoughtful man and woman in\r\nNew York. Besides, I’m consumed just now with curiosity to see what he\r\nis really like at close range.”\r\n\r\n“But, Ellen, I’m madly in love with you,” Field interrupted; “I won’t\r\nstand for it!”\r\n\r\nThe tall figure grew a bit taller as her eyes met his.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid you’ll have to stand it,” she said quietly. “I’m not in\r\nlove with you, and if I were I wouldn’t take orders from you. Remember,\r\ndear boy, that I live in the big world--a man’s world. I’m going to\r\nmeet and speak to any human being who interests me. Run along now and\r\ndon’t annoy me.”\r\n\r\nField flung himself suddenly into the crowd and disappeared before she\r\nhad finished speaking.\r\n\r\nLucy Sheldon rushed to meet her.\r\n\r\n“Where on earth have you been?” she cried.\r\n\r\n“On the roof listening to Randy’s fool love-making,” was the frank\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n“Well, you’re fined for disorderly conduct. The caterer is waiting your\r\norders to announce the buffet dinner.”\r\n\r\nEllen drew up both hands in disgust.\r\n\r\n“Tell him to go ahead--what did I hire him for?”\r\n\r\nLucy waved the signal to the caterer, who proceeded to serve the dinner\r\npicnic fashion from the sideboard while his minions filled the glasses\r\nfrom the huge punch bowl on the center table.\r\n\r\n“And what’s more important,” Lucy continued in a stage whisper, “you\r\nhave a very distinguished guest here to-night who is vainly seeking an\r\nintroduction to his hostess.”\r\n\r\n“You mean Edwin Brown?”\r\n\r\n“Of course, silly--next to you he’s the sensation of the evening. May I\r\nintroduce him now?”\r\n\r\nEllen suddenly faced her friend.\r\n\r\n“Lucy Sheldon, do you mean to tell me that you know that man?”\r\n\r\n“And why not?”\r\n\r\n“You--the demure little ingenue defender of the home and champion of\r\nall the old-fashioned virtues in women?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly--he’s one of my best friends--gave me my first job on a\r\nnewspaper in New York and gave me the letter to Holt, his big rival,\r\nthat got my permanent job--what of it?”\r\n\r\nThe ugly thought that crept into Ellen’s mind for a moment was\r\ndismissed with a laugh.\r\n\r\n“Oh, nothing, dear; you’re too innocent for this world. I’ve told you\r\nthat before, I think.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll meet him now?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, I’m curious to know him.”\r\n\r\nA minute later she returned with Brown. The meeting was a distinct\r\nshock to Ellen West. A man of more striking and charming appearance she\r\nhad never met. The shock upset her preconceived ideas of the typical\r\nflesh-hunter of whom she had heard much and read more. He walked with\r\nan easy swing that provoked comradeship. His tall, finely moulded\r\nfigure suggested strength and poise of character. The distinctly\r\nhandsome face wore a winning smile that refused to come off in the\r\npresence of a beautiful woman. His clothes fitted to perfection, yet\r\nleft no suggestion of fine dress. Good-natured, jovial, conscious of\r\npower, but without the slightest trace of insolence, he extended his\r\nhand with a simple speech that disarmed her.\r\n\r\n“I really must beg your pardon, Miss West, for this intrusion to-night,\r\nbut I was so anxious to meet you I couldn’t resist the temptation to\r\naccept your democratic announcement--if for no other reason than to\r\nteach you how dangerous such an innovation might be--am I forgiven?”\r\n\r\n“There is nothing to forgive, I assure you. I meant every word of my\r\ndemocratic creed in that invitation.”\r\n\r\n“Then I shall be very happy to-night,” he replied, bending low.\r\n\r\n“But why this overwhelming desire to meet me personally?” Ellen asked\r\nwith a mischievous twinkle in her eyes. “I’ve heard that your tastes\r\nran to the ingenue type!”\r\n\r\nHe laughed heartily but made no protest.\r\n\r\n“It may be true. I never dispute the gossips. I’m more honored by their\r\nattentions than I deserve. Whatever trend a man’s taste may have taken\r\nin the past you will admit that a new woman has arrived.”\r\n\r\n“And you have come to appraise her?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly. And I don’t mind telling you that my impressions are\r\noverwhelmingly favorable.”\r\n\r\nEllen smiled at his boyish emphasis and evident sincerity.\r\n\r\n“Thank you!” she said with a touch of irony.\r\n\r\n“I mean it--and mind you, these impressions had to come along some\r\npretty rough road before they settled. You know a man has been taught\r\nfrom childhood to trail the ‘nice’ girls. You’re a very disturbing\r\nyoung woman. You do a lot of things that make a fellow sit up and take\r\nnotice.”\r\n\r\n“For instance?”\r\n\r\nHe looked at her with frank admiration, a smile twinkling about the\r\ncorners of his steel grey eyes, and deliberately swept the room\r\nsearching for a way out.\r\n\r\n“Could we get away from the crowd?” he asked appealingly.\r\n\r\nShe threw him a quick look of surprise as he went on eagerly:\r\n\r\n“Would you honor me with a few minutes’ quiet talk if it’s not asking\r\ntoo much? The animals are all feeding now. They won’t miss you.”\r\n\r\nShe hesitated and said:\r\n\r\n“Certainly, come up on my roof. I’ve a little nook of a garden up\r\nthere.”\r\n\r\n“Splendid!” he whispered.\r\n\r\nShe led him through the main doorway into the dimly lighted hall and\r\nup the narrow stairs to the identical seat beside the fountain on which\r\nshe had chatted with Field twenty minutes before.\r\n\r\nShe repressed a laugh at the expense of mere man. She was studying the\r\nanimal at close range. It had just dawned on her--the full significance\r\nof Field’s desperate love-making, of Bridges’ endless sighs, of\r\nBrown’s audacity--they had each read into her final article on the\r\n“Free Alliance as a Substitute for Marriage” an invitation to make\r\nthe personal experiment. The driveling idiots--as if she must thus\r\nadvertise for a man!\r\n\r\nShe sat down on the iron seat, her nerves quivering with suppressed\r\nrage. Brown walked to the edge of the little garden, looked across the\r\nmoonlit square toward the Metropolitan tower and up at the star-lit\r\nsky. The movement enabled him to glance into every nook and corner of\r\nthe place and make sure that they were alone.\r\n\r\nEllen’s keen eye had caught the side glances.\r\n\r\n“How quiet and beautiful it is up here!” he exclaimed. “Your own idea\r\nto fix this old roof into a garden, I’ll bet?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I write here when the weather’s fine,” she answered.\r\n\r\nHe drew a chair in front of her and threw his tall figure into it with\r\nan easy swinging grace and looked for a moment at her with deliberate\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\n“Would it surprise you, Miss West,” he began slowly, “if I told you\r\nthat my call was made to-night with the most serious intentions?”\r\n\r\n“Very much,” she answered emphatically.\r\n\r\n“It’s true,” he went on musingly. “You have not only interested me\r\nenormously as a passing sensation----”\r\n\r\n“Passing is good!” she interrupted.\r\n\r\n“I mean, of course, from the newspaper point of view,” he apologized,\r\n“but your personality, which seems to contradict your theories, has\r\ninterested me far more.”\r\n\r\n“Really?”\r\n\r\n“Honestly.”\r\n\r\n“And we have known each other just fifteen minutes.”\r\n\r\nHe shook his head in protest.\r\n\r\n“Pardon me. I have known you for more than a year.”\r\n\r\nEllen frowned.\r\n\r\n“I don’t get the point of your joke,” she answered drily.\r\n\r\n“No joke, I assure you,” he went on briskly. “From the day I heard you\r\naddress a crowd in Union Square--a little more than a year ago--I have\r\nread every line that you have written and attended every meeting at\r\nwhich you have spoken.”\r\n\r\n“Incognito?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not. This is a big village, Miss West. When I dismiss my car\r\nI go where I please and do as I please. The crowd doesn’t know or care\r\nwho I am. You have been the most puzzling study of the past year. When\r\nI see you sway a throng of eager listeners, discussing the history of\r\nsuffrage and the abstract principles of democracy, there’s something\r\ncold and steel-like in you that repels and yet provokes the deepest\r\ninterest. I’ve heard you discuss the management of maternity hospitals,\r\nthe sexual meaning of the dance, the segregation of the unfit, the\r\nimprovement of the breed of men by proper mating and the white slave\r\ntraffic with the cold precision of a demonstrator of anatomy pointing\r\nout the different nerves and muscles of the human body in a dissecting\r\nroom.”\r\n\r\n“And still your interest held?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“The funny part is that it grew in intensity. One minute I’ve thought\r\nyou splendid. The next that you were absurd. I’ll swear you were\r\nboth, and yet always alive--alive to your finger tips with a power to\r\ncommunicate the sense of boundless vitality to others. You’ve drawn and\r\nheld me as a magnet. I couldn’t keep away from you----”\r\n\r\nHe leaned forward and gazed at her intently.\r\n\r\n“And so I’m here to-night.”\r\n\r\n“I am honored, I assure you,” she said with a touch of sarcasm.\r\n\r\n“To make myself perfectly plain, Miss West,” he went on evenly, “I love\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nEllen laughed until he began to flush with wounded pride. She lifted\r\nher rounded arms above her head and laughed again.\r\n\r\nHe waited for her to speak.\r\n\r\n“And I am to believe, of course, that I am the first to whom you have\r\never spoken those three magic words?”\r\n\r\n“On the other hand,” he protested seriously, “I scorn so cheap a lie.\r\nTo be honest with you, women have been my chief interest in life. I’ve\r\nnever wasted a minute with them. I’ve always gotten the full value of\r\nboth my time and my money. I’ve lost thousands in bad investments; I’ve\r\nlost hundreds of thousands in Wall Street crazy speculations; I’ve lost\r\nthousands and months of life fooling with vanities; I’ve nothing to\r\nshow for it--but the women I have known and loved----”\r\n\r\nHe paused, smiled and shook his handsome head.\r\n\r\n“They have made life worth living. And because of this I can\r\ntruthfully say that I think our planet a nice place on which to tarry.”\r\n\r\n“At least you have the courage of your convictions,” Ellen observed\r\ndrily.\r\n\r\n“You have been a revelation to me in the possibilities of a higher and\r\nmore beautiful womanhood.”\r\n\r\nShe leaned forward, fixed him with her eyes and spoke with intensity.\r\n\r\n“And how much will you give for me?”\r\n\r\nHe hesitated and fumbled the black-braided watch guard which circled\r\nhis neck, glanced at her uneasily, flushed and was silent.\r\n\r\n“How much?” she insisted sternly.\r\n\r\nHe studied her and answered deliberately.\r\n\r\n“A house on Fifth Avenue, a country place, and a settlement of\r\ntwenty-five thousand a year.”\r\n\r\nThe audacity and magnificence of his offer stunned her.\r\n\r\nThere could be no doubt about his meaning. There could be no doubt\r\nabout his sincerity. His finely shaped hands were trembling and his\r\nvoice quivered with excitement.\r\n\r\nEllen drew a deep breath, folded her arms and studied his face. He had\r\nnot attempted to touch her hand or suggest the slightest liberty. His\r\nfrankness and the poise with which he had announced his Epicurean code\r\nof morals had appealed to her imagination.\r\n\r\nHe straightened his tall figure and waited for her to speak. A long\r\nsilence followed which he broke at last in low tones.\r\n\r\n“All right; we’ll make it fifty thousand a year, if you say the word?”\r\n\r\nAnother silence.\r\n\r\nWhen Ellen spoke at last there were tears in her voice as well as in\r\nher eyes.\r\n\r\n“It would be silly for me to flare up and say that you have insulted\r\nme. As a matter of fact you have not. You have paid me the highest\r\ncompliment you know how to pay a woman. But can’t you see that it is\r\njust this condition of chattel slavery out of which I am struggling\r\nto lift women? For centuries she has been bought and paid for by man,\r\nher master. I have achieved my independence, thank God. Otherwise, I’m\r\nhonest enough to tell you that your offer might have dazzled me. I\r\ndon’t see how the average woman who loves luxury could resist such a\r\nbid----”\r\n\r\nShe paused and laughed softly.\r\n\r\n“From such a bidder.”\r\n\r\nBrown moved in protest.\r\n\r\n“Now wait a minute--you mustn’t joke. We’ve gotten beyond that. We’re\r\nboth in earnest. If I’ve made a mistake, I’ll get right. I’ve taken\r\nyou at your word. You hate conventional marriage?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“That’s why I’ve offered you a free alliance which you could end at a\r\nmoment’s notice and yet maintain your position of wealth and all that\r\npower means. You refuse?”\r\n\r\n“I scorn it.”\r\n\r\n“All right. Will you marry me?”\r\n\r\n“Marry--you?”\r\n\r\n“And why not?”\r\n\r\n“What would you do with your other establishments?”\r\n\r\n“You know that I have them?”\r\n\r\n“I’m sure of it.”\r\n\r\nHe pursed his lips, twisted his fingers with nervous cruelty and\r\nbreathed deeply.\r\n\r\n“You’re not just torturing me, are you?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“I want to see how deeply you are in earnest,” she fenced.\r\n\r\n“You know that I’m in earnest,” he protested.\r\n\r\nAnother silence followed.\r\n\r\n“I think you are,” she said finally. “Otherwise you wouldn’t hesitate\r\nabout giving up your other girls.”\r\n\r\n“You see I had not faced this sort of possibility when I came here\r\nto-night. I didn’t think you were the marrying kind.”\r\n\r\n“And yet if you have read my work you must know that the marriage I\r\nseek is the highest ideal relation of two free men and women. As much\r\nhigher than conventional marriage as heaven is above hell.”\r\n\r\n“But you would have it free, wouldn’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely.”\r\n\r\n“Then wouldn’t you let me see one girl I know occasionally for a short\r\ntime, if I really wished it? I’m fond of her; she didn’t believe that\r\nI’d ever marry. And it wouldn’t be quite the square thing to throw her\r\noverboard without a word--I’ll end it in a month.”\r\n\r\n“You can see as many as you like.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but I want you. I must have you. I never wanted anything quite\r\nso desperately and earnestly in my life and I’ll pay the price if I\r\nmust--anything you demand--will you marry me?”\r\n\r\n“I’m not for sale at any price. When I find the man I love, I shall\r\ngive myself, not sell.”\r\n\r\n“You won’t marry me?” he asked in astonishment.\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\nHe rose quickly.\r\n\r\n“It’s incredible!” he cried impatiently. “Of course I’m spoiled. But\r\nthis is the first big jolt of my life.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll recover.”\r\n\r\n“Of course, I’ve got to--but look here----”\r\n\r\nHe seated himself and touched her arm with the gentlest sort of appeal.\r\n\r\n“You’ll give me a chance with the other fellows to win your love?”\r\n\r\n“And why not?” she answered archly. “You’re really a most agreeable\r\nyoung man now that I’ve seen you at close range. I’ve been wondering\r\nwhy a man of your fine body and mind should waste his talents in\r\nsenseless dissipation?”\r\n\r\n“That’s a fact, isn’t it? Why don’t you reform me?”\r\n\r\nEllen laughed.\r\n\r\n“It doesn’t appeal to me. I’ve more important work to do.”\r\n\r\n“I’d try to make the job agreeable,” he urged. “Honestly I would.”\r\n\r\nEllen rose without reply. He knew that further words would be wasted\r\nand followed her toward the stairway in silence.\r\n\r\nAs they were about to enter the door opening on the stairs he said in\r\nboyish tones:\r\n\r\n“Just one little favor before you disappear in that mob.”\r\n\r\nShe turned toward him.\r\n\r\n“Certainly. What is it?”\r\n\r\n“You have the most exquisitely beautiful hand I have ever seen. In\r\nremembrance of what I’ve said to you to-night, may I kiss it?”\r\n\r\nEllen gazed at him in surprise until he flushed with embarrassment.\r\n\r\n“You are so sentimental.”\r\n\r\n“I confess it.”\r\n\r\nShe extended her hand, he touched it with his own, bent and kissed the\r\ntips of her fingers.\r\n\r\n“I had no idea you could be so silly,” she said lightly.\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” he gravely answered.\r\n\r\nAs they entered the throng below, Lucy Sheldon met her at the door.\r\n\r\n“If Mr. Brown will excuse you now----”\r\n\r\nBrown leaned close to the little woman and whispered:\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Mrs. Sheldon. I’m your debtor for life for a beautiful\r\nevening.”\r\n\r\nWith a nod to Ellen he passed on into the crowd.\r\n\r\n“Where on earth have you been?” Lucy wailed.\r\n\r\n“On the roof again.”\r\n\r\n“At least you escaped sentimental nonsense this time.”\r\n\r\n“I escaped,” Ellen admitted.\r\n\r\n“I’ve the surprise of your life in store for you,” she whispered. “The\r\nman of your dreams is here.”\r\n\r\nEllen smiled indulgently.\r\n\r\n“Lead me to him. The sight will be refreshing.”\r\n\r\nLucy lifted her arm high above her head and waved to a dark, serious\r\nyoung fellow who stood leaning lazily against a balcony column.\r\n\r\nHe nodded in answer and hurried across the room.\r\n\r\nEllen heard his name in a sort of trance. The sight of his strong manly\r\nface and slender wiry figure had stirred suddenly the memories of\r\nchildhood in Maryland. This boy looked like an old playmate except that\r\nhe was dark and the boy of her childhood was blonde. Where had she seen\r\nhim?\r\n\r\n“This is my reckless nephew, Mr. Ralph Manning, who, against my advice,\r\nhas left a good position in the South to butt into metropolitan\r\njournalism.”\r\n\r\nHe took Ellen’s outstretched hand, speaking in a rich Southern voice.\r\n\r\n“And why shouldn’t I, Miss West? If a little lorn widow like my Aunt\r\ncan butt into New York and make her fortune, why can’t a husky young\r\nman who is not afraid of hard work do the same?”\r\n\r\nShe made a conventional reply and continued to study the lines of\r\nManning’s face. Something in the low tones of his voice caught her\r\nheart with a queer grip.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                           THE MAN Of DREAMS\r\n\r\n\r\nELLEN’S first feeling of puzzled surprise and dimly awakened memories\r\nwere followed by a sense of resentment at the consciousness of her keen\r\ninterest in Manning.\r\n\r\nShe had scarcely had a moment to enjoy her triumph over the male animal\r\nwhen a new specimen had entered to rob her of the spiritual fruits of\r\nvictory. Her victory had been complete--both over the man of muscle and\r\nthe man of money.\r\n\r\nThe man of money had profoundly surprised and interested her. She had\r\nimagined him a shallow-brained nonentity. She had found his mind alert,\r\nhis sense of humor keen, his character altogether human and likeable.\r\nBesides, she had distinctly felt the pull of his vigorous manhood. His\r\nenemies were constantly telling the public that he had inherited his\r\nfortune, that he was a weakling incapable of creating values of any\r\nsort, and that such a man was merely a social parasite. Having met and\r\ntalked with him for half an hour she knew that these estimates were\r\nfalse. Lucy Sheldon might be incapable of believing the stories about\r\nhis sensual habits, but her judgment of his mind and the force of his\r\ncharacter was nearer the truth. Her faith was profound that he was one\r\nof the brainiest men in New York, that his genius had more than doubled\r\nhis inherited fortune, and that his ambitions in life were seriously to\r\nbe reckoned with.\r\n\r\nAnd yet she had not for a moment felt the loosening of a single rivet\r\nin the armor of her character under the assault he had so boldly and\r\nskilfully made. The more she had thought of the offer of a settlement\r\nof fifty thousand a year, a house on Fifth Avenue, and a country estate\r\nwith so slight an encumbrance as this tall, handsome, smiling young\r\nsportsman, the more she congratulated herself on her own strength of\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n“Never touched me!” she mused smilingly. Nor had his offer of marriage\r\nwhich followed made any deeper impression, though its full import had\r\nbeen instantly felt. The immense social prestige which the wife of such\r\na man would wield in the money-loving, money-worshipping atmosphere of\r\nNew York was beyond question.\r\n\r\nTo the ordinary woman it would have been a physical and psychological\r\nimpossibility to reject such an offer of marriage offhand. Ellen\r\ncongratulated herself on the distinct advance her character had made\r\nover the average feminine mind.\r\n\r\nAll arguments against the economic independence of women were blown\r\nto atoms by this one fact. It was no longer a question of theory or a\r\nquestion open to argument. She knew. She felt the poise and the power\r\nof personal achievement in her position. Her heart beat high with\r\npride--not mere pride in sex--but pride in the achievement of human\r\ncharacter. Her outlook on life had been broadened and her sympathies\r\ndeepened. Never had she felt the inspiration of her chosen career as a\r\nfeminist leader so full of meaning.\r\n\r\nHer triumph over the man of muscle had been even more gratifying. Of\r\nall the men she had met in New York, Field had really interested her\r\nmost. She had read his books with profound interest. They were of\r\nthe soil, rich in the deep intuitive knowledge of nature which only\r\ngenius can possess. He was one of the few popular writers of the day\r\nwho scorned to stoop to public taste. He wrote under the impulse of an\r\nemotion which he expressed without fear or favor. In spite of his scorn\r\nof commercial popularity his books were popular. Nor was this scorn\r\na mere pose to gain what he pretended to despise. He really despised\r\nthe man who prostitutes this power of expression in any art for the\r\npurpose of earning fame or money. He was the artist born, and his books\r\nwere the genuine expression of a man who worships nature. He heartily\r\nloathed the school of nature fakirs, and he attacked them tooth and\r\nnail, not only in his books in lines of subtle irony, but in essays of\r\nmerciless ridicule, which the literary journals printed with chuckles\r\nof joy.\r\n\r\nHis pursuit of women was notorious among the set in which he moved.\r\nIt often happened that a dinner given in celebration of the success\r\nof one of his books was eaten without the chief figure at the head of\r\nthe table. It got to be such a joke that his best friend ceased to\r\napologize. The dinners were gradually discontinued, much to Field’s\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\nFor a long time his apparent interest in Ellen’s propaganda and his\r\nstudied indifference to her as a woman had hurt her pride. Not that she\r\nexpected or desired his attentions as a man--certainly not! And yet\r\nit had been trying to feel that her beauty, of which she could not be\r\nignorant, had made not the slightest impression on this genuine artist\r\nand devotee of nature.\r\n\r\nFor several months he had dropped into her apartment often to inquire\r\nof the progress of her work. He was not a pronounced feminist. As an\r\nauthor he claimed the right of free criticism of all cults and human\r\nevents. The woman movement to him was merely a world event. It could\r\nnot disturb the even tenor of his intellectual life. She hated him for\r\nhis pose and yet she respected him for it. In her heart of hearts she\r\nknew it was not a pose. He had really attained the poise to which she\r\naspired.\r\n\r\nIt piqued her feminine mind to think that he wasted so much of his\r\nvaluable time in a senseless chase after first one woman and then\r\nanother and yet had shown no disposition to seriously pursue her.\r\n\r\nSomething had upset his poise to-night and he had revealed himself.\r\nHis hatred of Brown no doubt was the cause. The impetuous rush with\r\nwhich he had made love had been a surprise. She had suspected of late\r\nhis growing personal interest in spite of the fact that he had used\r\nmore than usual pains to mask his feelings. He had formed the habit\r\nof calling her from the iron balcony in the rear with increasing\r\nfrequency. Another trick he had developed was the use of the Morse\r\ntelegraph code in tapping out sentences on her wall late at night. Some\r\nof the things he had said were unusually witty and of late his messages\r\nhad been coming at moments when he knew that she was just going to bed.\r\nThere was nothing in these messages to suggest the sensuous, yet the\r\nfact that he was talking to her at this particular time had produced\r\nthe impression that his purpose was to suggest the most daring intimacy.\r\n\r\nTo-night in his love-making he had been charged with the highest\r\ncurrents of magnetism. His compact muscular body had been on fire with\r\npassion. It sparkled from his steel grey eyes. It burned in the touch\r\nof his hand. It throbbed and pulsed in the tone of his insinuating\r\nvoice. For the first time in her life she had felt the fires of pent-up\r\nsex within her own body. She had studied the problem in scientific text\r\nbooks. She had studied it in modern physiology. She had studied it in\r\nthe modern problem novel. To-night temptation had whispered into her\r\ninmost soul for the first time, and she had won. This man of genius was\r\nhers. She had but to speak and he would do her bidding. Nor had she\r\nmuch doubt about holding her own in the battle of sex that would follow\r\na love affair with such a man. She was a type of woman whom he had\r\nnever conquered. She knew instinctively that she could torture him with\r\na jealousy of which she herself was incapable. His fury over Brown’s\r\napproach was proof positive of this.\r\n\r\nShe had won with scarcely an effort. She smiled at her own strength\r\nand thought with a touch of pity of the weakness of man. She\r\ncongratulated herself on the progress which her new creed would make\r\nin the development of the intellectual and physical life of woman. For\r\ncenturies woman had been the slave or toy of man. A new era would dawn\r\nfor humanity when she could stand by his side consciously his equal in\r\nmind and body.\r\n\r\nHer train of thought was broken at last by Manning leaning across the\r\nlittle table at which they were seated and asking in the most serious\r\ntones:\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid I am boring you, Miss West?”\r\n\r\nShe looked at him a moment in, surprise, blushed in spite of her\r\ntriumphant musings, and hastened to reassure him.\r\n\r\n“On the other hand, you don’t know how profoundly you have interested\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nManning laughed a sound, good-humored boyish laugh.\r\n\r\n“You’ve been in a sort of trance ever since we climbed on this balcony.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!” Ellen protested.\r\n\r\nAnd yet she was surprised to find that she had led Manning up the\r\nstairway at the rear of the living room and out on the balcony which\r\noverlooked it. The crowd below seemed the figures in a dream from which\r\nshe was just awakening.\r\n\r\n“The fact is,” Ellen went on, “you started me to dreaming about my\r\ngirlhood in Maryland and a fair-haired boy just like you.”\r\n\r\n“Your first sweetheart?”\r\n\r\n“How did you guess?”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t. I just hoped.”\r\n\r\n“Why hoped?”\r\n\r\n“You said I looked like him.”\r\n\r\nEllen smiled.\r\n\r\n“You’re picking up city ways remarkably early for a country boy, I must\r\nsay.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I was not exactly a farmer.”\r\n\r\nHe paused and showed his white, perfect teeth. For the first time she\r\nbecame conscious of a dignity and strength she had not noticed before.\r\nAgain the curious memory of her childhood returned--the memory of\r\nthe fair-haired, domineering boy who had first stirred her girlish\r\nimagination--the sleepy town with its great live oaks on the shores of\r\nthe Chesapeake--her unhappy father and mother, their endless bickering\r\nand quarrelling--her mother’s never-ending nagging and her father’s\r\neternal martyrdom. She remembered distinctly how she had sworn never\r\nto marry this boy no matter how desperately he might beg her. To her\r\nchild’s mind even then marriage was the one stupid blunder she would\r\nnever commit.\r\n\r\nShe had the sudden crazy idea that Manning was the reincarnation of\r\nthis boy.\r\n\r\n“A penny for your thoughts!” he cried banteringly.\r\n\r\nAgain she was roused from reverie with a start and a blush.\r\n\r\n“Was I off again?”\r\n\r\n“Asleep this time,” he said, with a smile.\r\n\r\nShe ignored his banter and looked at him steadily.\r\n\r\n“I could almost swear that you’re my playmate and that you’ve dyed your\r\nhair to have some fun with me, if I did not know my poor boy had been\r\ndead ten years and I saw them bury him.”\r\n\r\n“All right, then. I don’t mind your memories of the dead. I was afraid\r\nyou were regretting the living from whom my indulgent Aunt had torn\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nAgain she ignored his challenge to polite fencing and looked at him\r\nseriously.\r\n\r\n“Tell me about yourself, why you came here and what you expect to do?”\r\n\r\n“A tale soon told,” he began briskly. “I was late finishing my college\r\ncourse--had to help send the other kids to school and keep my mother’s\r\npantry full of bread. When I did get through I was in debt five hundred\r\ndollars, which I had been lucky enough to borrow. It took me three\r\nyears’ hard work to pay this debt and get a hundred dollars ahead----”\r\n\r\n“How did you make it?” she interrupted.\r\n\r\n“Went on the road as a travelling salesman--not very romantic for a\r\ndreamer of dreams, was it?”\r\n\r\n“No,” she answered, watching him intently.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he continued, “it was the first thing that came and I took it.\r\nI had to pay my debts before I could play with my dreams. I’ve paid my\r\ndebts--I’ve a hundred dollars in my pocket, enough clothes to last me\r\nthrough the season, I’m installed in a little room on Washington Square\r\nand I’ve the dandiest aunt in the world, who brought me here to-night\r\nand introduced me to you!”\r\n\r\n“And what are you going to do?”\r\n\r\n“Write editorials for a big newspaper bye and bye--made a beginning\r\nhere to-night--thanks to your genius in bringing these distinguished\r\nmen and women together.”\r\n\r\n“Made a beginning here?” Ellen repeated.\r\n\r\n“Sure, thanks to you and my aunt I’ve just met Brown. He’s a big man.\r\nI liked, him right off and he liked me too--scribbled a note to the\r\nmanaging editor of his paper and told him to give me a chance as a\r\nspace writer.”\r\n\r\n“When will you begin?” Ellen inquired.\r\n\r\n“I’ve begun. I’m going to write up this reception to-night from a\r\ncountry boy’s point of view.”\r\n\r\nEllen’s eyes sparkled.\r\n\r\n“It ought to make good reading.”\r\n\r\n“It will.”\r\n\r\nHis enthusiasm and faith in himself were contagious. In spite of an\r\neffort to dismiss the young man and return to her guests Ellen found\r\nherself listening enraptured to the story of his ambitions and his\r\nfresh views of men and things in New York. Her guests were leaving\r\nand she was compelled at last to take her place at the door and say\r\ngood-night.\r\n\r\nWithout realizing what she was doing she asked Manning to stay until\r\nthe others had gone. Elated at the unexpected honor, he saw the last\r\nguest save his aunt depart with joy.\r\n\r\nLucy Sheldon was not surprised at his enthusiasm over Ellen, and left\r\nhim with a friendly warning:\r\n\r\n“See that your first effort does justice to Ellen West or never speak\r\nto me again, sir!”\r\n\r\n“Impossible, Auntie,” he whispered, “but I’ll do my best.”\r\n\r\nFor an hour after the crowd had gone Ellen listened to his endless talk\r\nas if he were an oracle delivering the last words on human destiny.\r\nTwice she caught herself in this worshipful attitude and laughed in\r\nsheer disgust, only to return to the same position of rapt attention.\r\n\r\nHe asked if she played the piano. Forgetting that it was after\r\nmidnight, she sat down and played for half an hour while he bent over\r\nher in tense silence. Through the soft tones of an old-fashioned melody\r\nshe caught a telegraphic message through Field’s wall:\r\n\r\n“Say, old pal, have you gone crazy?”\r\n\r\nShe stopped with a sudden laugh.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?” Manning asked innocently.\r\n\r\n“Good gracious, boy, run along home!”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“It’s nearly one o’clock. I’ve got a day’s work before me to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“Can I come to-morrow night?”\r\n\r\nBefore she realized the absurdity of his request and the folly of her\r\nanswer she had said:\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nHe seized his hat and hurried out.\r\n\r\n“All right, to-morrow night at eight. I’d ask you to dine with me at\r\nthe Waldorf, but I’m afraid I’d blow the whole hundred at a sitting.”\r\n\r\n“Good-night!” she waved from the head of the stairs.\r\n\r\nHe answered softly:\r\n\r\n“Good-night!”\r\n\r\nIt was not until his footfall died away on the last stairway that she\r\nrealized what had happened. She had all but uttered a foolish cry for\r\nhim to come back and stay a while longer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “YOU’VE BEEN IN A SORT OF A TRANCE.”]\r\n\r\nIn a moment of humiliating revelation it came over her--the meaning\r\nof her lapse into childhood memories--the old, old idea of having met\r\nbefore--her rapt listening to his boyish enthusiasm--she had fallen\r\nin love at first sight!\r\n\r\nIt was absurd. It was insane--but it was true. Instead of bemoaning her\r\nlack of poise and of character, a foolish imp inside her heart kept\r\nsinging--singing all sorts of silly snatches of songs she had heard in\r\nchildhood. She laughed outright at her all but resistless impulse to\r\nkiss him good-night instead of waving to him.\r\n\r\nWhat an absurd ending to an evening devoted to celebrating the\r\nemancipation of woman from the dominion of man! The one humiliating and\r\ndistressing thing about it was that she was not sure of the impression\r\nshe had made on him. Probably nothing serious had been intended on his\r\npart by his request to call again the following evening. He was merely\r\nbent on an accurate analysis of her character for his first article in\r\nBrown’s paper. The thought gave her a moment of pain that was absurd.\r\n\r\nIn spite of her self-reproaches and warnings she undressed and went to\r\nbed humming an old song.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                                TRAPPED\r\n\r\n\r\nELLEN West tossed for an hour in her luxurious bed unable to sleep. The\r\nluxury of this bed was a personal fad which contradicted apparently\r\nthe austerity of her views of life and yet was strictly a development\r\nof her fundamental trait. Self-development was the keynote of her new\r\nphilosophy of life--the development of the individual character to the\r\nfurthermost reach of every power.\r\n\r\nEllen possessed a voluptuous body. Its beauty was beyond question. Her\r\ncapacity to see, hear, feel, taste and sniff the daintiest perfumes of\r\nthe Garden of Life was a power of which she was both proud and jealous.\r\n\r\nLife was a big serious problem.\r\n\r\nBut in the meantime she must _live_ in order to know life’s\r\nmeaning--live to her finger-tips. She was doing it and she meant to\r\ncontinue. There were personal luxuries which added a hundred-fold to\r\nher capacity to feel and realize life. Perfect rest for her body was\r\none of these personal luxuries.\r\n\r\nThe bed on which she slept had cost more than any three pieces of\r\nfurniture in the room. The rails and stanchions were so heavy they\r\nfelt like lead. The lacquered gold on the surface was wrought by the\r\nhand of an artist into quaint, dim pictures of a dreamland mythology.\r\nThis bedstead had been imported from Europe by a dealer in artistic\r\nfurnishings. He claimed that it had been made by hand for an exiled\r\nking, whose love-affairs had caused an international scandal.\r\n\r\nIn half-dreaming, half-waking moments her vivid imagination had\r\npictured the beauty of the woman for whom it had been built and\r\nwondered at the tragedy of her fate since her royal lover’s exile.\r\n\r\nTo-night the magic of this bed had failed to work its spell. Its\r\ncaressing touch, instead of soothing to sleep, fired her imagination to\r\nnew flights of fancy and brighter visions of life.\r\n\r\nShe reviewed each article of her new creed and renewed her oath of\r\nallegiance only to come up smiling against the vital, appealing young\r\nperson who had chatted to her for an hour about his unimportant self\r\nand completely upset her for the night.\r\n\r\nWhat an absurd thing real life was after all! This boy was real--the\r\nreal human bundle of hopes and dreams and fear and contradictions. To\r\nhim the modern feminist movement meant little or nothing. It was merely\r\na current theme about which he could write a keen satire, perhaps, and\r\nadvance himself in his chosen career. It was easy to see that he was\r\nstudying her more as a specimen of the new female than as an individual\r\ngirl whom he might love or hate. With his provincial education it was\r\ncertain that he held the oldest old-fashioned ideas about the girl of\r\nhis dreams and the home he would build--a gilded cage, no doubt, he\r\npictured it--but still a cage.\r\n\r\nThe certainty of this old-fashioned ideal wrought into the inner fiber\r\nof his being angered her for a moment.\r\n\r\n“Bah! what do I care what the young snip thinks!” she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nShe laughed at the earnestness of her anger, tossed the eiderdown\r\ncoverlet and snowy sheets aside and sprang to her feet.\r\n\r\n“It’s no use trying to sleep, anyhow!”\r\n\r\nShe slipped her toes into a dainty pair of slippers, drew a heavy\r\nfleece-lined robe about her form, threw on the electric light and sank\r\ninto an armchair beside her desk.\r\n\r\nShe had a writing-desk in every room of her studio apartment. When the\r\nspirit moved she sat down and wrote. She wrote so many hours a day,\r\nspirit or no spirit, and usually enticed the spirit to come. But it\r\ncame unbidden at times and she always answered the call.\r\n\r\nShe seized a pencil and pad and wrote the heading of an essay which\r\nshe had planned on the “Significance to Man of the New Woman’s Demand\r\nfor a Single Standard of Morals.” The spirit refused to come. Her mind\r\nrefused point-blank to work.\r\n\r\nShe lit a cigarette and smoked in silence. Always back to the new\r\nobsession--the dark, serious face and straight, slender figure of Ralph\r\nManning!\r\n\r\nShe rose in rage, flecked the ashes from her cigarette and paced the\r\nfloor. The cigarette burned out and scorched her finger. With a gesture\r\nof annoyance she threw it into the lacquered ash-tray.\r\n\r\n“Of course, he’ll disapprove cigarettes!”\r\n\r\nShe laughed indignantly.\r\n\r\n“Of course--of course!”\r\n\r\nShe smoked furiously for half an hour, lighting one cigarette after\r\nanother, in sheer defiance of the opinion of any man on earth.\r\n\r\nHow well she knew his moth-eaten line of argument.\r\n\r\n“Somehow I don’t think it nice for a girl to smoke.”\r\n\r\nShe could hear him saying it in the old, half-apologetic way--ten times\r\nmore insulting and infuriating than a straightforward denunciation. And\r\nhow she hated that little word “nice”! Thank God, she had outgrown the\r\ninfantile ambition for such an extinction of character!\r\n\r\n“Why worry over nothing,” she muttered. “I can bend him to my will if I\r\nwish----.” She paused and puffed a ring of cigarette smoke toward the\r\nceiling.\r\n\r\n“Could I bend him?” she breathed.\r\n\r\nSomething of the ring of steel she had caught once in the fiber of his\r\ncharacter when she had said something that squarely conflicted with his\r\nideals.\r\n\r\n“Would I care anything for him,” she whispered, “if I could bend him as\r\nI willed?”\r\n\r\nShe tried to face the question squarely in her woman’s soul and deep\r\ndown found the old ideal of the glorification of strength at the\r\nbasis of her consciousness of life. She could not imagine herself\r\nin love with a weather-vane. She could not imagine herself in love\r\nwith a weakling, physical or mental. She shuddered at the thought of\r\nsurrendering herself to a weakling.\r\n\r\n“There!” she cried, “I’ve caught myself redhanded mumbling the old\r\ncreed. Surrender, indeed! I’ll not ‘surrender’ to any man on this\r\nearth, strong or weak, genius or fool.”\r\n\r\nShe closed her fine, strong jaw with a snap that meant business.\r\n\r\nIt angered her to think that for an instant she had even breathed the\r\nword “surrender.” For modern woman the word no longer existed. It had\r\nbeen stricken from human speech.\r\n\r\nFrom her self-analysis one fact emerged clearly--she did not propose to\r\nsurrender herself to any man and yet she was positive that she would\r\nhave no respect for the man who would surrender to her.\r\n\r\nShe faced the situation from every point of view and the longer she\r\nlooked at it, the more acute became the sense of possible tragedy in\r\nher love for this boy.\r\n\r\nThe trouble was that he was no mere boy.\r\n\r\nHe was exactly twenty-seven years old. There were but five days\r\ndifference in their ages. They were born in the same month, in the\r\nsame year, under the same star. She had recognized the fine quality of\r\nhis mind and the conquering, enthusiastic yet modest quality of his\r\npersonality. She knew that he would never go backward. She knew that\r\nhe would not stay long in the little room on the square. Such men were\r\nborn to rise. It was written in the book of life.\r\n\r\nThe one thought that haunted her imagination and became a sickening\r\nfear was that she had been stricken with a foolish, unreasonable love\r\nfor a man who would not care for her. In nothing that he had said,\r\nin nothing that he had done, in neither gesture nor tones of speech\r\nnor quiver of eyelid or lip had he revealed the slightest personal\r\ninterest. And yet she had somehow leaped to the absurd conclusion that\r\nhis drawing toward her had been equally as strong as hers toward him.\r\n\r\nShe made up her mind to one thing quickly. She would set herself right\r\non the marriage question when he called in the evening. She would\r\nexpress herself plainly. She would not mince words. She meant to shock\r\nhim and send him about his business at once if he began to show signs\r\nof the usual masculine domineering love-making. It would be best for\r\nall concerned that she strangle the impulse to love in the moment of\r\nits birth rather than face the tragedy of quarrel and disagreement when\r\ntoo late.\r\n\r\nThe decision soothed her mind. She went to bed and slept five hours.\r\nShe woke with a sense of freedom and elation in startling contrast to\r\nthe foreboding of the hours before sleep. Her mind was fresh and every\r\nnerve a quiver with the joy of living. All sense of fear had vanished\r\nand only the prospect of an early meeting with the tall young person\r\nseemed to count.\r\n\r\nShe dressed with a langorous indifference to the call of work.\r\n\r\n“I’ll rest a day anyhow,” she murmured before her mirror.\r\n\r\nShe was sorry she had worn the splendid gown at their first meeting. It\r\nwould be bad form to repeat that effective costume this evening. She\r\nhad intended to buy a new dress weeks ago, but neglected it in the rush\r\nof work. She would take the day off and get it.\r\n\r\nIt was three o’clock in the afternoon before she awakened to the\r\nridiculous fact that she had wasted a day in an idiotic search for a\r\ndress which she didn’t need.\r\n\r\n“What a return to primitive woman!” she exclaimed in disgust.\r\n\r\nShe left the store with a quick, firm decision and walked down Fifth\r\nAvenue to her apartment. In spite of her serious arraignment of her\r\nfeminine weakness she was foolishly happy. She could not help wondering\r\nhow many of the pretty girls she saw looking in the shop windows were\r\nin love.\r\n\r\nTo think that she, Ellen West, orator, author and leader of modern\r\nwoman should fall in love with a callow country youth at first sight!\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, however, he was not “callow.”\r\n\r\nThe word didn’t fit him. He was serious. He had brains. He had a\r\ntrained mind in a trained body and he was master of both.\r\n\r\nYesterday she would have ridiculed the idea of love at first sight\r\nas a physical and psychological impossibility. She would never have\r\nacknowledged that such a thing could really happen to her if she were\r\nnot so unreasonably elated over the disturbing and idiotic fact.\r\n\r\nShe mounted the four flights of stairs in a state of ecstasy, which\r\ngave wings to her feet.\r\n\r\nShe called her maid in tones of gaiety.\r\n\r\n“Lay out my black jet evening gown, Dora!”\r\n\r\n“You gwine out agin dis evenin’, Miss Ellen?”\r\n\r\n“No, silly,” she laughed; “I’m going to stay in----”\r\n\r\nShe paused, leaned near the good-natured ebony face and whispered:\r\n\r\n“Ma beau’s comin’ ter see me, chile!”\r\n\r\n“Ah, g’long, Miss Ellen,” the maid giggled; “you done scared ’em all\r\nter death! I done lose heart. I don’t believe you’s ever gwine ter get\r\nmarried nohow.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve told you I wouldn’t.”\r\n\r\n“Den what yer mean by a beau? Beau means business down South.”\r\n\r\n“So do I, chile!” Ellen cried in mocking tones. “He’s a real sho’ nuff,\r\nhonest-ter-God beau, I tell ye!”\r\n\r\nDora laughed heartily at her mistress’s fine imitation of her dialect.\r\n\r\n“Den de Lawd hab mercy on his po’ soul when you gets froo playin’ wid\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“Maybe it’ll be my po’ soul this time,” she broke in seriously.\r\n\r\n“Well, I recken not!” Dora protested.\r\n\r\n“You never can tell, Dora; you never can tell.”\r\n\r\nShe dressed with unusual care and lazy deliberation. For the first time\r\nin her life the art of dressing her beautiful body became a curiously\r\nsacred thing. She felt the strange elation which swept her heart in\r\nher first emotional experiences in the religion of her childhood. She\r\nwondered what subtle connection there could be between the impulse of\r\nlove and the religious instinct.\r\n\r\nShe surveyed her superb figure before the mirror at last with a\r\nsense of triumph. The black, clinging, filmy material had completely\r\ntransformed her from the shimmering silver vision of the night before.\r\n\r\nAs she studied the effects of the gleaming ivory of her perfect arms\r\nagainst the somber background of the dress she knew instinctively that\r\nhe would like her better in it.\r\n\r\nShe was not surprised at his open-eyed admiration when he entered half\r\nan hour later.\r\n\r\n“You’ll pardon me one perfectly silly boyish speech, won’t you?” he\r\nasked, smiling.\r\n\r\n“Certainly, as many as you like.”\r\n\r\n“I hardly knew you. The effect of that wonderful black dress is really\r\nmagic.”\r\n\r\n“You like it?” she asked with the pride of a school-girl.\r\n\r\n“It’s enchanting. It transforms your whole being. Its tragic, somber\r\nnote awes me. I’m afraid to speak to you, unless you reassure me.”\r\n\r\nShe lifted her finger in warning and studied him intently.\r\n\r\nWas he in earnest? Or was he simply clever in his study of her\r\ncharacter that his analysis might be more searching in his article. She\r\nwondered. At least she would be on her guard.\r\n\r\nBut something about his manner and his frank, engaging ways disarmed\r\nher. In five minutes she was chattering like a school-girl on her first\r\nvacation and he was delivering an endless string of confessions as if\r\nhis life depended on her knowing it all at one sitting.\r\n\r\nOnly once did she remember her determination to make a complete\r\ndeclaration of her independence of man. It seemed too absurd to attempt\r\nto shock this charming, fresh young fellow with her propaganda to-night.\r\n\r\nBesides, the more she thought of it, the more foolish such a proceeding\r\nwould be. He might not really have the slightest personal interest\r\nin her. He, too, was bent on self-development. His ambitions were\r\nboundless. His career was the one big thing in the world. All this\r\nchatter of his might be sheer egotism. Come to think of it, could there\r\nbe any other rational explanation of his eager attentions? She was a\r\nnotable figure in New York life. To call on her was an honor for an\r\nunknown youth. She was taking it all too seriously.\r\n\r\nShe pulled herself up with a sharp jolt and told him it was time to go.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it was time to go. It was ten minutes past twelve o’clock!\r\nIncredible! She looked at the clock a second time, unable to believe\r\nher eyes. She had thought to call the time to go as a rebuke to his\r\npresumption. It was, in fact, a confession of her complete surrender to\r\nhis charm.\r\n\r\nHe rose, blushed and looked hurt. He, too, glanced at the clock.\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon,” he apologized, “for keeping you so late with my\r\nchatter. I had no idea what time it was. I forgot that you have serious\r\nwork to do to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nShe held his hand unconsciously for a moment at the door and caught\r\nherself with a start. Again the utterly silly impulse came to kiss him\r\ngood-night. She closed the door suddenly, shocked with the fear that\r\nshe might do the fool thing on a resistless impulse.\r\n\r\nShe closed the door so quickly the young man’s heart sank with the sure\r\nconviction that he had bored her beyond the hope of forgiveness.\r\n\r\nShe turned back into the room, shocked by the clear recognition of the\r\nfact that she was firmly caught in the trap--the old, old trap which\r\nnature sets for all the mothers of men!\r\n\r\nIt gripped her with a sense of strange foreboding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                              THE LOVERS\r\n\r\n\r\nELLEN’S determination to take a day off from her work to enjoy the\r\nnovelty of the new sensation of love at first sight proved a dangerous\r\nprecedent.\r\n\r\nThe morning after Manning’s visit her mind refused to budge. She\r\nresolutely sat down at her desk, laid out her notes, sharpened three\r\npencils and wrote the title to her article. Nothing followed. That is\r\nto say nothing that had any value for the columns of _The New Era\r\nMagazine_. What actually followed was the endless scribbling of\r\nManning’s name. She wrote it in a smooth, flowing girlish hand as if\r\naddressing imaginary envelopes. She printed it out in pencilled type\r\nin secret correspondence. She wrote it with all sorts of prefixes--Mr.\r\nRalph Manning, the Hon. Ralph Manning. She lingered over this one for\r\nquite a while and wondered if she would like him to enter politics.\r\nHis Southern training gave him a leaning to political life. He was an\r\norator. She had caught this from his modest account of the winning of\r\nthe little gold oratory medal that dangled from his watch chain. He was\r\na Democrat, too,--all Southern boys who came to New York were--except\r\na few from the mountains. This would be an enormous advantage. New\r\nYork City was overwhelmingly Democratic. His culture and genius for\r\nleadership would land him at the top. He might become the Governor.\r\n\r\nShe laughed at her silly enthusiasm, and the laugh died slowly into a\r\nfrown.\r\n\r\n“No! That wouldn’t do at all!” she muttered.\r\n\r\n“A politician is a slave to convention. He dare not call his soul his\r\nown--no, decidedly not!”\r\n\r\nShe sprang to her feet with a gesture of disgust, threw down her pencil\r\nand sought a book to stimulate her mind to creative work again. Every\r\nbook that stared at her from the shelves of her well-chosen library\r\nprovoked an argument with Manning. They were all radical pleas for\r\nthe new world in which she moved. The old-fashioned protests she had\r\nthrown away as fast as she read them. Her faith in woman had become a\r\nreligion. In the fervor of her devotion she refused to harbor heresies.\r\nAny man or woman who opposed the emancipation of woman was a heretic,\r\nand their ravings in print or from the public platform were not only\r\ninsults to the truth--they were crimes. She had made it a rule never to\r\npoison her soul with their venomous attacks.\r\n\r\nEvery title she read was an indictment of Manning’s old-fashioned\r\ncreed. Somehow this morning she resented her own radical\r\nnarrow-mindedness. There were two sides to every question, of course.\r\nShe must give him credit for sincerity in his views.\r\n\r\n“Heavens, what are his views?” she breathed suddenly.\r\n\r\nFor the life of her she couldn’t recall a single sentence of antagonism\r\nto her feminist philosophy. Why had she taken it for granted that he\r\nwould oppose her?\r\n\r\nThe question startled.\r\n\r\nShe repeated it with fearless searching. There could be no doubt to\r\nthe answer if she were honest enough to confess it. She was honest.\r\nShe would confess it. The revelation had come from the depths of her\r\nwoman’s intuitions--her instinctive perception of the mind and purpose\r\nof her mate.\r\n\r\nThe thought infuriated her. Why, in Heaven’s name, should she\r\ninstinctively long for and deliberately plan to win a man who was the\r\ncontradiction in creed, training, and character of everything she stood\r\nfor in life?\r\n\r\nWas it merely the old trick of nature bringing into union two people\r\nwho were opposites? Or was her heart-surrender at sight to this\r\nmere man a proof of the futility of her philosophy of the economic,\r\nspiritual and physical independence of woman?\r\n\r\nShe rejected with scorn the idea of such proof. She determined to put\r\nthe powers of her own personality to the test. She wanted this man.\r\nShe would win him. She would beat down all opposition--no matter what\r\nthe source. She would overwhelm his masculine mind with the obsession\r\nof her love. She would bring him a suppliant to her feet. She would\r\nhesitate at nothing to accomplish this complete triumph.\r\n\r\nWith him the old-fashioned way was the way to win. Of course, he would\r\nbe shocked and hopelessly frightened at any other way.\r\n\r\nShe determined to drop serious literary work for a month. Fortunately,\r\nshe had more than a month’s work ready for the press. Her tremendous\r\nenergies had far outrun the requirements of the magazine for the past\r\nyear. Much of her surplus writing had been seized by the popular\r\nmagazines. They had paid the top prices and she was particularly proud\r\nof this achievement; made, not because she had curried favor with the\r\nmob, but precisely because she had defied their opinions and trampled\r\ntheir most sacred traditions.\r\n\r\nShe would merely drop this extra work and fill her columns in _The\r\nNew Era_. This would give her a month of absolute freedom--freedom\r\nto live to her finger tips--freedom to explore the soul of a man and\r\nfind its inmost secrets.\r\n\r\nShe devoted the day to the careful planning of the long weeks of\r\nvoluptuous idleness she would spend basking in the presence of her\r\nchosen victim. That he would fall before the assault she would make\r\nwas not to be doubted. He had given too many signs of human weakness\r\nthe night before. There was the barest hesitation when confronted\r\nby her creed of independence. The deliberate plan to devote a month\r\nof precious time to the old-fashioned task of ensnaring a man was\r\nundignified in a new woman, to say the least.\r\n\r\nBut the end justified the means. The test--the final moral and\r\nspiritual test of her action--lay in its purpose. If she planned to\r\nforce the burden of her keep on the unsuspecting victim it was immoral\r\nby all the standards of the new ethics. If her purpose was purely one\r\nof self-development, with no intention of either selling herself into\r\nslavery or forcing him into slavery, her conscience would be clear.\r\n\r\nHer conscience was clear. She was following a beautiful and natural\r\nimpulse--the impulse of a hungry heart in search of its mate. She would\r\nlive this glorious hour to its last moment of joy.\r\n\r\nShe threw every scruple to the winds and gave herself to the task\r\nof winning the man she had chosen. No art of the dressmaker, the\r\nshoemaker, the milliner, the hairdresser was neglected.\r\n\r\nAt her suggestion he formed the habit of consulting her daily about\r\nhis work. Her experience of five years in writing for the metropolitan\r\njournals made her advice invaluable. He was quick to recognize this and\r\ngrateful for the honor of her assistance. These regular daily visits\r\nwere made in the early morning and usually lasted but an hour--an hour\r\nof real work for two artistic minds.\r\n\r\nHis first article had been printed in full and featured with\r\nillustrations for the Sunday edition. It had made a sensation both\r\namong the radical leaders of the feminist movement and among the big\r\nnewspaper men as well. It had been written with the true genius of the\r\nborn reporter of events. A philosophy of life ran through its witty\r\nsentences, but the play of humor took the sting from his personal\r\nopinions and made both sides to the controversy laugh.\r\n\r\nHis ambition now was to win a permanent place on the staff of the\r\npaper, with a good annual salary attached, to a chance to move up as he\r\nshould prove his worth.\r\n\r\nTheir morning conference over, he devoted the day to the hardest kind\r\nof work and gave each evening to Ellen West. He was not an observant\r\nman about a woman’s dress. He knew nothing of materials or the art of\r\ntheir making. He was very sensitive to their effects.\r\n\r\nA joyous week had passed before he noticed the extraordinary care with\r\nwhich Ellen was dressing. It never occurred to him that he had caused\r\nit. To his mind it was merely the proof of her perfection as a woman.\r\nHe was particularly pleased because it was proof positive that beneath\r\nall her talk of woman’s declaration of independence was the soul of a\r\nbeautiful and sensitive girl hungry for love. However deep might be\r\nher convictions of women’s right to everything man might have fenced\r\noff and claimed as his own, he thanked God that she was not one of the\r\nfeminine fools bent on making a man of herself.\r\n\r\nNow that he had noticed the perfection of her dress and the exquisite\r\ncharm with which her whole being seemed doubly charged because of it,\r\nhe began to take courage. Drawn to her irresistibly from the moment\r\nof introduction, he had at first regarded her as a sort of goddess\r\ndestined to dwell in the clouds above his head. For the first days\r\nof their intimacy he had not dared to think of her as a possible\r\nsweetheart. He had drifted in the resistless current which her interest\r\nin him had created, content if she smiled.\r\n\r\nThe new light of purpose began to grow in his gaze. She was quick to\r\nnote it and quick to respond to its challenge.\r\n\r\nShe looked into his honest eyes with daring frankness. At first he\r\nhad lowered his own as if afraid he had gone too far in some word or\r\ngesture. He began to return her deep penetrating gaze with a daring\r\nthat made her lower her eyes in spite of her philosophy of independence.\r\n\r\nAt the end of four magic weeks he rapped the brass knocker on her door\r\none morning with unusual violence. The maid was slow answering the\r\ncall. He rapped again with greater violence.\r\n\r\nHe heard Ellen’s voice in sleepy tones:\r\n\r\n“Don’t break it down, please, dear boy; Dora’s on a vacation!”\r\n\r\nHe heard her hand fumbling at the chain bolt and spoke as if for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n“I just can’t wait, Ellen!”\r\n\r\nHe put his hand over his mouth. He wondered if she had heard his daring\r\nfamiliarity.\r\n\r\nThe door suddenly opened and she stepped back to allow him to enter. To\r\nhis amazement she was dressed in a pale pink negligee, her expressive\r\neyes drooping still with the languor of sleep.\r\n\r\nNever had her tall figure seemed so lissom, the lines of her body so\r\nclear and strong and the touch of her footstep so light.\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon,” he stammered, “for coming at this unearthly hour.”\r\n\r\n“Come in,” she said softly.\r\n\r\n“But I just had to see you and tell you first,” he rushed on, unmindful\r\nof her invitation.\r\n\r\n“Come in!” she commanded.\r\n\r\nHe blushed, and went on excitedly.\r\n\r\n“I can’t--I’ve just a minute to tell you that the big thing’s happened.”\r\n\r\n“You’ve won your position?”\r\n\r\n“Landed on both feet--the boss just called me in and told me my salary\r\nwas fifty dollars a week and the job mine as long as I liked it.”\r\n\r\n“They’ll give you more than that,” she smiled.\r\n\r\n“You can bet they will; but the thing is that I’ve landed! I’m part now\r\nof the machine whose throb stirs the world.”\r\n\r\nShe caught the contagion of his enthusiasm and flushed with responsive\r\njoy as she extended her bare arm from the folds of the disturbing pink\r\nrobe.\r\n\r\n“I congratulate you.”\r\n\r\n“I owe so much of it to you,” he cried.\r\n\r\n“Nonsense; you deserve much more and it will come.”\r\n\r\nHe pressed her hand with unusual firmness.\r\n\r\n“I must hurry to the office now; may I come a little earlier than usual\r\nto-night?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly. I’m dying to know all about it.”\r\n\r\nHe pressed her hand again and bounded down the stairs.\r\n\r\nEllen closed the door, slowly walked back into her bedroom and looked\r\ninto the mirror, her arms high above her shoulders in a lazy effort to\r\nreadjust the mass of waving brown hair about to fall. She had hastily\r\nthrown it into an immense coil and fixed it with two pins before\r\nopening the door.\r\n\r\nShe smiled at the charming reflection in the mirror.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid I frightened the poor boy!” she murmured.\r\n\r\nShe lifted her figure with a slow graceful movement, conscious to her\r\nfinger-tips of her power to charm the eye of man and lure his senses\r\ninto submission to her will.\r\n\r\nHer white teeth glowed in the dim light and her mirror flashed back the\r\ntriumphant smile. The crisis had come. She knew it instinctively from\r\nthe moment he had made his announcement. He had an income of $2,500 a\r\nyear and the certainty of an increase in due season. He could marry on\r\nthat. She read him as an open book. He rushed to tell her first because\r\nhe had told her of his hopes and dreams. But the thing that gave spring\r\nto his step and brought him to her door at the unearthly hour of his\r\ncall, the thing that pounded the knocker on her door until it rang like\r\nan alarm of fire, was the possibility of telling her of his love in\r\nthe good old-fashioned way.\r\n\r\nIf there had been any doubt of this in the tone of his voice, the haste\r\nof his call or the process of her analysis of his mind, there could be\r\nno doubt about it after the last look he gave her before hurrying away.\r\nThere was no mistaking that look.\r\n\r\nNow that the crisis in their lives had come it was a pretty serious\r\naffair. Sure as she felt of her powers over his physical senses, there\r\nwas the steel fiber in his character to be reckoned with.\r\n\r\nHe would ask her to marry him. He would do this to-night. She felt it\r\nwith increasing dread and yet she wished it with increasing intensity.\r\n\r\n“What a fool a woman is after all!” she exclaimed. “We _haven’t_\r\nevolved a soul of our own--God knows it’s true!”\r\n\r\nNot for a moment had she weakened on the fundamental test of her creed.\r\nShe couldn’t figure out how he would take it when she refused to marry\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe would beg and plead and cajole and repeat himself, of course. Men\r\nalways had done this--they always would. But would he take refusal as\r\nfinal and quit?\r\n\r\nThe thought was sickening. For the first time she began to dimly\r\nrealize the tragic possibilities of the situation into which she had\r\nallowed herself to drift.\r\n\r\nThe one thing that was now clear beyond the shadow of all doubt was\r\nthat she was hopelessly in love. The passion that held her was the\r\nfirst great emotion she had ever experienced. It was sweeping all life\r\nbefore it.\r\n\r\nShe set her mouth firmly.\r\n\r\n“In the lexicon of youth which fate reserves for a bright manhood\r\nthere’s no such word as fail!”\r\n\r\nShe took the pile of waving brown hair until it fell a mantle of\r\ntenderness about her finely rounded shoulders.\r\n\r\n“Well, Mr. Armand Richelieu, I’m going to show your spirit that in the\r\nlexicon of youth which fate reserved for a bright womanhood there’s no\r\nsuch word as fail!”\r\n\r\nShe spent the day in lazy, joyous brooding over the coming evening. She\r\namused herself picturing his possible attitudes when he came to the\r\ncrucial moment of his declaration and the proposal which she knew would\r\nfollow in the same breath.\r\n\r\nHe wouldn’t fall on his knees--that was certain. There was a deep vein\r\nof the romantic in his nature--and, confound it all--she admired him\r\nfor it in spite of her ridicule of chivalry! But he was also endowed\r\nwith a reasonable amount of common sense. She relied on this to save\r\nhim in the end.\r\n\r\nThe day was warm, but not sultry--a typical, bright July day in\r\nNew York, with cooling breezes sweeping the city from the sea. She\r\nplanned the evening carefully and selected the exact spot for the big\r\nlove-scene. It should be on the roof, with the stars looking down, and\r\nthe soft splash of the tiny fountain for a musical accompaniment.\r\n\r\nAgain she wondered just what he would say--and again the foolish fear\r\ngripped her that she might lose him in the maze of her new theories of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                             THE PROPOSAL\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE hour for his coming approached. She had planned the scene of his\r\ndeclaration carefully and yet the fear of a tragic outcome steadily\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nThe more clearly she reasoned out her theories of marriage, the more\r\ndangerous they became in the present crisis. Why couldn’t she have\r\nfallen in love with one of the brilliant men in her circle of friends\r\nand admirers who had accepted as a matter of course her new creed of\r\nlife? Why did nature persist in drawing together two people who are\r\nopposites? Another evidence of the blind stupidity of nature and the\r\nneed of human genius to circumvent her clumsy methods.\r\n\r\nCould she compromise her ideal of love and life to win a lover? To the\r\nold-fashioned girl the asking of the question was the answer. Such a\r\nproblem could not exist. All things on earth, beneath or above, for her\r\nwere merged into the one supreme purpose of winning a lover.\r\n\r\nCould she, the new woman, yield to win this man? The answer did\r\nnot come as quickly as she wished. She reproached herself for the\r\nhesitation. She faced the question of a break with Manning, and the\r\nworld was a blank, her economic independence a mockery. Why have the\r\nmeans to live if the one thing that makes life worth the candle should\r\nbe taken away?\r\n\r\nIt shouldn’t be taken away! On that point she set herself with\r\ndetermination. She would hold her ideals and hold her man, too. If it\r\nhadn’t been done yet by a woman it was time the example was set.\r\n\r\nShe sat down at her desk and made an outline of the old arguments he\r\nwould advance to have his way. She carefully matched each argument with\r\nan invincible answer. He would see the logic of her position. He must\r\nsee it. He had a brilliant and well-balanced mind.\r\n\r\nShe paused in her train of thought. That was just it! He did have a\r\nbrilliant mind. At times it flashed a steel polish that defied the\r\nappeal of sentiment. She hated him for this masculine way of final\r\nassertion. And yet she loved him for it. What a fool contradiction!\r\n\r\nCertainly he must listen to her. He had profound respect for her\r\ntalents and achievements.\r\n\r\nShe threw fears to the winds and gave herself up to the joy of his\r\ncoming. She began to listen for his firm footstep on the stairs. She\r\ncould tell the sound of it on the first flight if she stood at her\r\ndoor. There was something electric in its touch--a spring to his tall,\r\nstrong young body that seemed to give it wings.\r\n\r\nShe looked at her watch. He was five minutes late. Her brow clouded. If\r\nsome accident had happened! It was preposterous. And yet it would be\r\njust like blind fool nature to make such a tragic blunder.\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!” she laughed.\r\n\r\nOf course, an accident was absurd. She laughed again at her school girl\r\nsilliness. It was far more likely that he was giving an extra touch to\r\nhis dress to-night with the assurance of a reputable income.\r\n\r\nThe real reason of his delay never occurred to her for a moment.\r\n\r\nShe opened her door and listened for the first sound of his footfall.\r\nTen minutes passed and still she leaned over the top rail in vain. At\r\nlast he came leaping with a swift spring, two steps at a time.\r\n\r\nHer first impulse was to run inside, shut the door and pretend to be\r\nbusy. She checked herself in time to save self-respect. She loathed\r\nthese primitive instincts of her sex!\r\n\r\nShe braced herself for his coming with calm assurance. He cleared the\r\nlast step with a bound and barely checked himself in time to prevent a\r\ncollision.\r\n\r\nThere was no reproach in her deep eyes. Only the frank joy of his\r\ncoming. He was profuse with apologies.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry to be late to-night of all nights. I meant to come earlier\r\nthan usual. But it couldn’t be helped. I’ll tell you why directly----”\r\n\r\nShe smiled at his breathless earnestness.\r\n\r\n“Come on the roof--it’s too close inside,” she said quietly.\r\n\r\nHe followed her in silence and took his seat beside her.\r\n\r\nShe displayed no curiosity to know the reason of his delay and let him\r\nfinish his apologies without a word of acceptance or protest.\r\n\r\nHe caught her mood at last and looked at her tenderly.\r\n\r\n“I’m glad you’re wearing that black dress to-night.”\r\n\r\n“You like it?”\r\n\r\n“You’re wonderful in it. I love its suggestion of tragic things. How\r\nbeautiful you are!”\r\n\r\nHer heart stopped for an instant, as his eyes held hers in a steady\r\ngaze.\r\n\r\nIt was the first time in all their hours together that he had said a\r\nthing so directly personal. It was sweet to hear it. She smiled an\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nA silence followed. She felt intuitively the storm breaking within his\r\nheart and the answering whirlwind of her own soul. The roar of traffic\r\ndied away on the avenue, the stars studded the arched roof above them,\r\nand the new moon hung a silver crescent on the edge of the tall tower\r\nof the Metropolitan building. The July air was softly langorous and\r\nsuggestive to every sense. She caught the faint odor of the flowers in\r\nthe circle of the tiny fountain and heard the dim music of its falling\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\nFor the moment she was all spirit. Her soul seemed to slowly dissolve\r\ninto space until she felt the joy of perfect union with all life. A\r\ncricket chirped in the privet bushes beside the chimney and waked her\r\nfrom the strange dream.\r\n\r\nHe was still gazing at her in silence. His eyes in the soft radiance of\r\nthe stars had the look of ravenous hunger.\r\n\r\nTo her surprise he rose, suddenly drew her to her feet and without a\r\nword swept her to his heart and kissed her lips. The shock was too\r\ngreat for protest or response. She felt her muscles relax in his arms\r\nand caught herself. He drew her closer and kissed her again.\r\n\r\n“You know that I love you, Ellen,” he whispered.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“It’s wonderful, isn’t it, my beautiful love-woman?”\r\n\r\n“Wonderful,” she breathed.\r\n\r\n“I thought I’d lived before. I was only born the day I met you.”\r\n\r\nHis arm circled her waist and she wondered what mysterious power had\r\nsuddenly struck her dumb. She had worked out beautiful speeches to make\r\nto him. They were forgotten in the storm of emotion sweeping her from\r\nthe shores of time into eternity.\r\n\r\n“My love-woman!” he murmured.\r\n\r\n“My love-man!” she softly answered.\r\n\r\nThis time she drew him close, impulsively threw both arms around his\r\nneck and kissed him.\r\n\r\n“Well, if that’s what your new creed teaches you,” he laughed, “go as\r\nfar as you like!”\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with tender reproach.\r\n\r\n“It took me a little while to get my breath,” she explained. “Your\r\nwhirlwind methods swept me off my feet.”\r\n\r\n“No apologies necessary, I assure you. Just make up for lost time.\r\nThat’s the most wonderful thing that ever happened to me on this\r\nearth--do it again!”\r\n\r\nHer bare arms flashed about his neck and her lips found his in another\r\nkiss.\r\n\r\nHe laughed in boyish glee.\r\n\r\n“Well, they can all have their little fluffy ingenue girls, if they\r\nlike. For me, the new woman, the queen of life--my radiant, tragically\r\nbeautiful love-woman! I can’t believe my eyes when I look at you\r\nto-night and think that you’re mine--all mine, body and soul, mine for\r\ntime and eternity.”\r\n\r\nHe stopped suddenly and led her back to the settee.\r\n\r\n“Sit down a minute,” he said, “and I’ll tell you why I was late.”\r\n\r\nHe was fumbling in his vest pocket. Before she realized what he was\r\ndoing, he drew from its depths a tiny purple box and touched the lid.\r\nOn the white velvet cushion sat a wonderful ring with two diamonds.\r\nTheir lustre was dazzling and from their size she knew they could not\r\nbe worth less than two thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nShe gasped in astonishment.\r\n\r\n“For a poor young man,” she cried, “you do pretty well for a first\r\nvisit to the jeweller.”\r\n\r\n“Do you like it?” he asked proudly.\r\n\r\n“I adore it!”\r\n\r\nThe love of jewelry was a passion she had long regarded as her\r\nbesetting sin. She had religiously suppressed her desire to indulge it.\r\nHer fingers touched the sparkling stones.\r\n\r\n“How did you do it?”\r\n\r\n“That’s why I was late,” he answered eagerly. “My mother left me her\r\nearrings in her will. It was all she had from the wreck of the Civil\r\nWar. I kept them sacredly for the woman of my dreams. I had them set\r\nfor you. The jeweller was a little late finishing the ring. I couldn’t\r\ncome without it.”\r\n\r\nHe drew it from the box, slipped it on her finger, bent and kissed it.\r\n\r\nShe flashed it in the starlight.\r\n\r\n“Isn’t it beautiful?” she cried.\r\n\r\n“Not half so beautiful as the light of your eyes,” he whispered. “How\r\nsoon will you marry me?”\r\n\r\nShe continued to look at the ring as if enchanted.\r\n\r\n“Let’s marry right away,” he pleaded.\r\n\r\nShe held the ring up in the reflected light from the windows of the big\r\nbuilding opposite and studied it.\r\n\r\n“To-morrow night would suit me,” he sighed.\r\n\r\nStill no answer.\r\n\r\n“All right,” he said softly, “you name the day.”\r\n\r\nIt was no use postponing the inevitable. It had to come. They must\r\nfight it out here and now. She faced it resolutely.\r\n\r\n“I can’t marry you, my love-man,” she replied seriously.\r\n\r\nHe took her hand to draw her into his arms and hush her silly talk with\r\nkisses, but caught the look of tragedy in her drawn expression and\r\nstopped short.\r\n\r\n“Can’t marry me?” he repeated slowly. “Is there another?”\r\n\r\nShe smiled.\r\n\r\n“There is no other man, there never has been, there never will be----”\r\n\r\n“And you love me?”\r\n\r\n“It’s just because I love you.”\r\n\r\n“You won’t marry me because you love me?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t make me laugh,” he cried. “What sort of joke is this you’re\r\ntrying to put up on me?”\r\n\r\n“I was never more serious.”\r\n\r\n“You can’t be!”\r\n\r\n“You have read my book and my essays on marriage?”\r\n\r\n“Sure.”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“What of it? What’s your book on the ‘Modern Woman Movement’ to do with\r\nyour personal life?”\r\n\r\n“My book is my life--the revelation of the best that’s in me.”\r\n\r\nHe threw up both hands in a gesture of impatience.\r\n\r\n“Not at all. Your book is the propaganda of a new religion. You are its\r\nhigh priestess. You’re preaching the faith.”\r\n\r\n“But I mean it.”\r\n\r\nHe laughed lightly.\r\n\r\n“My father was a clergyman. Your writing on that subject gives me\r\nexactly the impression which his sermons used to make on me. I\r\nscandalized the entire family one day at a dinner. My father had just\r\nthrilled the assembled guests with a story of personal experience. I\r\nlooked at him a moment in open-eyed wonder and quietly asked:\r\n\r\n“‘Is that _so_, papa, or are you just preachin’?’ The people\r\nlaughed and my mother sent me to bed. Your theories about marriage are\r\nall very well for the consumption of radical thinkers. But for you to\r\napply such things to your life to-day--nonsense--it’s unthinkable--you,\r\nmy love--my life--my beautiful goddess!”\r\n\r\n“That’s it. I refuse to be a goddess. I’m going to be just a human\r\nbeing. Every human being should have an equal right to develop and\r\nexercise his or her capacities. My life is an end in itself. I have\r\nonly this one to live. I must live it as completely as possible. A\r\nwoman has the right to her own soul. I wish to see life with my own\r\neyes, not through the eyes of a husband. I will not be a mere female.\r\nI insist on having a soul. I refuse to be the mere matter on which the\r\nwill of man acts and reacts. Marriage reduces woman to this. Marriage\r\nis the death of personality for women. Marriage is the death of love\r\nfor most women. I demand and I will have the poetry of love--or I will\r\nhave nothing. I loathe the kept woman--wife or mistress. I refuse to\r\nuse my sex for economic purposes. Marriage is a trade in which a woman\r\npractises the art of sex allurement to make a living off men. I don’t\r\nhave to stoop to such a trade. I have one----”\r\n\r\nManning broke into another laugh and seized her hand with rough command.\r\n\r\n“Stop this foolishness, my sweetheart. You’re talking from books----”\r\n\r\n“I’m giving you my deepest soul conviction.”\r\n\r\n“You’re quoting a lot of rubbish you’ve read. I’ve read some of it\r\nmyself. Preach it if you wish for future generations to think and dream\r\nabout. When we all go to heaven and sprout wings it may come. But down\r\nhere in this sinful world you’re going to be _mine_--do you hear?”\r\n\r\nHe leaned close and caught the perfume of her breath as her bosom rose\r\nand fell with sudden emotion.\r\n\r\n“I will not be your slave!”\r\n\r\n“But I must protect you, my dear,” he pleaded.\r\n\r\n“Protection means that a man buys love and a woman sells it. I will not\r\ndepend on my sex for a living.”\r\n\r\n“Who asked you? Go on and make as big a salary as you wish. We’ll keep\r\nit for the children,” he interrupted smiling.\r\n\r\n“The economic use of sex,” she went on earnestly, “in wife, mistress\r\nand prostitute is the cancer eating at the heart of society to-day----”\r\n\r\n“Please don’t, dear,” he begged, “you’re quoting from your new books, I\r\ntell you! What has all this to do with you and me? We love one another.\r\nWe’ve got to get married----”\r\n\r\n“That’s exactly why we won’t get married. We will preserve our love\r\nfrom its blight--its dull stupidity, its lack of reserve, its ugly\r\nhours of everlasting boredom. For example, you might snore or I might\r\nsnore. There are a thousand and one petty annoyances which daily\r\ncontact brings to two positive personalities. The moment I realize that\r\nyou are _mine_, I am no longer yours; can’t you see this?”\r\n\r\n“I can not!”\r\n\r\n“Well, I do,” she insisted, “and I’m going to save you from the great\r\ncurse. I assert the right of free thought against the stupid creed of\r\nauthority. I preach and propose to practice the love of my dreams. I\r\nwill have nothing less. I claim the right to serve society with my love\r\naccording to my own choice and the right to use my love in my own way.\r\nThis is best for society, because only thus can I attain the best that\r\nis in me.”\r\n\r\nHe lifted his hand impatiently.\r\n\r\n“You reject my love, then.”\r\n\r\nShe flushed and was silent for a moment studying his sensitive, mobile\r\nface. Never had she seen him quite so handsome as in this crisis of\r\ndeep emotion. Never had she seen him more completely master of himself.\r\nIt was this poise under the stress of the storm that disconcerted her\r\nas she faced the full declaration of her principles and her plan of\r\naction.\r\n\r\nIf he had exploded in protests or lost his head in impetuous pleading\r\nshe might have felt her ground more secure. But he had done nothing of\r\nthe kind. His words had been dropped one by one as if he were summing\r\nup the facts rather than pleading:\r\n\r\n“You--reject--my--love--then----”\r\n\r\nThere was not even an interrogation point at the end of the sentence.\r\nIt was ominous. An iron will slumbered beneath the smiling quiet of his\r\ncharacter. She felt its hard grip on her nerves.\r\n\r\nThe silence lengthened. A moment’s cowardice struck her heart. He was\r\nwaiting her answer, his eyes searching her soul for the deep things of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n“You know that I love you,” she faltered.\r\n\r\n“Then how can you refuse love’s right to its own?”\r\n\r\n“I do not refuse.”\r\n\r\n“You have refused.”\r\n\r\n“No----”\r\n\r\n“You will not marry me.”\r\n\r\n“But I shall love you forever!”\r\n\r\n“And you ask me to cherish my love as an empty dream and never build\r\nthe home that’s in my heart?”\r\n\r\n“Your love shall not be an empty dream.”\r\n\r\n“It will be without you.”\r\n\r\n“I’m going to be with you,” she whispered softly.\r\n\r\n“Then we must build our home.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” she asked earnestly. “This old-fashioned home of which you dream\r\nis the mortal enemy of every woman who aspires to a conscious soul.”\r\n\r\n“You can’t believe such rubbish!” he interrupted.\r\n\r\n“I not only believe it, I know it,” she went on eagerly. “I was born\r\nand reared in one. My father and mother were human beings outside the\r\n‘home.’ The moment they crossed the sacred threshold they each were\r\npossessed of at least seven devils. ‘Home’ was the cave removed from\r\nthe interference of the police in which they could, at their leisure,\r\ntear each other to pieces. And they did it regardless of my feelings.”\r\n\r\n“But such unhappy marriages are the exception.”\r\n\r\n“They are the rule, if the truth were known! The reason we don’t hear\r\nthe noise of battle is that the woman makes no cry. My mother was made\r\nof different stuff from the average. She could endure only so much and\r\nthen she saw red, and when she did the male animal in her way had to\r\npay. The one dream of your heart is a home?”\r\n\r\n“God never made a real man in whose breast it wasn’t planted.”\r\n\r\n“And you never dreamed there might be something nobler, something\r\nfiner, something more beautiful?”\r\n\r\n“Never,” he answered sharply.\r\n\r\n“And yet, you think for a minute,” she argued tenderly. “The dull round\r\nof uninteresting work in the home to which the woman who marries is\r\nsentenced for life is more hopeless and nerve-wracking than the task to\r\nwhich a convict in prison is assigned. This joyless, stupid toil robs\r\nher of individuality, all power of original thought, and strips her of\r\nevery chance of self-expression and development.”\r\n\r\n“Self-development? Great Scott!” he broke in, “doesn’t every woman\r\nexpress herself in her children?”\r\n\r\n“No more than every man. Is man content with such self-development\r\nas he finds in his children? No. Each human being must live his own\r\nlife within or die the living death before the grave. I am a human\r\nbeing, dear man! Let me be human. I will love you with a love that is\r\ndeathless, because humanity is immortal. Why must you condemn me to\r\na life of penal servitude because we love each other? This ‘home’ in\r\nwhich you propose to confine me in shackles will steal the light from\r\nmy eyes, put out the fires of intellect and rob me of every grace and\r\nbeauty which I possess. It will unfit me to maintain myself an equal\r\nwhom you can respect!”\r\n\r\nHe listened intently, his face a mask.\r\n\r\n“I don’t regard you as my equal,” he answered slowly.\r\n\r\nShe stiffened the slightest bit.\r\n\r\n“You couldn’t with your ideals----”\r\n\r\n“You’re not my equal,” he went on evenly. “You are my superior. I know\r\nthis by the deepest intuitive knowledge--the impulse to worship which\r\nsteals into my heart with every thought of you. I refuse to degrade you\r\nwith a cheap masculine equality. I refuse to love my equal. I must love\r\nand worship with the same heart-beat----”\r\n\r\n“But I don’t want to be worshipped!” she cried.\r\n\r\nHe seized her hand with cruel force.\r\n\r\n“I don’t care what you want! I’m going to have my way. I adore you and\r\nI’m going to keep on adoring you! The home is the temple in which I\r\npropose to build the high altar of this religion as old as the beat of\r\nthe human heart--you can’t escape me--you are mine!”\r\n\r\n“I’ll not try to escape you, love-man!” she whispered tensely. “But I\r\nshall not allow you to bind me with chains.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll kiss the chains that bind me to you,” he interrupted.\r\n\r\n“I can’t,” she persisted. “I can’t even wear this ring you have brought\r\nwith so many beautiful thoughts and such sweet and utter sacrifice----”\r\n\r\n“You can’t wear my ring--why?”\r\n\r\nShe drew it slowly from her finger and held it in the soft light.\r\n\r\n“Because it is the symbol of ancient slavery”; she paused and kissed it.\r\n\r\n“I kiss it not in submission, but in joyous freedom as I return it to\r\nmy glorious lover. Love’s freedom for me means the freedom of enduring\r\nlove. It neither asks nor expects sign or symbol.”\r\n\r\nHe leaned close.\r\n\r\n“In heaven’s name, what do you propose to do with me, then?”\r\n\r\nShe flushed, silently slipped the ring back into his reluctant hand,\r\ngripped it in both hers, kissed it passionately and fixed her deep eyes\r\non his.\r\n\r\n“What am I going to do with you?” she slowly repeated: “Love you\r\nalways. Even in all ages and climes women of beauty and genius have\r\ndone what they pleased. I’m going to do what I please; not in wilful\r\ndisobedience to law, but in obedience to the highest within me.\r\nMarriage is not the creation of law--the law is _its_ creation.\r\nEven historically free marriage is the real marriage. The public\r\ncelebration of a wedding is already becoming a vulgar spectacle to the\r\nnew conscience of the world----”\r\n\r\nShe paused and pressed his hand tenderly. She felt him growing cold.\r\nShe felt him slipping away from her and gripped his fingers desperately.\r\n\r\n“Well, go on,” he said gently.\r\n\r\nShe braced herself.\r\n\r\n“When two intelligent human beings wish to be together,” she whispered\r\ngently, “no bond is needed; if they do not wish to be together, why\r\nchain them?”\r\n\r\nHis jaw snapped with firm decision.\r\n\r\n“And you think me dog enough to consent to such a degradation of your\r\nlife?”\r\n\r\n“I hold such love the supreme glory of life!”\r\n\r\n“And yet the man who dared offer such love to my\r\nsister--I--would--kill--him--as--I--would--a--rattlesnake!”\r\n\r\nHe stopped suddenly and drew her head to his breast.\r\n\r\n“Dear sweetheart, forget your madness; I couldn’t let you do this\r\ninsane thing--you know it! I take your offer as the supreme expression\r\nof a great and beautiful love. I’m not worthy of it. I would be still\r\nless worthy if I listened for a moment.”\r\n\r\n“But you _must_ listen, dear love-man!”\r\n\r\n“I will not.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t be your slave.”\r\n\r\n“I beg to be yours!”\r\n\r\n“Then do as I command you.”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Then you’re not my slave?”\r\n\r\n“In my own way.”\r\n\r\n“But I don’t like your way. I dislike the domestic habits of man. They\r\nare intolerable to my self-respect.”\r\n\r\nThe nerve tension broke at last. He laughed, deliberately took her in\r\nhis arms and kissed her passionately.\r\n\r\n“You sweet, adorable bundle of contradictions!” he cried.\r\n\r\n“I can have my own way?” she asked demurely.\r\n\r\n“You can not!” he replied firmly.\r\n\r\n“Then it will never be!”\r\n\r\nHe left her standing at the head of the stairs repeating her decision:\r\n\r\n“Never!”\r\n\r\nHe waved a last good-night, blew her a kiss, and said:\r\n\r\n“Will be back to-morrow to arrange for the ceremony!”\r\n\r\nShe turned into her room with a sickening sense of defeat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                              THE BATTLE\r\n\r\n\r\nELLEN felt her way into the room and sat down in the dim light of the\r\nstreet lamps. She loved this quaint apartment. Five years of strenuous\r\nwork within its walls had given to it the power of restoring tired\r\nnerves and toning the fiber of character. The front half of the floor\r\nspace was devoted to the one large living-room with three windows\r\nopening on Fifth Avenue. The ceiling was unusually high and a gallery\r\nwith white spindles and mahogany rail circled the two sides and rear\r\nend of it. From the balcony in the rear the doors opened into two\r\nbedrooms and beneath them on the level of the living-room was the\r\ndining-room, kitchen, pantry and maid’s room.\r\n\r\nEach piece of furniture was selected with care and expressed some mood\r\nor fancy of her vivid imagination.\r\n\r\nThe walls of the living-room were in brown leather and the furnishings\r\nsuggested the library and sitting-room combined. The walls for the\r\nfirst four feet up were lined with books--every inch of the space taken\r\nwith the cases even at the turn of the corners and beneath each window.\r\n\r\nOn the floor was a rich brown carpet, with an oriental rug here and\r\nthere to break its wide stretches of plainness.\r\n\r\nThe quiet dignity of the room soothed her. She walked to the window\r\nand looked out on the brightly lighted square. The electric hand\r\nof the clock in the tower pointed to eleven. He had gone unusually\r\nearly to-night. By all the laws of love-customs he should have stayed\r\nunusually late.\r\n\r\n“Stubborn mule!” she muttered. “He thinks I’ll give in, of course;\r\nwe’ll see!”\r\n\r\nThe window was up full height and through its wide space came the faint\r\ncall of the cricket in the little privet hedge on the roof above.\r\n\r\nThe cricket’s chirp recalled her tumultuous emotions of the moment when\r\nhe had swept her into his arms and kissed her lips. How long ago it\r\nseemed! She had lived years in the two brief hours. The memory of his\r\nkiss stirred now with a strange maddening thrill.\r\n\r\nSomething new had awakened into being within her body in that first\r\nkiss--something sweet and wonderful in its power to torture. She\r\nrealized it with a sense of joyous awe--the grip of this force on her\r\nlife and character.\r\n\r\nShe was stronger because of it. Of this she was sure. New power to\r\nwill had throbbed within her from the moment of its first call. She\r\nbreathed deeply. The dimly lighted room with its leather walls and row\r\non row of books gave back her cry of personal triumph in the struggle.\r\nThis room was hers. No man could claim or dominate it. Here her\r\nimagination had found its wings and soared in joyous freedom.\r\n\r\n“I’ll keep that freedom too!” she snapped. “The man who enters here\r\nshall come as my comrade and equal--not as my lord and master!”\r\n\r\nStrange that this passionate wilful being which his kisses had stirred\r\ninto life within should turn thus on its creator! And yet it was so.\r\nLife began to take on new meanings. Never had it seemed so sweet--its\r\nmystery so exhaustless. For the first time within memory had the full\r\nimport of sex consciousness dawned. It brought new dignity and strength.\r\n\r\n“My man can not resist me!” she breathed. “I’ll win. I’ll have my way,\r\nnot his.”\r\n\r\nShe mounted the short flight of stairs, threw on the light in her\r\nbedroom and undressed with a lazy consciousness of power--power to\r\nthink, to will, to execute her will. The touch of the luxurious bed\r\nsoothed her vanity. She was mistress of her own life. She had developed\r\nthe strength to fight and win the first battle for the supremacy of\r\npersonality. She would win the next one also.\r\n\r\nShe awoke next morning strong and elated. She caught herself singing\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n“Well, why shouldn’t I sing!” she muttered. “My man I’ve found. He’s\r\nfine and strong. His mind is keen. His will is stubborn. But I like it.\r\nI’ll bend him to mine----”\r\n\r\nShe paused and laughed softly.\r\n\r\n“Away with doubts and fears; I can twist him ’round my little finger\r\nwhen I am ready.”\r\n\r\nShe dressed with unusual care. Her bath was a religious ceremony. Never\r\nhad she been so conscious of beauty or so proud of its power. She would\r\nuse it to bend the man of her choice.\r\n\r\nShe began to write again at nine o’clock. Her mind was clear, every\r\nfaculty alert, her imagination aglow. For two hours her pencil flew\r\nover the clean white sheets of paper. She thoroughly enjoyed work.\r\n\r\nShe paused for a brief rest and thanked God for the gift of expression.\r\nAbove all she thanked Him for the independence of man which it had\r\nbrought her. But for this she could never have resisted the temptation\r\nto accept the support of Manning by trading on her sex. How degrading\r\nthe thought! How could any woman with a soul trade on the mysterious\r\nand beautiful impulse that thrilled her being now with inspiring power?\r\n\r\nShe renewed her vow to lead the revolution for the emancipation of\r\nwomanhood. She vowed anew to demand and secure the vast changes in the\r\nsocial order which this emancipation would mean. The revolution which\r\nshe would lead would summon millions of sleeping souls into vivid\r\nconscious life.\r\n\r\nThe sharp rap on the brass knocker of her door was unmistakable. It was\r\nthe nervous call of Lucy Sheldon bent on some important mission. She\r\nhad heard it before. She heard it now with dread. Of all the friends\r\nshe had made in New York this demure little woman was her most loyal\r\nadviser in every trial. To-day she would resent her advice. She was\r\nthe most provoking of all the opponents of the radical program. She\r\nhad the power to provoke because she had been so successful in her\r\ncareer and yet held to her old-fashioned ideal of the home and home\r\nlife with dogged persistence. She believed in woman’s right to develop\r\nher powers to the highest reach of their capacity, yet held with the\r\ntenacity of fanaticism to the principle that she must develop as woman,\r\nnot as man,--that she is fundamentally different. And that feminism\r\nmust contribute something new to humanity because of this fundamental\r\ndifference. She was an ardent believer in the cause of woman’s suffrage\r\nbecause she believed that the mind of woman should supplement, not\r\nsupplant, the mind of man in solving the problems of state. She\r\nbelieved that the salvation of the world awaits the universal training\r\nof womanhood to rear a nobler race of men.\r\n\r\nEllen knew her arguments by heart and she was sick of them because she\r\nhad found no answer satisfactory to her own inner sense of logic and\r\nright. She knew the line of argument this morning and resented it more\r\nfiercely because its point would be so intensely personal.\r\n\r\nCould Manning have made her his confidant so quickly? She would resent\r\nthat too. Perhaps he had only hinted at the truth. She flushed at the\r\nthought of another woman’s knowledge of the daring proposal she had\r\nmade to her lover. In the next breath she reproached herself for such\r\ninconsistency.\r\n\r\n“Why should I resent my best friend knowing it if I’m going to defy the\r\nworld!” she mused bitterly.\r\n\r\nShe was still busy with her resentful thoughts when the sharp rap was\r\nrepeated with greater violence.\r\n\r\nThe maid was still out of town. She sprang to her feet at last to\r\nanswer the knock. Perhaps her fears were vain after all. It was not\r\nprobable that Manning had gone so far as she feared.\r\n\r\nShe opened the door smiling and Lucy Sheldon entered with merely a\r\nnod. She had always insisted before on the habit of kissing her. It\r\nhad always annoyed Ellen. She had submitted to it under protest. But\r\nher love for the older woman was too deep for little differences of\r\nhabit to seriously jar. This morning she resented the omission of the\r\nkiss with genuine anger. It struck her with the force of a blow. The\r\nhidebound little fool had already assumed the air of superior virtue at\r\nthe bare thought of the proposal to her nephew!\r\n\r\nEllen looked at her in hurt surprise, her hand still on the door.\r\n\r\n“Shut the door!” Lucy commanded sharply.\r\n\r\nEllen closed the door and moved toward the armchair in which her friend\r\nusually seated herself for a chat beside the desk.\r\n\r\nLucy Sheldon’s eyes sought hers with a look of yearning tenderness. A\r\nsmothered cry of pain suddenly broke the silence and she threw herself\r\ninto Ellen’s arms sobbing.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the two friends held each other. The older woman touched\r\nthe flushed young cheek. Her slender fingers trembled with the caress\r\nof a mother.\r\n\r\n“How beautiful you are this morning, my dear!” she faltered.\r\n\r\nHer first words were so unexpected they brought a feeling of uneasy\r\nsurprise. There would be no stormy argument. Her tactics would be more\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\nWithout response she led Lucy to a chair.\r\n\r\n“Sit down now and tell me all about it,” Ellen said briskly.\r\n\r\nThe older woman looked at her through her tears.\r\n\r\n“Oh, how could you, my child! How could you!” she cried.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps I haven’t yet,” Ellen laughed.\r\n\r\n“But you will. I know how stubborn you are--unless I can stop you.”\r\n\r\n“What has he told you?” Ellen asked sharply.\r\n\r\n“Not much. But I know you so well that I put two and two together and\r\nI understood. The poor boy was so distressed, so heart-sick that I\r\ndragged it out of him piece by piece until I got the whole truth.”\r\n\r\n“He’ll come round to my way of thinking.”\r\n\r\n“Never!”\r\n\r\n“He will.”\r\n\r\n“And if he does,” Lucy fiercely declared, “he’ll be no kinsman of mine.\r\nI’d never see him or speak to him again.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense, my dear, I shall assume the full responsibility of my\r\nrevolutionary conduct. A leader must lead. I shall lead in this and he\r\nwill follow.”\r\n\r\n“You will deliberately seduce him into such a crime?”\r\n\r\n“Deliberately.”\r\n\r\n“It’s incredible!”\r\n\r\n“It’s not. You believe that I’ll do it, or you wouldn’t be so\r\ndistressed, you dear old conventional bugbear!”\r\n\r\nLucy’s eyes were blinded with tears.\r\n\r\n“You will dare to live with your lover without a marriage ceremony in\r\ndefiance of law and society?” she asked at last.\r\n\r\n“I will,” was the firm response. “In the desert of this money-grubbing,\r\nsex-trading metropolis, I’ll create an ideal world for two or die in\r\nthe effort.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll die in the effort.”\r\n\r\n“All right, I’ll make it easier for the next.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll make it worse, dear, foolish child of impulse. You’re mad.\r\nYour cry of personal freedom has led you into anarchy pure and\r\nsimple--anarchy and the grossest materialism.”\r\n\r\n“The highest idealism,” Ellen interrupted.\r\n\r\n“Ideal fiddlesticks! You have misread the history of women and the\r\nhistory of the race. Man did not create monogamic marriage----”\r\n\r\n“No, the devil did it!”\r\n\r\nLucy ignored the interruption.\r\n\r\n“Woman created monogamic marriage by the slow, painful process of\r\nthousands of years of struggle with man’s unbridled passions. Man\r\nis normally by sex-instinct a polygamous animal. Out of the bog of\r\nhis promiscuous impulses woman has led him by the tenderness of her\r\ndevotion into the establishment by law of a social order which protects\r\nher in the rearing of her young. You propose to destroy this.”\r\n\r\n“I propose to re-establish it on a higher, nobler plane.”\r\n\r\n“By restoring to man his license to roam the fields again a mere\r\nanimal--a beast.”\r\n\r\n“He roams to-day in spite of bonds!”\r\n\r\n“The law will always be defied by the lawless, while it binds silent\r\nmillions. You’re absolutely crazy, my child! Marry my nephew as he\r\nasks you and he’ll be your loyal mate for life. He will never lift his\r\neyes in lust or love to another woman. I know him. It’s in his blood.\r\nA finer breed of men were never born. The home instinct that God has\r\nplanted in his soul and generations of pious beautiful mothers have\r\ncherished is the finest thing in him. And he never will be happy until\r\nhe realizes it. You may wreck his life, but you will never destroy that\r\ncraving. He will wreck your life through it.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not afraid,” she said defiantly.\r\n\r\n“No. You’re just mad with this obsession of individual freedom.”\r\n\r\nShe paused, leaned closer and continued in low tones:\r\n\r\n“The modern woman doesn’t refuse to marry. She doesn’t get the chance\r\nto marry. This is the cancer that’s eating out the heart of our social\r\norder. The advantage of marriage is all woman’s. The freedom you\r\npropose to give is unfair to you. It’s acceptance by any man would be a\r\ncruel injustice.”\r\n\r\n“Your fine nephew has rejected it with scorn.”\r\n\r\n“Of course he did. He wouldn’t be my nephew if he hadn’t. He’s my\r\nbrother’s son. My brother would have killed any man who made such an\r\noffer to me.”\r\n\r\nEllen smiled and lifted her head.\r\n\r\n“Yes. He also told me he would do as much for any man who offered this\r\nideal to his sister.”\r\n\r\nLucy straightened her slight figure.\r\n\r\n“I’m proud of him for saying it.”\r\n\r\n“Which only shows that neither man nor woman is yet civilized.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly. That’s why you’d better think before you leap all the way\r\nback into barbarism at one bound. It’s bad enough as it is, God knows.\r\nYou propose to aggravate the disease to effect a cure. Come, my child,\r\nforget your theories for a moment and exercise a little common sense.\r\nA true study of human society reveals certain facts. God made woman as\r\nthe supreme instrument for the perpetuation of the race and the saving\r\nof all that man has achieved in the centuries of the past, by passing\r\nit on in the culture of the child. A man under normal conditions\r\nmarries because he wants a woman. A woman marries because she wants\r\na child. A man seeks the woman in his wife. A woman seeks the child\r\nin her husband. A woman lives through her children--a man through his\r\nwork. You propose to seek a man in your mate and ask the man to seek\r\nonly the woman in this free alliance. Your chief aim in life you make\r\nyour work. You must destroy or crush down your instinct for children.\r\nWith the child as the bond your man will remain faithful for life.\r\nWithout it, his eyes will continually roam the world in search of other\r\nwomen, because the supreme law of life has been defied, not fulfilled.”\r\n\r\n“He wants me--not the child,” Ellen maintained.\r\n\r\n“Certainly, you simpleton. Man’s sex-impulse is overwhelmingly stronger\r\nthan woman’s. He may not even desire children in the beginning. But\r\nnature has seen to it that he cannot live without wanting a wife. It is\r\nher business to supply the children.”\r\n\r\n“All right!” Ellen replied. “I propose to meet this grave\r\nresponsibility in my own way and gauge my conduct by higher ideals than\r\nmoth-eaten customs. I propose to rear a nobler race of freemen than\r\nthe world has yet seen. I accept my duty to society as paramount. I\r\nwill be the guardian of the race-body and the race-soul. But I will be\r\nresponsible to myself--my inner, noblest self. I will not be a slave.\r\nI will not sell my sex for my keep, either in the bonds of matrimony\r\nor the bonds of the kept woman outside of marriage. I will not be a\r\nparasite. I will not obey any man who walks this earth. If I must be\r\nthe mother of men, I will be their equal at least. I will be freed from\r\nconventional slavery. I will be freed as woman from the dominion of the\r\nmale. I will rise a full human being or welcome extinction!”\r\n\r\n“But can’t you see, dear heart,” Lucy pleaded, “that your ideal is\r\npurely masculine? You are merely demanding the right to make a man\r\nof yourself! The way of human progress lies in exactly the opposite\r\ndirection if woman is to contribute anything to that progress. Nothing\r\ncan be gained toward lifting the human race to a higher plane by merely\r\nmultiplying the number of men. We must improve the breed of men. This\r\ncan only be done by woman remaining a woman to the highest reach of\r\ndevelopment. Woman’s organic constitution makes her utterly unlike\r\nman. To follow man’s idea would be the most fatal blunder. You wish to\r\nlive the same life and do the same work as man merely to demonstrate\r\nthat you are a human being. God called you to live the highest life of\r\nwhich woman is capable; to lead the way for a higher order of human\r\nbeings. No freedom is worth achieving for woman unless it be to follow\r\nher own nature. The free alliance you propose to your lover is not the\r\ncreature of woman’s imagination. It was borrowed from the masculine\r\nmind in the frantic effort of the modern woman to be a man!”\r\n\r\nEllen stubbornly shook her head.\r\n\r\n“But how can the mere trick of a marriage ceremony perform the miracles\r\nyour ideal demands? If I love Ralph Manning I will love him no more,\r\nno less, ten minutes after the officer of the law has pronounced us\r\nhusband and wife. If he is mean and stingy, the ceremony will not make\r\nhim generous. If he is noble, it will not make him ignoble. If he is a\r\ncriminal, it will not cleanse him of crime----”\r\n\r\n“No,” Lucy broke in, “but because he is a man who has inherited the\r\nfinest instincts of his ancestors the magic of that ceremony will\r\nfix his habits for life. Habit is character. On that home building\r\ncharacter the whole structure of civilization rests----”\r\n\r\nA soft rap at the door interrupted her.\r\n\r\nEllen searched her friend’s face for an explanation. The truth had\r\nflashed into her mind instinctively.\r\n\r\n“You told him to come this morning?” Ellen asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes. I told him to fight it out to-day, dear. I’ve tried to help him.”\r\n\r\nShe rose timidly and drew closer.\r\n\r\n“You don’t resent it?”\r\n\r\nFor the first time in her life Ellen slipped her arms around her\r\nfriend’s slender waist and kissed her.\r\n\r\n“Certainly not, you dear old thing; I feel as if you were my aunt now,\r\nbesides the very best friend I ever had in my life.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll listen to him?”\r\n\r\n“Of course, I’ll listen.”\r\n\r\n“And be sensible?”\r\n\r\n“Surely,” she smiled quizzically.\r\n\r\nLucy kissed her impulsively.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, dear, it’s no use to argue with you. Convince a woman\r\nagainst her will--she’ll be of the same opinion still.”\r\n\r\nAnother gentle rap at the door reminded them that a mere man was\r\nquietly waiting their pleasure.\r\n\r\nLucy quickly opened the door.\r\n\r\n“I’ve done my best, boy,” she whispered, “you’ll have to do the rest.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll win, never fear,” he replied in low tones.\r\n\r\nLucy waved another farewell and hurried away.\r\n\r\nManning advanced smiling.\r\n\r\n“Well, I told you I’d come again to-day.”\r\n\r\nShe met him half way, devouring him with her eyes.\r\n\r\n“My love-man!” she cried.\r\n\r\n“My love-woman!” he whispered, taking her in his arms.\r\n\r\nTheir lips met.\r\n\r\n“You’ll fix the day?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“To-day, if you like.”\r\n\r\nHe suddenly held her at arm’s length.\r\n\r\n“You mean it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nHe swept her again into his arms.\r\n\r\n“You make me the happiest man on earth.”\r\n\r\nHe paused and smiled into her flushed face.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid that remark is not strikingly original!”\r\n\r\n“And I’m afraid you don’t quite understand me,” she said, releasing\r\nherself from his arms.\r\n\r\n“I do,” he answered promptly. “You’ve just promised to marry me to-day.”\r\n\r\n“But in my own way.”\r\n\r\n“My way is the only way, dear heart!”\r\n\r\n“We’ll have as elaborate a ceremony as you like,” she went on evenly,\r\n“provided you don’t bind me with legal chains.”\r\n\r\n“But that’s exactly what I demand,” he insisted. “I want the chains\r\ndouble riveted and I want handcuffs on both my wrists as well as on\r\nyours. The chains can’t be too strong to suit me.”\r\n\r\n“You refuse me?” she asked sternly.\r\n\r\n“I refuse to degrade the woman I love.”\r\n\r\n“Can you think of the wonderful thing that is drawing our souls and\r\nbodies toward each other as degrading?”\r\n\r\n“No, but the world will call it so and I will be responsible for your\r\nmisery.”\r\n\r\n“I defy the world.”\r\n\r\n“Knowing the world better than you do, I decline to aid you in the\r\ndefiance.”\r\n\r\nShe drew close.\r\n\r\n“You can deliberately repulse me when I offer you my soul and body?”\r\n\r\n“Under such conditions, yes.”\r\n\r\nShe drew back with sudden passion. Her voice was husky.\r\n\r\n“All right, you can go, then; I will never see you again!”\r\n\r\nHe looked at her in surprise.\r\n\r\n“You can’t mean this.”\r\n\r\n“I do.”\r\n\r\nShe lifted her hand to wave him to the door and it dropped as if her\r\nstrength had failed.\r\n\r\nQuick to catch the significance of her weakness, he followed her\r\neagerly.\r\n\r\n“You can’t be such a fool,” he cried angrily. “I won’t listen to you.\r\nI’m going to do the thinking and the acting for us both in this crisis.\r\nYou’ve read a lot of radical rubbish and taken it seriously. You’ve\r\nwritten some brilliant essays on the same line and hypnotized yourself\r\ninto the idea that you really believe the stuff you’ve written. You\r\ndon’t. You can’t. It’s crazy nonsense when you try to live such\r\ntheories in this world. And this is the world we’ve got to live in now,\r\nyou know.”\r\n\r\n“That’s just why I’m going to live my life in the light of my ideals,”\r\nshe broke in. “This old, sin-cursed, sneering, practical, material\r\nworld needs the inspiration of high ideals. We have more than enough\r\npractical materialists. You are going to join me in my holy crusade\r\nagainst sham and humbug, lies and slavery.”\r\n\r\n“I’m going to marry you according to law,” he growled.\r\n\r\n“You will not!” she snapped.\r\n\r\nA long silence followed. The man and the woman held each other in a\r\nsteady gaze--will clashing on will in a determined fight for mastery.\r\nThere was no sign of weakening on either side. Her figure slowly\r\nstiffened and the chin rose in defiance.\r\n\r\nWith a gesture of anger he seized his hat and hurried to the door.\r\n\r\n“It’s good-bye, then?”\r\n\r\n“You’re saying it,” she answered stiffly.\r\n\r\n“All right,” he responded in tones so low they were scarcely audible.\r\n\r\nThe door closed softly and Ellen sank into a chair with a sob.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                        THE FLESH AND THE DEVIL\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE reaction from the strain of her fight with her best friend and\r\nlover left Ellen West in a condition of collapse. The bitterness of the\r\nfirst big defeat in her impulsive life was sickening.\r\n\r\n“The fool--the conventional weakling,” she exclaimed in disgust.\r\n\r\nHer sense of humiliation was keen. She had offered herself in abject\r\nsubmission--to give herself freely without condition to a man who\r\nhad refused to take the gift. It was maddening! That her beauty had\r\nfascinated him she knew by intuition keener than reason. And yet her\r\ncharms had fallen short of victory.\r\n\r\nHer soul rose in rebellion against the shame of his rejection, of his\r\nassumption of moral superiority.\r\n\r\n“His ignorance and stupidity!” she hissed.\r\n\r\nWaves of helpless anger swept her. And yet the more she considered his\r\nstern refusal the more reasonable and honorable from the man’s point of\r\nview it seemed. In spite of her creed a sneaking admiration persisted\r\nin the back of her indignant mind.\r\n\r\nAt last this admiration dared to come into full consciousness. She\r\nstamped on it with indignant fury. Her anger at her own inherited\r\nweakness was even greater than her wrath against the man who had\r\nrejected her generous offer.\r\n\r\n“It’s true!” she muttered. “Woman has no soul--she’s merely a mass of\r\ngelatine on which the will of man acts and reacts. I’ll die before I’ll\r\nsubmit!”\r\n\r\nA faint but distinct tap on her wall from Field’s library stopped the\r\ntrain of her angry thought.\r\n\r\nHe had rapped many messages during the past month and had called\r\nmany times from the balcony rail in vain. She had forgotten his very\r\nexistence in the unfolding of her love for Manning.\r\n\r\nShe listened with an amused smile.\r\n\r\n“This is old reliable, fair lady,” he was saying. “Every day I call in\r\nvain. Have pity, pray! Your humble slave awaits you on the backyard\r\nfence--your faithful Tomascat!”\r\n\r\nShe rose with a light laugh, walked to the rear window and looked out.\r\n\r\nHe had just leaped on the balcony rail. His imitation of a cat was\r\nperfect.\r\n\r\n“O-o--Maria--M-a-r-i-i-a!” he called.\r\n\r\n“Come over, Tomascat,” she answered, “and cheer me up!”\r\n\r\n“I come on the run!” he cried as he leaped from the rail and re-entered\r\nhis apartment.\r\n\r\nIn two minutes he was at her door.\r\n\r\n“You needn’t apologize, Ellen,” he began.\r\n\r\n“I’m not apologizing, sir!” she answered quickly.\r\n\r\n“I say you _needn’t_ apologize for your shameful treatment of the\r\nman who really loves you. I know all about your dreadful carrying-on\r\nwith that other fellow.”\r\n\r\nShe waved him to a seat and sat down facing him.\r\n\r\n“And from the length of your face this morning I can guess the ending\r\nof the sad story.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes indeedy,” he continued glibly, “for the past month I’ve held\r\nmyself aloof.”\r\n\r\n“Quite so; you’ve only rapped once a day.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly. I used to rap twice. And, moreover, I used to come right up\r\nand knock at your door with or without an invitation at times. Not once\r\nhave I done this in thirty days. I repeat, I have held myself aloof,\r\nnot because I feared the outcome of this interloper’s attentions, but\r\nbecause I thought it best to let the affair run its course--as in\r\nmeasles and all immature love.”\r\n\r\n“I like that!” Ellen broke in.\r\n\r\n“I’m glad you do. I hoped your mind was still sufficiently alert to get\r\nit. Still, you never can tell. The kind of affair in which you have\r\nbeen floundering has a most benumbing effect on the female mind.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you!”\r\n\r\n“Don’t mention it. No fee expected. My advice is purely friendly, not\r\nlegal. Would you mind telling me the exact stage at which you have\r\narrived with our young friend of bucolic aroma?”\r\n\r\nShe looked at him a moment defiantly.\r\n\r\n“Not in the least. We have declared our love. He asked me to marry him.\r\nI refused and offered myself without a marriage ceremony.”\r\n\r\n“And he indignantly refused?”\r\n\r\n“He did.”\r\n\r\n“I knew he would--the poor rube. And I have come into the kingdom for\r\nsuch a time as this! I alone can save you from folly. You are, after\r\nall, dear Ellen, supremely feminine in your attempt to claim the\r\nprivileges of man----”\r\n\r\n“You’re a liar, Randy----”\r\n\r\n“I deny the allegation, but I will not spurn the ‘alligator’! On the\r\nother hand I draw nearer. I make myself plain. You refuse my offer of a\r\nfree alliance?”\r\n\r\n“Indignantly.”\r\n\r\n“Just so; although I am your comrade in creative art, our tastes are\r\nsimilar, the fiber of character the same----”\r\n\r\n“I don’t love you----”\r\n\r\n“You say that because you don’t know the meaning of love. There is\r\nno true love save the love of comrade and workers. All else is blind\r\nimpulse. The impulse to be a father--the impulse to be a mother,----”\r\n\r\n“Pish--tush!”\r\n\r\n“Pish--tush yourself! I’m telling you the deepest secrets of human\r\nlife. You believe in a free alliance. I offer it. I am a philosopher of\r\nartistic and creative calling. So are you. We are perfectly fitted for\r\nhappiness in each other’s society, in each other’s love. You reject me\r\nlike a silly school girl--why?”\r\n\r\n“Because I don’t love you--fool!”\r\n\r\n“Because you don’t love me in the idiotic way of the old romantic\r\npoets--the way the boy loves, for example. He swears to make you a\r\ngoddess and will end by making you his slave.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll never marry him!”\r\n\r\n“Legally, no. You have worked out a logical creed of individual freedom\r\nfrom purely legal restraints, but what you’re really trying to do is\r\nto bind him and bind yourself with a new and more aggravated form of\r\nmatrimony.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Simply what I say. That the tyranny into which you would lure this\r\npoor simp is more ‘holy,’ more ‘sacred,’ more galling in its chains\r\nthan the old ceremony. In it you have raised the old ceremony to the\r\nnth power.”\r\n\r\n“Our love would be as free as the beat of the human heart.”\r\n\r\n“But you propose to so smother the human heart in the intimacy of\r\nthis personal freedom that it can’t beat. You forswear the chains\r\nof matrimony for a free alliance whose tyranny you intend to make\r\nten times more tyrannical than the old conventional marriage. Why\r\nan ‘alliance’? An alliance is made of agreements and promises and\r\nobligations. It’s just another kind of iron-clad marriage you’re trying\r\nto impose on the world in the name of freedom. It’s a fake, child--a\r\nrank fake. Come, have common sense. You and I are mates, in mind and\r\nbody.”\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n“It’s true. I offer you the real free alliance without bonds, without\r\npromises, without agreements. I offer the glory and beauty of love\r\nwithout chains of any kind. We will work together. We will roam the\r\nfields together. We will think high thoughts and do great deeds in\r\ncreative art as chums and comrades without fighting, hating, or\r\nquarrelling or getting on one another’s nerves. Divest yourself of the\r\nobsession of sex. Woman will never be free as man until she does this.\r\nUse your magnificent sex endowment as an inspiration in life. You are\r\nstill making it the supreme end of life. You understand me?”\r\n\r\n“Yes--go home, Randy--you tire me.”\r\n\r\n“All right. I’ve told you the truth. Remember old reliable is your\r\nneighbor. I’m your best bet in life. I recommend myself highly----”\r\n\r\n“Go home!”\r\n\r\nWith a grin and a friendly nod he left her brooding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n                             A BROKEN WING\r\n\r\n\r\nFIELD’S bold plea for the flesh roused Ellen’s deepest emotional\r\nrevolt. Her first impulse was to strangle the cool, smiling tempter.\r\n\r\nOn reflection, her philosophy of life forbade such violent attempts to\r\nforce another human being to think as she thought. Absolute freedom for\r\neach individual human soul and body was the one principle on which she\r\nwas building the structure of life and thought.\r\n\r\nThe man of Field’s daring, promiscuous impulses must of course be\r\ncontrolled in the new moral world in which the words husband, wife,\r\nparent, and child would become legally obsolete. Just how this could be\r\ndone presented to her mind a problem. There must be a solution. There\r\ncould be but one. He must be controlled by love. The magic glow of her\r\npassion for Manning warmed her heart with sudden tenderness. Such love\r\nwas the solution of every problem of human life.\r\n\r\nShe rose with renewed courage to fight for her ideal and live or die by\r\nits standard.\r\n\r\nShe set herself resolutely to work. The first days of her separation\r\nfrom Manning passed swiftly. She literally buried herself in work.\r\nShe was surprised at the strength and exhaustless vitality of her\r\nimagination under the new inspiration of love. She worked as never\r\nbefore--eight, ten, twelve and at last fourteen hours a day and stopped\r\nat midnight with stores of energy still untouched.\r\n\r\nManning would call before the end of the week. Of that she was sure.\r\nShe felt no serious uneasiness until Saturday afternoon.\r\n\r\n“A very wise young man!” she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nShe watched the hands of her clock slowly move to three. He had never\r\nfailed to call on Saturday afternoon before three.\r\n\r\nA sudden panic seized her. Could he toss her aside so easily as a vain\r\nand worthless experiment? It was preposterous. His love was the real\r\nthing. She felt this with unerring certainty. Her intuitions were too\r\nkeen to make a mistake about a thing so vital to her happiness.\r\n\r\nShe seized the telephone to call the office and ask for him.\r\n\r\n“I’ll not humiliate myself!” she groaned.\r\n\r\nShe slammed the telephone down with such violence the receiver fell off\r\nthe hook.\r\n\r\nAnd then the ridiculous side of her rage suddenly dawned. Why should a\r\nfull-grown woman, who claimed equal rights with man, in all things on\r\nthe earth above or beneath it, attempt to play the coy maiden who sits\r\npatiently at home and waits to be courted by her mate?\r\n\r\n“Bah--such nonsense!” she cried.\r\n\r\nShe seized the telephone boldly and called Manning’s office.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Manning is not in!” sighed the telephone girl.\r\n\r\n“Not in?”\r\n\r\n“Not in.”\r\n\r\n“Where is he?”\r\n\r\n“In Chicago, on business for the paper. He told me to tell any one who\r\nmight call that he would be gone a month.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you.”\r\n\r\nThe conceited young ass had expected her to call and she had! Served\r\nher right for being such a fool. Well, the lesson was needed and she\r\nhad gotten it--straight between the eyes.\r\n\r\nLucy Sheldon would know all about it, of course. But she wouldn’t ask\r\nher. The little match-making minx of the old marriage régime had no\r\ndoubt planned the whole thing and sent her handsome nephew away on the\r\ntrip in order to bring her to her senses. She resented the assumption\r\nthat she had parted with her senses.\r\n\r\n“Fools,” she muttered, “I’ll show them two can play the game.”\r\n\r\nA low muffled tapping on the wall stopped her angry arraignment of\r\nManning and Lucy.\r\n\r\nField was calling again.\r\n\r\nIt was uncanny the way he would call at the moment when her mind could\r\nleast resist his wit and insolence.\r\n\r\n“Come out on the balcony, Fair Ladie, I’ve somewhat to say to thee!”\r\n\r\nShe walked to the window and found him climbing out.\r\n\r\nHe waved a jovial salute.\r\n\r\n“I’m lonely, Fair Ladie!” he called.\r\n\r\n“So am I, rude man!”\r\n\r\n“May I come over?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Then you’ll come over here, perchance?”\r\n\r\n“Perchance--I will not.”\r\n\r\n“Walk with me, then, through the woods on the Jersey hills--my car is\r\nin the shops.”\r\n\r\n“All right; I’ll meet you downstairs.”\r\n\r\nThe stroll through the deep-wooded cliffs of the Palisades soothed her\r\nanger. The lines of the city’s tall buildings were half smothered in\r\na haze that melted into clouds and made it seem unreal. There was no\r\nhurrying, rushing, maddening New York. It was only a dream. The woods\r\nand sky and water and rocks and birds were realities--all else myth.\r\nEven the man beside her, who persisted in his idiotic determination to\r\ncarry her across the rough places, was a fiction.\r\n\r\nAltogether Field seemed the most unreal thing in the universe to-day.\r\nShe had accepted his invitation to test the strength of his appeal to\r\nher. Now that she was alone with him in the deep woods there was no\r\nappeal. His chatter about love and comradeship and high achievement\r\nfell on deaf ears. Her soul was a thousand miles away.\r\n\r\n“That’s just it!” she breathed, “exactly a thousand miles away, in the\r\nsmoky city by the lake!”\r\n\r\nShe stopped suddenly.\r\n\r\n“It’s no use, Randy,” she said forlornly. “You bore me dreadfully\r\nto-day.”\r\n\r\n“Bore you?” he repeated in surprise.\r\n\r\n“Yes. Forgive my plain speech. But I’m in love.”\r\n\r\nShe sat down on a rock and looked up into his mocking eyes through a\r\nmist in her own.\r\n\r\n“In love with a doggoned, stubborn country boy who insists on his own\r\nway and I won’t have it, that’s all--I won’t have it!”\r\n\r\nHer hat had fallen from her hand, and her lips trembled. Field shook\r\nhis head and touched her hair gently.\r\n\r\n“Better let him have his way, child.”\r\n\r\n“Never!”\r\n\r\n“It’s best for you.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll die first!”\r\n\r\n“You may die for it anyhow. As well first as last.”\r\n\r\n“I’m no weakling and you know it.”\r\n\r\n“No, but you’re the marrying kind and don’t know it.”\r\n\r\n“I’m nothing of the sort!”\r\n\r\n“The only difference is you’re trying to invent a marriage chain\r\nwarranted never to break.”\r\n\r\n“Shut up!” she snapped.\r\n\r\nField threw up his hands in full surrender.\r\n\r\n“We return then to the haunts of man where your grief may flow\r\nunchecked to the sea?”\r\n\r\n“Forgive me, Randy!” she cried suddenly.\r\n\r\nShe shook the spell of her emotion from her, sprang to her feet and\r\nroamed the woods with a free careless joy that surprised her companion.\r\n\r\n“By George, you amaze me!” he said at last.\r\n\r\n“And why?”\r\n\r\n“You’re a wonder,” he replied, shaking his head. “I’m more in love with\r\nyou than ever.”\r\n\r\n“It’s no use--forget it.”\r\n\r\n“It may be no use, but we’ll not forget it.”\r\n\r\nThey reached the paved road along which automobiles were whizzing in\r\nboth directions as a classy little roadster passed with a pretty girl\r\nalone at the wheel.\r\n\r\n“Sensible girl!” Field sighed. “She owns and drives her own car, fancy\r\nfree----”\r\n\r\n“And roams the world seeking whom she may devour, no doubt.”\r\n\r\n“Possibly.”\r\n\r\n“She caught your eye, I noticed!” Ellen laughed.\r\n\r\n“Never touched me!” he protested.\r\n\r\n“You can’t help it, Randy, any more than you can stop your breathing by\r\na moral resolution.”\r\n\r\nThey walked to the ferry in silence the greater part of the way. It\r\nwasn’t necessary for either to talk unless they wished.\r\n\r\nEllen had formed a sudden resolution that absorbed her. That car was\r\na good idea. She had always longed for the freedom which such wings\r\nwould give. With it she need not be incumbered with a love-making man.\r\nThe woods and fields and long, winding roads would be hers. She had\r\nmoney enough now to own one. The fresh air would restore her poise and\r\nself-respect.\r\n\r\nEarly Monday morning she bought it and devoted the afternoons of the\r\nentire week to lessons in driving. She was an apt pupil. Her strength\r\nand cool brain soon gave her quick mastery of its every mood. By the\r\nend of the week she was sweeping over the hills and valleys of New\r\nJersey with the ease of a veteran.\r\n\r\nShe took Field for a spin on the following Sunday. He was fascinated\r\nby her skill and sureness of touch.\r\n\r\n“I’m glad I noticed that girl in the car,” he said musingly.\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Otherwise we wouldn’t own this one, would we?”\r\n\r\n“We would. You flatter yourself unduly. I had made up my mind to buy\r\nthe car before your slow eye had even caught the swish of the girl’s\r\nveil in the wind.”\r\n\r\n“The times are out of joint!” Field sighed.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter with them?”\r\n\r\n“The girls are getting too swift for my clumsy ways.”\r\n\r\nEllen laughed heartily.\r\n\r\nField touched her gloved hand.\r\n\r\n“Keep your hand off my wheel!” she commanded sharply.\r\n\r\nHe dropped his hand like a naughty schoolboy who felt the teacher’s\r\nrule.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Ma’am!” he sighed.\r\n\r\nShe permitted him to go to the garage and watch her give orders to the\r\nattendants. He walked home with her in an unusually thoughtful mood.\r\nThey paused at the doorway downstairs. He looked at her earnestly for a\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n“You’re not fooling me a little bit,” he began slowly, “with all this\r\nrush of new experiences and excitement outdoors. You’re just trying to\r\nhide the hurt inside. It’s not the way, my comrade. The way to forget\r\na lover who is unworthy of your love is to accept the one who is.\r\nCome, be sensible. Keep your freedom and yet sweep the gamut of human\r\npassion and human emotion. You and I can form a true alliance of free\r\ncomradeship. We have similar tastes and ideals. We work at the same\r\ndivine art--the big creative art of letters. We live side by side. The\r\nsecret of our love will be our own. Let’s marry to-night with the free\r\nceremony of the new thought and the new world.”\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n“It’s a waste of breath, Randy.”\r\n\r\n“Why--why?” he pleaded.\r\n\r\n“I--don’t--love--you----”\r\n\r\n“I’ll teach you how----”\r\n\r\n“No, my man of mind and muscle; you learn to love through your\r\nsenses--woman only becomes sensuous when she loves. I want my own man\r\nnow and I’m going to have him.”\r\n\r\nHer lips suddenly closed in grim resolution. She pressed Field’s hand,\r\nnodded good-night and rapidly mounted to her apartment.\r\n\r\nShe was glad he had pressed his suit at that crucial moment. She had\r\nreached the depths of despair to-day. Never had she felt so keenly her\r\nloneliness and the humiliation of defeat as in the instant of parting\r\nat the close of the day of excitement. Nothing could have so cleared\r\nher mind of cobwebs as Field’s straight appeal to her senses.\r\n\r\nHer course was clear as day. She would throw her silly pride to the\r\nwinds, court her lover and make him her own! Why not, in heaven’s name,\r\nif she claimed equal rights with man, should she not choose her mate,\r\npursue him openly and win him in a fair fight?\r\n\r\n“I can do it and I will!” she resolved fiercely.\r\n\r\nShe called Lucy Sheldon and asked her for Manning’s address.\r\nIncidentally she learned much of deep interest about him.\r\n\r\n“No, he didn’t run away at all, you silly goose,” her friend answered.\r\n“Brown sent him to Chicago to report a sensational trial. It’s the\r\nchance of his life. If he lands it, his salary will be doubled.”\r\n\r\n“Hasn’t thought of me once?”\r\n\r\n“I oughtn’t to tell you the truth, I suppose----”\r\n\r\n“Please.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t deserve to know it, but he’s been unutterably miserable. My\r\nletters have been his only comfort and I’ve had to tell him the truth\r\nabout your scandalous flirtation with Field.”\r\n\r\n“How dare you!”\r\n\r\n“It’s the truth and you know it!”\r\n\r\n“It’s false and you know it!”\r\n\r\nLucy laughed.\r\n\r\n“I’m so glad to hear your indignant denial. Of course, I haven’t\r\nwritten him about it. I’ve just been sick over it myself.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks for your lofty opinion of me.”\r\n\r\n“What else could I think with your crazy ideas of freedom and your\r\ncrazier ideas of marriage?”\r\n\r\n“He has been unhappy?”\r\n\r\n“Miserable.”\r\n\r\n“I’m glad. I’ll write him now just what I think of him.”\r\n\r\n“Do; he’ll be very happy if you tell him the truth.”\r\n\r\n“You’re hopeless, Lucy.”\r\n\r\nWith a bang she hung up the receiver and hurried to her desk. Her\r\nletter to Manning was brief, but it made him foolishly happy.\r\n\r\nIn a room at a cheap hotel, buried in papers, his hair dishevelled,\r\nand his collar discarded, his shirt unbuttoned, he was working with\r\ntireless energy when the bell-boy pushed open his door. Furious at the\r\ninterruption he glared at the intruder.\r\n\r\n“What’ell, Bill!” he growled.\r\n\r\n“Special delivery, sir,” was the drawling reply.\r\n\r\nManning leaped to his feet, his heart beating fiercely. He had felt it\r\ncoming for the past twenty-four hours--a foolish buoyancy had braced\r\nhim in his work. He had begun to think he had recovered from his\r\nwound. He seized the letter and saw her smooth, fine handwriting. A\r\nspecial delivery stamp on it, too! He read it at a glance.\r\n\r\nDEAR LOVE-MAN:\r\n\r\n Please hurry home. I can’t live without you.\r\n\r\n                             Always yours,\r\n\r\n                                                                 ELLEN.\r\n\r\nHe kissed it, laughed and kissed it again.\r\n\r\n“That’s what I call a real love letter!” he exclaimed rapturously.\r\n\r\nHe finished his work the following day and caught the Limited for\r\nNew York. With every click of the swift flying wheels over the steel\r\nrails his heart beat a responsive love-note. She had surrendered her\r\nfoolish whims. They would be married now and the real life of serious\r\nachievement begin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                           THE EAGLE’S NEST\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM the moment Field’s final proposal had cleared her mind, Ellen West\r\nnever faltered in her purpose. She knew exactly what she was going to\r\ndo and set about it.\r\n\r\nHer plan demanded a certain amount of fencing with Manning, which was\r\nnot to her liking, but it couldn’t be helped. To let him know her real\r\npurpose would be a fatal mistake.\r\n\r\nIt required all her tact to prevent an explosion the day he arrived.\r\nHe bounded into her room as if shot out of a catapult. He had all but\r\nswept her into his arms before she could stop him.\r\n\r\n“It’s all settled, dearest,” he cried, “isn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“Not exactly,” she faltered.\r\n\r\n“Then what did your letter mean?”\r\n\r\n“Just what it said.”\r\n\r\n“It said everything.”\r\n\r\n“No, it didn’t. But I meant every word of it. I can’t live without you\r\nand I don’t intend to try. You must come to my way of thinking or I\r\nmust come to yours--in the end--don’t you see?”\r\n\r\n“I see that you must come to my way because there is no other when a\r\ndecent fellow loves a true woman.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll grant all that for a moment, but while we decide who shall yield\r\non this all-important issue, why quarrel? I refuse to quarrel. I love\r\nyou. I must see you and I will if I hunt you down in your office and\r\nsit on your doorstep in the twilight--do you hear?”\r\n\r\nHe smiled boyishly.\r\n\r\n“Then I’ll have my way in the end.”\r\n\r\n“If you can, all right; stop sulking now and be a good boy. Come to see\r\nme--laugh and talk and work with me as you did once. While we fight it\r\nout, surely we can be good friends, can’t we?”\r\n\r\n“Of course!”\r\n\r\nHe grasped her outstretched hand and held it firmly.\r\n\r\n“But I’ve no rights as an accepted lover under such conditions,” he\r\nwent on. “It wouldn’t be fair. I refuse to take advantage of your\r\nfoolish ideals. I’m not your accepted lover until you promise to marry\r\nme. We’re just good friends and pals--you understand my scruples?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” she answered, with a flush. “I haven’t asked you to play\r\nthe rôle of fiancé, have I?”\r\n\r\nHe lifted his finger.\r\n\r\n“You said we wouldn’t quarrel.”\r\n\r\n“Nor will I,” she agreed. “Friends and pals it shall be for\r\nevermore----”\r\n\r\n“Until you’re mine!” he responded gravely.\r\n\r\nFor a month not a day passed without his hour of conference in the\r\nmorning and his evening in her library or on the roof. Theatres,\r\nconcerts, receptions--all were tabooed. His salary had been doubled and\r\nhis responsibilities were increasingly grave. She bent every energy\r\nof her intelligence to the guidance of his work. Her intuitions were\r\nuncanny in their accuracy and he studied her with increasing admiration\r\nas a creative genius entirely apart from his growing love.\r\n\r\nHis personal attitude he held within the strictest bonds of\r\nconventional friendship. He made a solemn vow never to kiss her again\r\nor take her in his arms until she promised to marry him. It was a point\r\nof honor. He held it with Spartan sternness. She knew the process of\r\nhis reasoning and accepted his stubborn insistence on the old code as\r\npart of his fundamental character.\r\n\r\nShe felt the daily resistless growth of his fascination. He couldn’t\r\nkeep his eyes off her. He could hold his hands and put down the impulse\r\nto kiss her lips, which she communicated to his sensitive mind with\r\ndeliberate alluring suggestion, but he could not control the tell-tale\r\nlook out of his eyes. Again and again she caught him looking at her\r\nwith a longing that was agony. And she knew that she was winning the\r\nbattle with his iron will.\r\n\r\nAt last his longing was more than he could endure in silence. He seized\r\nher hand with trembling violence.\r\n\r\n“You can’t go on torturing me like this, my sweetheart. We say we’re\r\nfriends. We know we’re not. You can’t keep this fight up against every\r\nimpulse of body and soul----”\r\n\r\n“I’m not keeping it up!” she interrupted.\r\n\r\n“Of course, you are,” he protested. “I’ll marry you to-night----”\r\n\r\n“I’ll give all to-night and scorn the chains of slaves!”\r\n\r\n“But you can’t live to yourself or die to yourself. We live in the\r\nworld and we’re part of it. Your creed is anarchy.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you what we’ll do,” she interrupted; “we’ll run up for\r\nthe week-end to see a friend of mine in a quaint log cottage in the\r\nmountains. Close to the heart of nature, we’ll face this thing for two\r\nwhole days and fight it to a finish one way or the other--what do you\r\nsay?”\r\n\r\nHis face brightened at the prospect and then clouded.\r\n\r\n“I can’t get off the paper.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll get you off.”\r\n\r\n“Then it’s a go.”\r\n\r\nWithout delay she pulled the strings with the managing editor and\r\nsecured Manning’s release for the two days, Saturday and Sunday. He\r\nalso consented to waive the Friday afternoon preceding. She had taken\r\nno chance of refusal at the office. A brief telephone call direct to\r\nBrown had turned the trick.\r\n\r\nThe two days intervening, Wednesday and Thursday, she spent in\r\npreparations. She devoted the entire time to the coming event. She was\r\ntoo busy for a meeting with her lover.\r\n\r\nTo his urgent plea for a chat or a walk or a ride in the little\r\nroadster there was but one answer:\r\n\r\n“I can’t, man. I’m too busy training for the coming bout with you. I’ll\r\nsee you Friday afternoon at exactly four o’clock at my place on the\r\navenue. Don’t be late a second.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll be waiting on the doorstep!” was the cheerful response.\r\n\r\nAt exactly two minutes before the appointed hour she swept against the\r\ncurb in the trim little car. He threw his grip in and sprang to the\r\nseat.\r\n\r\n“You’re all ready?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“No baggage?” he enquired.\r\n\r\n“My friend has everything I’ll need. I’m at home up there.”\r\n\r\nThe car swept down the avenue, turned into West Twenty-third Street and\r\nin a minute swung into Eighth Avenue.\r\n\r\n“Which way?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“The Weehawken Ferry to the Palisades and the road to Bear Mountain.”\r\n\r\n“Bear Mountain--that sounds good!” he said, snuggling against her a\r\nlittle in spite of his Spartan resolutions to maintain the strict basis\r\nof friendship.\r\n\r\nEllen turned a radiant smile on his face that fairly blinded him. The\r\nease with which she handled the car in the crowded streets of New\r\nYork was a constant surprise. The machine seemed a part of her very\r\nheart-beat. Machinery was something he had never tried to understand.\r\nHe had no desire to monkey with it. He regarded a woman who dared to\r\nhandle it as a sort of super-woman. He was not surprised at Ellen. It\r\nseemed the natural thing for the self-reliant leader of the modern\r\ncrusade to put her hand on the throat of an automobile and run it as\r\nshe pleased.\r\n\r\nHe submitted himself to her authority as a chauffeur without question\r\nand in perfect confidence. He was sure that she knew exactly what she\r\nwas doing. But when it came to submission to her leadership in life in\r\nthe big issue of a home--well--that was another question. He renewed\r\nhis resolutions to boss that job in his own way.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of the woodland roads along the Palisades and over the\r\nJersey hills and valleys was a constant surprise to his keenly awakened\r\nsenses.\r\n\r\n“I had no idea this country was so beautiful!” he exclaimed with\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\n“It’s more beautiful to-day, I think,” she said demurely, “than ever\r\nbefore.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder why!” he laughed.\r\n\r\nHe thoroughly enjoyed the wonderful drive. The long stretches of smooth\r\nroad overlooking the Hudson with its silver mirror reflecting the dark\r\ngreen hills and mountains sent the blood tingling to his finger-tips.\r\n\r\nAnd the soft touch of the woman he loved close beside him was the\r\nmagic that gave new meaning to it all. He had viewed beautiful scenery\r\nbefore. Never had it affected his spirits like this. He half closed\r\nhis eyes. The throb of the engine seemed the beat of the heart of a\r\ngreat eagle. They were flying in space with the quiet beautiful world\r\nstretching in silver and green below!\r\n\r\nBeyond Nyack the hills grew into mountains and the quiet beauty into\r\nrugged grandeur. A great awe filled his heart.\r\n\r\nHis hand moved toward hers involuntarily. He stopped himself in time.\r\nIt was certainly no place for spooning when your girl held the wheel\r\nof a little racer making forty miles an hour over a dangerous mountain\r\nroad.\r\n\r\nBesides, it would have been a terrible break in his resolutions. She\r\nwould have had the laugh on him, to say nothing of the sharp rebuke he\r\nwould have gotten for imperilling two lives.\r\n\r\nHe straightened himself and frowned. He began to foresee danger in this\r\nhigh altitude. He wondered what sort of cottage it was, how many people\r\nin it, how many servants, and what their chances would be for the long\r\ntalks of which he had been dreaming. It would certainly be a mess if\r\nthey should be so petted and coddled as star guests that they could\r\nhave no time to be alone.\r\n\r\nHe glanced at Ellen’s flushed face and saw a smile playing about the\r\ncorners of the sensitive mouth. He was reassured. She had too much\r\ncommon sense to lead him into a crowd of chattering idiots. He threw\r\noff his fears and his heart began to sing its old love-song with a new\r\nsense of triumph.\r\n\r\nThey swept suddenly into a beautiful park, swarming with thousands of\r\nmerrymakers.\r\n\r\nA steamer had just tied up at the pier and three thousand people were\r\npouring from its side and streaming up the steep hill.\r\n\r\n“For the love o’ Mike,” he cried, “have we slipped a cog and run into\r\nConey Island?”\r\n\r\n“Heaven forbid,” was the laughing reply. “This is Bear Mountain. New\r\nYork is just beginning to know about it.”\r\n\r\n“What in heaven’s name is it--a beer-garden?”\r\n\r\n“No, my ignorant youth from the country; it’s a great Inter-State Park,\r\ncomprising thousands of acres of wild mountains, rivers, lakes and\r\nendless reaches of wooded hills.”\r\n\r\nThe car stopped at the signal of a traffic officer to let a crowd\r\ncross the road. They were a jolly lot--lovers, lovers, lovers, endless\r\nprocessions of lovers. Some were holding hands, some were shy, some\r\nlaughing, some in the depths of their first quarrel--but over all the\r\nspirit of joy brooded.\r\n\r\nManning caught the contagion. It went to his Head like wine. He laughed\r\nin spite of himself.\r\n\r\n“Shall we stop and take a spin on that lake over there?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“No; we haven’t time. It’s a long pull up our mountain.”\r\n\r\nSomething about the way she spoke the words “long pull” caught his\r\nimagination and fired it with happiness. It would be wonderful to take\r\na long pull away from the crowded world into the deep shaded gorges of\r\nthe mountains with the woman he loved! He began to picture the narrow\r\nmountain road.\r\n\r\nIn half an hour they were on it and he smiled at the inadequacy of his\r\neffort to imagine half its charm. Up and up and up the narrow thread\r\nwound beside the deep gorges and over the crests of the lower ranges\r\nand up again, always up, to greater heights.\r\n\r\nShe swung the car right or left at each cross road without a moment’s\r\npause.\r\n\r\n“You’ve been here before?” he observed.\r\n\r\n“I’ve walked it a dozen times.”\r\n\r\n“Alone?”\r\n\r\n“Once or twice.”\r\n\r\nHe sighed and wondered who was with her the other times. A very\r\ndisconcerting sweetheart, this new, wilful, headstrong, self-poised\r\nmodern woman! He couldn’t help wondering for just a moment how far\r\nshe had allowed men of Field’s type to go with her. He dismissed the\r\nugly thought with indignation. It was absurd. The woman by his side\r\nwas as pure as the breath of this mountain air. No matter how foul the\r\natmosphere of the great city in which she lived, about her always was\r\nthe living charm of a clean heart.\r\n\r\nHe began to feel the exhilaration of the high altitude in quickened\r\npulse. It sent the blood to his brain in waves of boyish joy.\r\n\r\nHe crossed his arms to keep from touching her.\r\n\r\n“I’m foolishly happy,” he observed with a grin.\r\n\r\n“I knew you would be,” she replied.\r\n\r\n“Nobody seems to live up here,” he remarked as they turned another\r\nridge and swept the inspiring panorama of three ranges. “We haven’t\r\nseen a human in five miles.”\r\n\r\n“That’s why it’s worth the climb.”\r\n\r\n“And only two automobile tracks on the road that I can make out.”\r\n\r\n“There isn’t much travel on this trail,” she admitted.\r\n\r\n“It would be a joke if your friends should be away.”\r\n\r\n“Would you mind much?” she inquired archly.\r\n\r\nHe hesitated.\r\n\r\n“Only for your sake.”\r\n\r\n“You surely couldn’t think that I would mind.”\r\n\r\n“It would be against your religion, wouldn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“I should feel disgraced if I were upset by a little thing like\r\nthat--if my love-man were with me.”\r\n\r\nThe last words were spoken in a lazy tenderness that found his heart.\r\n\r\n“Hush--you make me forget my resolutions.”\r\n\r\n“So soon?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. If I don’t do better than this I can see my finish in the two\r\ndays’ fight we’ve planned.”\r\n\r\nShe fixed him with a tender look, and he turned to the scenery for\r\nrelief. She knew that he didn’t mean quite that. She knew that the iron\r\nwill still slumbered beneath his light banter and yet she sang for joy\r\nthat he had even toyed with the idea of surrender. He had played with\r\nit--otherwise such a remark would have been impossible.\r\n\r\nShe swung the little car straight to the right and flew down a long,\r\nstraight stretch of road leading directly toward the river. Through\r\nvistas of overhanging boughs he caught the flash of its waters in the\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nThe car suddenly curved into an open space on the cliff and shot into\r\na garage perched on the rocks between two trees. He could see that the\r\nrear windows looked out into space. Beyond it lay the sheer precipice\r\nof the mountain-side and the wide reach of the Hudson.\r\n\r\n“We’re here!” she cried joyously.\r\n\r\n“Where on earth’s the house?” he inquired anxiously.\r\n\r\n“We’ll find it all right,” she answered, “unless a slight earthquake\r\nhas shaken it off into the river during the night.”\r\n\r\nHis curiosity was excited. The stillness of the place was uncanny. It\r\nseemed a thousand miles from a human, habitation--not a sign of a cat\r\nor a dog, or a chicken about it.\r\n\r\n“Come on!” she cried.\r\n\r\nHe followed her down a narrow path between huge boulders, beneath giant\r\ntrees for two hundred yards and crossed a laughing brook. The pathway\r\nfollowed the edge of the stream for two hundred yards more and suddenly\r\nstopped before a log cottage built squarely across the brook.\r\n\r\nHe stood entranced.\r\n\r\n“Isn’t it beautiful!” he exclaimed. “It hangs on the very edge of the\r\ncliff, too. And the brook makes a bridal-veil falls as it dashes into\r\nfoam over the rugged ledge!”\r\n\r\n“Yes; listen,” she whispered, “you can hear its weird music.”\r\n\r\nHe stood still for a moment and held his breath. The music of the tiny\r\nfalls came faint and low like an echo chorus to the babble of the brook\r\nover the rocks at their feet. A slight mist rose white and ghost-like\r\nfrom below.\r\n\r\n“It’s a fairyland,” he breathed.\r\n\r\n“Come in,” she said simply. “My friends are on a visit to some\r\nneighbors. They didn’t expect us so soon. I came an hour earlier on\r\npurpose to have it all alone with you in your first impressions.”\r\n\r\nThe door was unlocked and they entered the spacious living-room. At\r\none end stood a huge fireplace built of boulders. Toward the cliff,\r\noverlooking the river, three large windows were cut, with a couch seat\r\nprojecting into space. It was piled with pillows and from its inviting\r\nperch entrancing views stretched in three directions--across the river\r\nto the hills beyond--up the river’s edge, over which hung still higher,\r\ndarker mountain peaks, and down the river through endless, sunlit\r\nstretches of water and white, gleaming villages along its banks.\r\n\r\nHe sat down in the window and gazed in awe.\r\n\r\n“It’s wonderful!” he exclaimed at last.\r\n\r\n“Drink it in,” she responded cheerfully, “while I get something to eat.”\r\n\r\n“Good; I’m starved!”\r\n\r\n“Make yourself at home,” she called from the kitchen. “Clark, the\r\npresident of my company, used to pay the taxes on this place, but I own\r\nit. They don’t stay here enough to know what it’s like.”\r\n\r\nThrough the rapture of his soul, bewitched by the wonderful view, he\r\ncaught enough of her chatter to know that all was well, and he could\r\ndream undisturbed for a brief while. He abandoned himself to the\r\nspell. He looked at the inscription over the big stuffed eagle perched\r\non a bough above the mantel--“_The Eagle’s Nest_.” He felt himself\r\nan eagle resting for a moment high up on the overhanging cliff. A new\r\nsense of freedom and power welled within him. The call of elemental\r\nthings throbbed in his veins. He felt for the first time his kinship to\r\nthe wild, free world whose inheritance still beat in his blood.\r\n\r\nThe sun was setting in a riot of gorgeous colors reflected in the great\r\nsilver mirror below. He was surprised to see the gleam of red and\r\nyellow in the tall tree-tops. It couldn’t be possible the leaves were\r\nturning thus early in September. He looked closely and found it was\r\ntrue. He felt the first tingling breath of fall in the air.\r\n\r\nHe turned instinctively toward the fireplace and found to his amazement\r\nthat a glowing blaze of logs had begun to brighten the room. The table\r\nwas set before the fireplace and he smelled a hot dinner. He looked in\r\nsurprise again. How long had he been dreaming?\r\n\r\nHe sprang to his feet. The people had probably come and entered by the\r\nkitchen door.\r\n\r\n“Ellen!” he called.\r\n\r\n“Yes, dear!” came the cheerful answer from the kitchen.\r\n\r\n“Can’t I help you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Find your room--the first door on the left, next to mine, and\r\nwash your face and hands for dinner. Hurry up, like a good boy, now.\r\nIt’s all ready.”\r\n\r\nHe hurried into the tiny bedroom. The furniture held him in spite of\r\nhis desire to make haste. The bed was built of peeled logs. The bureau\r\nand chiffonier and every piece of the same. The effect was charming. He\r\nimagined himself a clumsy young eagle rummaging about in a nest of dry\r\nsticks somewhere in the clouds.\r\n\r\nEverything about the place seemed to aggravate the sense of boyish\r\nexhilaration which he felt with increasing intensity.\r\n\r\n“It’s the high air, of course,” he mused, “but I’ll swear I’m a little\r\ndrunk.”\r\n\r\nTo his surprise he found running water in the set wash-basin and two\r\nfaucets, hot and cold, and each of them in perfect order. Of course it\r\nwas easy to pipe it from the hill above and the fire in the kitchen\r\nrange accounted for the flow of hot water.\r\n\r\nHe changed his collar and cravat and brushed his suit with care. The\r\nfolks had come. Of this he had no doubt. He would meet them at dinner.\r\nThey were certainly a quiet couple. He couldn’t wonder at that. Human\r\nbeings could not live in such air and not be born again.\r\n\r\nAs he emerged into the living-room, prepared to receive the formal\r\nannouncement of his name to the host and hostess, he stopped speechless\r\nat the vision which greeted him.\r\n\r\nEllen was just entering with the tea tray. A more bewitching picture\r\nnever met his eye. She had removed her corsets and slipped into a\r\ndark, blood-red negligee trimmed in black fur. The snow-white neck and\r\nshoulders framed in low V-shape setting flashed a living ivory. Her\r\ncheeks were red. Her eyes sparkled with mischievous happiness. Ringlets\r\nof waving brown hair hung about her face in tantalizing beauty.\r\n\r\n“I sincerely trust,” she cried, “that you duly appreciate the honor\r\nI am paying to mere man by playing the humble rôle of cook to his\r\nmajesty!”\r\n\r\nHe stared, transfixed in amazement.\r\n\r\nShe busied herself with the tray, placed the service for two, and\r\nhurried back into the kitchen for the dinner. His eyes followed her\r\nwith eager admiration. She walked with a sinuous grace that was\r\nbewitching. Never had he realized the stunning beauty of her superb\r\nfigure as in the simple drapery of this blood-red, fur-trimmed robe.\r\n\r\nHe was still dazed by the vision when she reappeared with the loaded\r\ntray, her eyes laughing at his embarrassment.\r\n\r\n“His majesty displeased?” she inquired.\r\n\r\n“I’m dumb,” he gasped; “dumbfounded, keeled over, completely knocked\r\nout!”\r\n\r\n“Say not so, dear boy, say not so!” she laughed. “I pride myself\r\non my cooking. On one point, at least, I’m the incarnation of your\r\nold-fashioned housewife. I will say that the man who marries me will\r\nget a good cook. You should collapse after the meal, not before.”\r\n\r\n“What on earth will these people think when they pop in and find that\r\nwe’re running the whole place to suit ourselves?”\r\n\r\n“And what care we? I told you that Clark used to pay the taxes, but I\r\nown it--didn’t I?”\r\n\r\nHe glanced uneasily at the door.\r\n\r\nShe placed an armchair at the table and drew another opposite.\r\n\r\n“Dinner is served, your majesty!”\r\n\r\nShe made the daintiest bow, Japanese fashion, and spread her arms in\r\nmock obedience.\r\n\r\n“I’ll wake up in a minute!” he sighed.\r\n\r\n“Please don’t.”\r\n\r\nThey sat down and looked into each other’s faces in silence, smiling.\r\nHis expression of boyish humor slowly deepened into tender appeal.\r\n\r\n“Dear love-woman,” he began slowly, “you don’t know how this picture\r\noverwhelms me. It’s the dream of my soul--the sweet intimacy of this\r\nlife within the prison of four walls with you! Can’t you see it my way,\r\ndearest?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps I do--only with clearer eyes and deeper insight into\r\nrealities,” she responded gravely. “You like this rustic furniture,\r\ndon’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Why? Because it suggests the freedom of an eagle’s nest in the\r\ntree-top. I like it, too. Were we married, every piece of furniture in\r\nour establishment would be so many links in the chain that bind two\r\nslaves to eternal servitude.”\r\n\r\n“I’d kiss the chain which bound you to me and me to you for life.”\r\n\r\n“I think you’ve said that once before--and you mean it now. You’d think\r\nso until you feel the chains begin to gall the bruised flesh. Can’t\r\nyou understand, dear man, that a woman who has once felt the throb\r\nof a conscious free soul cannot allow herself to be classed as your\r\nproperty, your home, your ox, your ass?”\r\n\r\nAn impulsive answer moved his lips, but the words died unspoken. She\r\nwas so radiantly beautiful it was a sacrilege to cross her.\r\n\r\n“I’m hungry,” he complained.\r\n\r\nShe smiled triumphantly and poured his tea. Through the long wonderful\r\nhour at the table no word of argument broke the spell. They talked of\r\ntrifles--the mountains, the hills, the majestic river, the peace and\r\nquiet of the eagle’s nest.\r\n\r\nShe watched his face intently, and wondered what tumult was raging\r\nwithin and at what point the storm would break. That a storm was\r\nbrewing she could feel with increasing intensity. She caught it in the\r\nlittle nervous twitching about the corners of his mouth and a new fire\r\nthat glowed in the depths of his eyes.\r\n\r\nShe was not surprised at his sudden move at the end of the meal. He\r\nrose abruptly and paced the floor, his hands gripped behind his back.\r\nHe paused and looked through the open window at the shimmering surface\r\nof the river, lighted now by the rising moon. A cricket chirped in the\r\nchimney-corner. A breeze stole through the screen door from the south\r\nladen with the odor of flowers.\r\n\r\nHe stood for five minutes without moving a muscle. She watched him with\r\nincreasing uneasiness, rose and slowly moved to his side.\r\n\r\n“Of what are you dreaming, my love-man?” she whispered.\r\n\r\nHis eyes remained fixed on the moonlit river.\r\n\r\n“Of you.”\r\n\r\nA warm soft hand found his and held it close.\r\n\r\nHe looked into her eyes intently.\r\n\r\n“Your friends are not coming,” he said.\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“You knew they were not?”\r\n\r\n“I knew.”\r\n\r\n“You think it’s all quite fair?”\r\n\r\n“They say that all is fair in love and war--were you thinking of\r\nyourself or of me?”\r\n\r\n“Of both--of you first.”\r\n\r\n“I am of age.”\r\n\r\n“I doubt if I am responsible to-night.”\r\n\r\n“I am.”\r\n\r\n“Whose cabin is this?” he asked suddenly.\r\n\r\n“Mine. I bought it last week.”\r\n\r\nShe felt his hand close on hers in a grip of cruel strength. She\r\nstrangled a little cry of pain.\r\n\r\nShe lifted her head in a movement of pride and spoke with even\r\ndeliberation.\r\n\r\n“Our position here to-night is an advance in morality--not a lapse. We\r\nseek the reality, not the shadow. We scorn the letter of an outgrown\r\nritualism. The murmur of the brook beneath our cabin is our wedding\r\nmarch----”\r\n\r\nShe paused and the soft music of the waters stole through the silence.\r\n\r\n“The mist of the fall is my bridal veil----”\r\n\r\nShe felt his trembling arm slowly circle her waist. He drew her close\r\nand their lips met.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n                              THE SECRET\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE first problem confronting the great adventure was the question of\r\npublicity. They discussed it seriously on the iron settee beside the\r\nfountain on Ellen’s roof Monday evening when they came in from dinner.\r\nThey had unconsciously stumbled on the crux of the marriage problem.\r\n\r\nEllen was emphatic in her views.\r\n\r\n“I loathe the idea of a public announcement of so intimate a personal\r\nthing as the union of two human beings in love. Why must our sisters\r\nand our cousins and our aunts and the great unwashed public break into\r\nthis, the sweetest and holiest hour of all life, with their grins and\r\njokes and cheap congratulations? What business is it of theirs? It’s\r\nour life, not theirs.”\r\n\r\n“True, dear love-woman,” he answered seriously, “and yet in a very\r\nreal sense, the record of the establishment of a family is the most\r\nimportant piece of book-keeping human society ever makes. If the family\r\nis the unit of civilization----”\r\n\r\n“But it’s not in the new civilized world in which modern woman proposes\r\nto live. We proclaim the era of universal democracy. We proclaim the\r\nadvent of woman as a conscious human being possessed of an individual\r\nsoul.”\r\n\r\n“All right; it’s nobody’s business then but ours.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not.”\r\n\r\n“Only, I’ve an old-fashioned hatred for sneaking and secrecy,” he\r\nadmitted.\r\n\r\n“You think that secrets are degrading?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve sometimes felt that way.”\r\n\r\n“Secrets are degrading only to shallow and untrained minds.”\r\n\r\nHe broke into a hearty laugh.\r\n\r\n“God knows, mine has been shallow at times and it’s yet untrained.”\r\n\r\n“Come, now, vain creature, don’t pin bouquets on your manly chest with\r\nyour left hand while you scorn them with your right! Your mind is not\r\nshallow and you know it. Your mind is trained and you know it. Your\r\nfeelings are simply the inheritance of centuries of foolish teaching.\r\nIt’s our business to teach the world the truth about our bodies and our\r\nsouls. Secrets are not degrading. I never lived as deeply or as keenly\r\nas I did the week I was preparing that little cabin for our honeymoon.\r\nDid you feel the contaminating influence of my deception?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” he fenced. “I felt two white round arms slipping about\r\nmy neck closer and closer until at last I couldn’t breathe!”\r\n\r\n“Which is precisely as God ordered it should be. You’re my man and I’m\r\nyour woman. My arms were made for your neck. Our secret makes life\r\ndramatic.”\r\n\r\n“Quite so,” he observed, “if my Big Boss Brown ever finds out that I\r\nhave won you----”\r\n\r\n“But you didn’t, dear boy, I won you.”\r\n\r\n“Well, have it your own way. If he ever finds out that you’re mine----”\r\n\r\n“But I’m not yours.”\r\n\r\n“No?”\r\n\r\n“No; I’m as free as a young eagle and so are you and so you’re going to\r\nbe to the end of life.”\r\n\r\n“All right, then. If he ever discovers that you’ve kidnapped me----”\r\n\r\n“Well, I like that!” she protested.\r\n\r\n“I’m trying to say it your way, anyhow, if he ever finds out our\r\nsecret, I’ll be looking for another job.”\r\n\r\n“Pish-tush!”\r\n\r\n“You know that he’s in love with you.”\r\n\r\n“Who cares?”\r\n\r\n“I’d like to give him notice to keep off the grass.”\r\n\r\n“You would, eh?”\r\n\r\n“Surest thing you know. It’s devilish awkward, such a secret.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll not announce our wedding.”\r\n\r\nHe seized and kissed her impulsively.\r\n\r\n“Let’s do it, sweetheart; let’s go right now and have the old-fashioned\r\nceremony just for the sake of our own peace of mind. I want to tell the\r\nworld you’re mine and I’m yours for time and eternity. Confound them\r\nall, I want ’em to know. I don’t want Brown making love to you again.\r\nI don’t want Field pecking on your wall or Bridges making calf-eyes at\r\nyou----”\r\n\r\n“Did a marriage ceremony ever stop that sort of love-making?” she\r\ninterrupted.\r\n\r\n“It will break it up for a while, anyhow, until the habit becomes\r\nfixed and that fixes life. Habit is character, honest to God it is.\r\nI want you to get the habit of utterly loving me without the thought\r\nof another man. Then it’ll come easy and the habit will stick. I want\r\nto get in the habit of loving you with utter devotion. When I get the\r\nhabit it’ll stick for life--I’ll go on about my work and not know that\r\nanother woman lives.”\r\n\r\n“Rubbish, man, if you want another woman I’ll not want you.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t honestly say as much,” he protested. “I want you with a\r\npassion that hurts and I’d come pretty near wringing the neck of any\r\nman who dares to make eyes at you now.”\r\n\r\n“Jealousy’s the most degrading of all human passions. I’ll never stoop\r\nto it,” she broke in dreamily.\r\n\r\n“Well, I may. I’m just common clay when it comes to that, and I’ve a\r\npretty strong idea that I’d fight for my woman.”\r\n\r\n“Listen to the Big Chief again--‘My Woman!’ Haven’t I told you that I’m\r\nnot _yours_? That you’re not _mine_?”\r\n\r\n“Theoretically, yes,” he admitted. “But, by the Lord, you _are_\r\njust the same and you know it.”\r\n\r\nHe drew her to his heart with passionate tenderness and smothered her\r\nprotests with kisses, until she lay in his arms without a struggle.\r\n\r\n“A secret, then, it shall be, if you wish it, dear love-woman,” he said\r\nat last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n                               PROGRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEY were on the way to the Eagle’s Nest to celebrate the first\r\nanniversary of their union by the new free ceremony of the waterfalls\r\nwhen it happened--the discovery of their secret.\r\n\r\nLucy Sheldon had not suspected the truth. She had mildly reproached\r\nher nephew for his slow love-making. She had broadly hinted to Ellen\r\nher opinion of a woman who dallied so long with a man and never landed\r\nthe game, but the self-poised young leader of the new revolution never\r\nbatted an eye. The subject was dismissed without discussion.\r\n\r\nIt was at Manning’s urgent request she had not made his aunt a\r\nconfidant. He knew with instinctive dread that such a revelation would\r\nbring an estrangement beyond repair. He loved her devotedly and shrank\r\nfrom facing her over such an issue. It would be cowardly to plead that\r\nhe was not responsible. By the old code man is always responsible. The\r\nsimplest thing was to keep a close mouth with Lucy Sheldon. This they\r\nhad carefully done.\r\n\r\nThe drive had been delightful. A thousand tender memories crowded\r\neach turn of the beautiful road. The year had been an inspiring one\r\nfor Ellen and yet she had completely lost her impulse to creative\r\nthinking. Her happiness was so deep, so full, so soul-absorbing it had\r\nbeen impossible to do serious work. She had basked in the sun. She had\r\nstrolled in the parks and listened to the chirp of birds and watched\r\nwith lazy joy the foolishness of young lovers. Her work was a farce.\r\n\r\n“What a wonderful year it has been, dear man!” she exclaimed after a\r\nlong silence.\r\n\r\n“Wonderful.”\r\n\r\n“Have you any regrets?”\r\n\r\n“Only that the year had so few days in it!”\r\n\r\n“That can be remedied--we’ll enlarge the calendar by adding another,\r\nshall we not?”\r\n\r\n“And another.”\r\n\r\n“And another!”\r\n\r\n“Keep your hand off this wheel while I’m driving!” she sternly\r\ncommanded while the blood rushed in waves to her beautiful face.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t touch you!” he declared.\r\n\r\n“No, but you were going to if I hadn’t stopped you.”\r\n\r\n“Let’s take a cup of tea at Bear Mountain--we stopped there a minute\r\non that first drive--don’t you remember?”\r\n\r\n“And watched the droves of silly lovers pour across the road. All\r\nright, we’ll stop.”\r\n\r\nShe swung the little roadster into line with the cars in the\r\nreservation for motor vehicles and they walked up to the restaurant.\r\n\r\nThe usual Saturday crowd thronged the place. Most of the seats were\r\ntaken, but they found a table at last beside the windows overlooking\r\nthe river. And as luck would have it they could talk without fear of\r\nbeing overheard. A family party had annexed the tables nearby and their\r\nnoisy chatter gave the solitude they wished. “Aren’t you happy, my\r\nlove-man?” she asked tenderly.\r\n\r\n“As a grinning idiot,” he laughed.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you begin to see now that marriage is merely the established\r\nlegal bond between the owner and the bought, the keeper and the kept?”\r\n\r\n“Whatever you say goes,” he parried.\r\n\r\n“But don’t you see it and feel it as I do now?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose I must. If I got any more joy out of the old-fashioned\r\nmarriage I would be reduced to a state of idiocy.”\r\n\r\nHe didn’t try to argue. She was doing it for both and he saw it\r\nclearly. Her mind was busy summing up the year’s joys and the spell\r\ncould not be broken. Her tones were a half-dreaming, half-waking\r\necstacy.\r\n\r\n“I hated submission, and now that I know I’m free, I love to submit to\r\nyour will, don’t I?”\r\n\r\nHe nodded approval.\r\n\r\n“I said I’d be your comrade and companion or nothing. I’ve proven that\r\nit’s possible, haven’t I?”\r\n\r\n“You have.”\r\n\r\n“The moment I had been your slave this would not have been possible,\r\nnow would it?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not!”\r\n\r\n“A womanhood free, strong, tender, fearless----”\r\n\r\nShe paused and flushed scarlet. Her eyes were fixed in a speechless\r\nstare across the crowded room.\r\n\r\nManning turned quickly and saw Edwin Brown approaching their table, a\r\nbroad smile on his handsome face.\r\n\r\nHis heart gave a thump and he felt it was going to stop. He knew\r\nthat Brown had been really in love with Ellen. He had dreaded to\r\nface the day of his discovery of their relations. It might open ugly\r\npossibilities in more ways than one. If he should be vindictive, he\r\ncould smash his career at a blow. If he turned out to be the scoundrel\r\nthe world believed him, his determination to win her might be more grim\r\nthan ever, and his methods without a scruple. Perhaps Brown wouldn’t\r\nleap at conclusions after all.\r\n\r\nBut Manning didn’t like the curious smile that played about the corners\r\nof his expressive mouth as he came nearer. He liked still less the mask\r\nthat followed the smile as he reached their table.\r\n\r\nHe rose to greet him and met the extended hand with casual politeness.\r\n\r\n“Sit down, governor, and have a bite, won’t you?” he said politely.\r\n\r\n“Yes, do,” Ellen urged.\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” he answered, promptly taking the proffered seat.\r\n\r\nHe held Ellen’s gaze for an instant and she blushed.\r\n\r\n“Well, children,” he began gravely, “I’ve certainly caught you----”\r\n\r\n“Really!” Ellen exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Surest thing you know,” he went on half-humorously, half-seriously. “I\r\ncaught a glimpse of that little roadster twice before on this drive to\r\nBear Mountain, caught a glimpse of the woman in the case, but couldn’t\r\nmake out the man--well, well, well!”\r\n\r\nHe folded his arms and surveyed the pair.\r\n\r\nManning flushed and moved uneasily.\r\n\r\nEllen laughed outright.\r\n\r\n“I suppose you’ll report us to the grand jury?” she asked in mock fear.\r\n\r\n“It’s probably my duty as a law-abiding citizen--but I hate duties.”\r\n\r\nHe paused and smiled curiously at Ellen.\r\n\r\nManning’s blood began to boil.\r\n\r\n“So this is why I haven’t had a ghost of a chance the past year, eh?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Couldn’t even get a telephone message through to you--well, well;\r\nwhat’s the use of a man having money if it don’t get what he wants!”\r\n\r\n“It will be distressing if woman ever emerges from the age of barter\r\nand sale, won’t it?” Ellen broke in.\r\n\r\nHe ignored the interruption.\r\n\r\n“You know, you’re the first woman who ever threw me flat, without even\r\na passing ‘excuse me’ as you walked over my prostrate form.”\r\n\r\n“And I’m not to be forgiven?”\r\n\r\n“On the other hand, my admiration has increased. I’ll get over the\r\nhurt. Men of my egotistical make-up always recover--but tell me\r\nsomething----”\r\n\r\nHe stopped short and searched Ellen’s eyes.\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“You look radiant; more beautiful than ever.”\r\n\r\nManning stirred uneasily.\r\n\r\n“Keep still, young man,” he growled. “You’re more beautiful than ever,”\r\nhe went on, “but you’ve written very little the past year--why?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve been too happy, I suppose,” was the frank confession.\r\n\r\n“That’s it, beyond a doubt,” he mused. “And the funny thing is that\r\nit’s the contradiction of all your pet theories of self-development!”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!” she protested.\r\n\r\n“It certainly is,” he affirmed. “By every article of your creed your\r\nmind should be blossoming as your radiant body. You have attained\r\nwoman’s supreme dream--the love of the man you love--and instead of\r\nwriting a great book, you’ve stopped work!”\r\n\r\n“I’ve a right to my year of jubilee!”\r\n\r\n“Granted, but look at this youngster by your side.”\r\n\r\nManning’s heart gave another thump, but he faced his superior boldly.\r\n\r\n“And what of him?” Ellen asked in low tones.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he continued musingly, “my managing editor has been telling\r\nme for some time that he’s doing the best work of his life. He has\r\nrecommended him for city editor. A rank amateur for such a job, but\r\nI’ve a notion to take a chance. Can’t help a friendly interest in two\r\ncheerful idiots who have set out on so perilous a journey----”\r\n\r\nHe paused and laid his hand on Manning’s arm.\r\n\r\n“You can go on Monday morning, son; your salary’s ten thousand a year!”\r\n\r\nHe rose and extended his hand to Ellen.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye and good luck!”\r\n\r\nManning pushed his chair aside, sprang to his feet and grasped Brown’s\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n“I can’t tell you how much I appreciate it, sir; I can’t thank you!”\r\n\r\n“You don’t need to. You’ve earned your promotion. You’re worth every\r\ndollar of your salary to my paper, or you wouldn’t get it.”\r\n\r\nWith a wave of his long arm and a smile he was gone.\r\n\r\n“By Jove, that’s great!” Manning whispered; “isn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“Wonderful,” she responded abstractedly.\r\n\r\n“I was scared one minute and ready to choke him the next when he was\r\ndevouring you with his eyes, but, by George, he got my goat! To think\r\nof his doing this on the spur of the minute.”\r\n\r\nHe stopped and thought.\r\n\r\n“And it was on the level. It was a square business proposition. He\r\nknows you too well to have any sinister purpose in the back of his\r\nhead.”\r\n\r\nHe looked at Ellen and caught the expression of brooding antagonism.\r\n\r\n“For heaven’s sake, what’s the matter?” he asked nervously.\r\n\r\n“Nothing.”\r\n\r\nIt was past the ken of mere man to know that she had felt the first\r\npang of jealousy as his rival in the world’s work. He had passed her\r\non the road to fame and fortune. His salary was nearly double the one\r\nshe was receiving. Hers would probably remain at six thousand for the\r\nnext ten years. There was hardly a limit to the possibilities of his\r\nadvancement in the next decade.\r\n\r\nShe lay awake for hours that night in the cabin on the cliff brooding\r\nover the sinister suggestions which her foolish jealousy had roused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n                              THE QUARREL\r\n\r\n\r\nELLEN West had quickly recovered from her mood of jealous rivalry. She\r\ntried to make up for the ugly thought by unusual tenderness toward\r\nManning.\r\n\r\n“I’m glad! Of course I am,” she repeated. “I want him to be the biggest\r\nforce in New York’s intellectual life--to climb to the very top, and\r\nI’ll help him do it!”\r\n\r\nIn spite of her generous resolutions and stern adherence to them the\r\nhurt was there. Deep down she found it festering. It was unreasonable\r\nthat a boy with only two years’ experience in New York should leap\r\nsuddenly ahead of her at a single bound. It was unfair. It was part of\r\nthe old régime of the dual standard of morals and the dual standard of\r\nunequal pay for equal work. The revolution she was leading would also\r\nright this wrong.\r\n\r\nAnd yet when she faced the truth she knew that her salary was as large\r\nas the position could pay. A magazine of revolutionary ideas could not\r\ncommand millions of readers. The moment it could do so, its work would\r\nbe done. The man who could hold down the job of city editor of a great\r\nmorning daily was worth ten thousand a year to the enterprise. There\r\nwas nothing unfair or unreasonable about it. It was simply a question\r\nof brains and the capacity for unlimited work.\r\n\r\nShe braced herself for the celebration of Manning’s promotion, which\r\nBrown had planned at his country place on Long Island.\r\n\r\nMore than a hundred people had been invited to spend the week-end as\r\nhis guests. It was the first social function which she had consented\r\nto attend since her union with Manning. It was, in fact, one of the\r\nfew where it would have been possible for both to be present without\r\nquestion or embarrassment.\r\n\r\nBrown’s mother was eighty years old, a fine specimen of the old-school\r\nsociety leader. She worshipped her handsome bachelor son and while she\r\nnominally presided over his home, his word was the only law she wished\r\nto know. His list of guests she invited without question. She knew that\r\nhe loved her too tenderly to wound her pride with an invitation which\r\nwould cause unpleasant comment. Had he done so, she was a woman of too\r\nstrong a character to have even winced at his mistake.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact the guests Brown had selected were beyond\r\nsuspicion--artists, men of letters, editors and newspaper owners,\r\ntheir wives, daughters, sisters and cousins. It was quite unnecessary\r\nto explain an invitation to Ellen West. She was the most noted woman\r\neditor in America.\r\n\r\nOne little personal attention to her comfort and happiness Brown\r\ngave with the utmost care that no one should discover his purpose.\r\nHe sincerely admired the daring of the young feminist leader, though\r\nskeptical of the ultimate outcome of her experiment. Every male\r\nmaterialist and every conservative woman would naturally be a skeptic\r\non such an issue. But Brown was fair. He would give her the benefit of\r\nthe doubt. In the meantime, he would see to it that she was happy in\r\nthis first visit to the magnificent estate which would have been her\r\nown had she accepted his offer.\r\n\r\nHe gave his personal attention to the assignment of the rooms to each\r\nguest.\r\n\r\n“I’ll attend to it myself, mother,” he said lightly. “It will test the\r\ncapacity of the house this time--more than a hundred, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense, Edwin,” she replied. “We don’t keep a house. We keep a\r\nhotel. It will be very strange if we can’t make a hundred people\r\ncomfortable in seventy-five rooms.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I’ll store them all snugly away, never fear.”\r\n\r\nHe made out the list and assigned each guest to their rooms with his\r\nown hand. The fine suite on the south-east corner with its windows\r\noverlooking the Sound both south and east he selected for Ellen West.\r\n\r\n“We’ll have to divide all the suites,” he said to the housekeeper.\r\n\r\nHe gave the large corner room to Ellen and assigned the next room to\r\nManning. He closed the communicating door, locked and bolted it. And\r\njust before the guests began to arrive he entered the suite, slipped\r\nthe bolt, unlocked the door, removed the key and put it in his pocket.\r\n\r\n“Bless their dear foolish hearts,” he said; “it would be cruel to\r\nseparate them on a festival day for her lover!”\r\n\r\nEllen was quick to catch the significance of their assignment.\r\n\r\nShe heard Manning whistling in the next room and tried the knob on the\r\ncommunicating door. She was absolutely sure it was not locked and yet\r\nwhen it opened at her touch and she walked into Manning’s room she\r\nlaughed immoderately.\r\n\r\nManning turned with a quick look of surprise and joined in the laugh.\r\n\r\n“This is what I call ‘all the comforts of home’!” she cried, “without\r\nany of its annoying cares!”\r\n\r\nHe glanced at the window overlooking the garden, saw the men at work\r\namong the flowers and quickly drew the shades.\r\n\r\n“Do you suppose the Big Boss did that on purpose?” Manning asked.\r\n\r\n“Of course.”\r\n\r\n“Thoughtful of him, wasn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“Very.”\r\n\r\n“Almost too thoughtful, come to think of it.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” she inquired protestingly.\r\n\r\n“You don’t suppose he’ll be discussing our affairs with his guests, do\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“Impossible.”\r\n\r\n“Pretty plain announcement that he understands the situation.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t suppose, dear boy, that we could fool a man of his knowledge\r\nof the world?”\r\n\r\n“I’m glad somebody knows it, aren’t you?”\r\n\r\n“No. It’s nobody’s business.”\r\n\r\n“Still, you can’t live and die absolutely to yourself, now can you?”\r\n\r\nShe looked at him a minute with searching question.\r\n\r\n“Been getting restless in our little world for the past years, my\r\nconquering man?”\r\n\r\nHe flushed and answered quickly:\r\n\r\n“You know I haven’t.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve sometimes wondered,” she mused.\r\n\r\n“You’ve kept your wondering very quiet,” he observed.\r\n\r\n“Well, you’ll be the lion here to-night,” she went on briskly. “I’ll\r\nhave to keep my distance, I suppose, and admire from afar.”\r\n\r\n“If you do,” he said impulsively, “I’ll walk right up and kiss you\r\nbefore the crowd.”\r\n\r\nHer eyes brightened.\r\n\r\n“Would you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. And I’ll do it, too, if you begin any funny business here with me\r\nto-night in this mob. I hate crowds anyhow.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll be the soul of discretion, never fear,” she answered banteringly.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the effort to appear at ease during the games of the\r\nafternoon they were both conscious of the dramatic situation which\r\nBrown’s keen eyes enjoyed.\r\n\r\nThe instant Ellen appeared on the broad porch she was surrounded by a\r\ngroup of women admirers. Manning followed a half-hour later. She was\r\nannoyed at first by his delay. And yet the longer he stayed, the more\r\nembarrassing she felt that his appearance would be if they attempted to\r\nremain together in such a crowd.\r\n\r\nShe sighed with relief when Brown introduced him immediately to a\r\nlot of pretty girls. Her relief gave way to anger as she threw an\r\noccasional glance in the direction of his group.\r\n\r\nHe had evidently been relieved by Brown’s tact and appeared to be\r\ndecidedly enjoying himself. She despised herself for such vulgar\r\njealousy only to look again with increasing anger.\r\n\r\nHe was holding a regular levee. Every pretty girl on the place was\r\npressing forward to greet the lion of the occasion. The thing that\r\nparticularly annoyed her was that three or four angling match-making\r\nmothers were hanging over him after they had dangled the bait of\r\ntheir pretty daughters before his eyes. They were pressing him with\r\ninvitations to call, for teas, dinners, receptions and theatre parties,\r\nof course.\r\n\r\nShe dropped the discussion which she was holding with two of the\r\ndirectors of the magazine and walked straight into the circle of girls\r\nand scheming mothers. Her face was flushed and her eyes sparkled. She\r\nhad pressed her way through the crowd before she realized her foolish\r\nmistake. But it was impossible to retreat.\r\n\r\nShe extended her hand while she was stammering and making excuses to a\r\nfat mother whose plump offspring smiled enticingly.\r\n\r\n“May I offer my congratulations also among the first, Mr. Manning?”\r\n\r\nHis jaw dropped and the perspiration started in tiny beads on his\r\nforehead, while his face flushed scarlet.\r\n\r\nThe fat mother stared and the smile died on the dimpled daughter.\r\nThere was an accent of authority in her tones that chilled general\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nHe took her hand mechanically and stammered an incoherent reply. The\r\nfat mother nodded a friendly good-bye and the smiling daughter faded\r\naway.\r\n\r\n“For the love of God,” he groaned under his breath, “get me out of\r\nthis.”\r\n\r\n“You’re enjoying it,” she replied in low tones.\r\n\r\n“I’m in hell,” he gasped. “They push and crowd and press on me. Lord,\r\nthere comes Brown with another dozen; save me, for God’s sake, save me!”\r\n\r\nHis distress was so genuine, his desire to escape so sincere, her heart\r\nsmote her for making the scene. At least no one present understood its\r\nmeaning. She was thankful for that.\r\n\r\nShe pressed his hand gently and whispered:\r\n\r\n“Forgive me, dearest, I couldn’t help it. I’ll not be silly again.”\r\n\r\nShe had quite regained her composure when Brown appeared with the\r\nsecond bevy of girls.\r\n\r\nShe searched his face for a trace of malice and found only the smiling\r\nmask of the host bent on giving the utmost of himself to his guests.\r\n\r\nShe nodded a friendly challenge. He caught her subtle meaning,\r\nintroduced the girls and followed her into the flower garden, where she\r\nfound a seat in the shadow of a rose trellis.\r\n\r\n“You’re not jealous?” he laughed.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“You needn’t be--there’s not an ounce of brains in the whole crowd.”\r\n\r\n“But some remarkably pretty faces.”\r\n\r\n“I thought jealousy was forbidden by your creed?”\r\n\r\n“It is.”\r\n\r\n“You have fallen from grace?”\r\n\r\n“I have.”\r\n\r\n“You underestimate your powers, dear lady,” he reassured her. “Your man\r\nis sweating blood.”\r\n\r\n“He’ll survive.”\r\n\r\n“I really hated to torture him. But I had to do it.”\r\n\r\n“I understand.”\r\n\r\n“I tried to make you two silly people happy.”\r\n\r\n“You personally arranged that suite?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n\r\n“No one else knows?”\r\n\r\n“Stole the keys myself.”\r\n\r\n“It was very sweet of you.”\r\n\r\n“Cost me a pang or two, dear lady.”\r\n\r\n“You’re bearing up bravely.”\r\n\r\nHe looked at her seriously.\r\n\r\n“What else could I do, but play the rôle of a Brownie godfather to two\r\nwilful children? I assure you that your happiness is a thing I deeply\r\ndesire.”\r\n\r\n“Did you promote my man because you once made love to me?”\r\n\r\n“Honestly, no.”\r\n\r\n“I had hoped it might be so.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Just a little jealous of my sweetheart’s big success, I think.”\r\n\r\n“Impossible. You don’t do yourself justice.”\r\n\r\n“It’s true. You forget that when a woman demands her position of\r\nequality with man she may become his rival.”\r\n\r\n“That is a fact, isn’t it?” he mused.\r\n\r\n“I’m ashamed of it, but it’s true.”\r\n\r\nHe stooped and picked a pebble from the walkway. His eyes were bent on\r\nthe ground while he spoke.\r\n\r\n“You are happy?”\r\n\r\n“As happy as any woman can be.”\r\n\r\nHe watched her narrowly out of the corners of his clear steel eyes.\r\n\r\n“All right. I just want you to always remember that the best wish of my\r\nheart is for your real happiness even if I have to find it in giving\r\nyou to my rival.”\r\n\r\nEllen placed her hand on his.\r\n\r\n“You’re a good fellow, Edwin,” she responded earnestly. “I’ll not\r\nforget that little speech----”\r\n\r\nShe paused at the sound of a footstep, lifted her eyes and saw Manning\r\nstare angrily at the scene.\r\n\r\nBrown rose without embarrassment and waved to him.\r\n\r\n“Take my seat, my boy, and have a quiet hour here removed from the mob.\r\nI was just having a heart-to-heart talk to your sweetheart about you.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks,” Manning answered.\r\n\r\nThe tones in which his employer had spoken were so honest, so\r\nstraightforward, so reassuring, he cast out instantly his suspicions.\r\nBut he had his own idea about Ellen’s part in the incident.\r\n\r\nHe fixed her with a searching gaze.\r\n\r\n“You took Brown out here deliberately to flirt with him?”\r\n\r\nHis jealousy made her unreasonably happy.\r\n\r\n“Why shouldn’t I, if I felt the impulse?”\r\n\r\n“You’re free, of course.”\r\n\r\n“And I expect to remain free.”\r\n\r\n“So do I.”\r\n\r\nShe glared at him.\r\n\r\n“Mind you don’t go too far, sir!”\r\n\r\n“How could I help them crowding around me?”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t say you could.”\r\n\r\n“You imply as much!”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t say you could help their crowding around you, but I must say\r\nyou took the assault quite philosophically.”\r\n\r\n“What would you have me do?”\r\n\r\n“You didn’t have to make calf eyes at the poor young things.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t make calf eyes at ’em!”\r\n\r\n“I saw you.”\r\n\r\n“It’s not true and you know it.”\r\n\r\n“And you know that I didn’t lure Brown out here to flirt with him.”\r\n\r\n“You have a perfect right to flirt as much as you please, I suppose.”\r\n\r\n“And you have a perfect right to make calf eyes at pretty girls if you\r\nfeel the impulse.”\r\n\r\n“Why quarrel, then?”\r\n\r\n“I’m not; you picked this quarrel.”\r\n\r\n“Well of all the cheek! I was sitting here in the most innocent little\r\nchat with my host----”\r\n\r\n“With one hand pressing his.”\r\n\r\n“You were watching us?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“I’m glad you saw it----”\r\n\r\n“I’m glad you saw me making calf eyes at those girls----”\r\n\r\n“You admit it, then?”\r\n\r\n“For the sake of hurting you, yes!”\r\n\r\nShe rose with a movement of anger and he seized her hand.\r\n\r\n“Don’t go, dear; I’m sorry, and I’m miserable.”\r\n\r\nShe sat down again and smiled.\r\n\r\n“Are you?”\r\n\r\n“Utterly miserable.”\r\n\r\n“I’m glad.”\r\n\r\n“Let’s not quarrel!”\r\n\r\n“Shall we kiss and make up?” she asked archly.\r\n\r\nHe pressed her hand and bent toward her lips, but stopped short at the\r\nsight of Field. He was rapidly approaching the little bower evidently\r\nlooking for them.\r\n\r\n“Confound him!” Manning hissed. “There’s another old sweetheart coming\r\nto try his luck again!”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be foolish, boy,” she whispered, returning the pressure of his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nField was under the trellis, bowing gracefully.\r\n\r\n“Congratulations to you both, my children!” he heartily called from the\r\ndoorway. “I’m glad to find you together.”\r\n\r\n“Won’t you sit down?” Manning responded.\r\n\r\n“No, no, keep your seat, boy. You’re the king here to-day. You know\r\nthat I was in love with Ellen. She couldn’t see me with a spyglass. I’m\r\nglad you won. You’re a real man. You don’t know how hard hit I was.”\r\n\r\nEllen frowned.\r\n\r\n“Honest injun; I’ve been away for a year, haven’t I?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; you went to Japan to write a book.”\r\n\r\n“My excuse, children. I ran away because I was crossed in love.”\r\n\r\nManning and Ellen joined in a laugh.\r\n\r\n“And all the sympathy I get is a sneer from the happy couple who are\r\ncamping on the grave of my affections.”\r\n\r\nField rattled on for half an hour keeping up the pretense of his\r\ncrushed heart until Manning grew tired of it. Through his banter he\r\nfelt the keen cold nose of the hunter searching for game. It made him\r\nfurious to think that this polished materialist was perhaps the only\r\nman next to Brown who knew the truth of his relations to Ellen and that\r\nhe was deliberately trying to take advantage of it now to air his stale\r\nwit.\r\n\r\nHe was growing angrier and more miserable by the minute. Ellen felt it\r\ninstinctively and said finally:\r\n\r\n“Do run along, Randy, I’m tired of your twaddle. I’ve got something\r\nimportant to say to my man.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I must say,” Field muttered, “that in the art of gentle hinting\r\nyou’re a past mistress, Ellen. But I forgive you. Bye-bye, children.\r\nAnd listen, fair leader of woman, keep your eye on the anglers at the\r\nball to-night. They’ll try to land him under your very nose!”\r\n\r\n“Go away, Randy!” Ellen commanded.\r\n\r\n“I’ve taken the hint; I go; see you both later.”\r\n\r\n“Let’s go home!” Ellen exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“I wish we could,” he responded.\r\n\r\n“Pack your grip; I’ll follow in an hour.”\r\n\r\nHe shook his head.\r\n\r\n“It’s impossible.”\r\n\r\n“The thing’s given in my honor. Brown would never forgive such an\r\ninsult.”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“We’ve got to stick it out,” he concluded gloomily.\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Promise me one thing, then,” she begged.\r\n\r\n“Cut as much of that idiotic dancing as you can.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll cut it all out.”\r\n\r\n“You can’t.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose not. Confound it, why did I ever agree to come anyhow.”\r\n\r\n“And why did I?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll hurry back now and find Brown for some more grinning, and bowing\r\nand polite lying.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, go; we’ve been here too long.”\r\n\r\nHe left her brooding in moody silence and they met but a moment in\r\ntheir suite before dinner.\r\n\r\nShe slipped her arms around his neck and gave way to the first tears\r\nshe had shed since their union.\r\n\r\nHe soothed her in silence, stroking the brown hair tenderly.\r\n\r\n“I’m miserable, dear love-man!” she sighed.\r\n\r\n“So am I, my love-woman! We’ll cut this sort of thing out of our life,\r\nwon’t we?”\r\n\r\n“We will.”\r\n\r\nThe ball was the climax of her misery. There was no such thing as\r\nescape for Manning. The pretty girls overwhelmed him and their mothers\r\nadded tenfold to his troubles.\r\n\r\nEllen watched the rush to ensnare him with impotent rage. Twice she\r\nleft the ballroom in sheer disgust and went to her own room determined\r\nto go to bed and try to sleep. Each time she returned to the scene of\r\nher humiliation, drawn by an irresistible spell.\r\n\r\nThe attack on Manning was continuous. They fired in platoons and\r\nsingle-handed. They outnumbered him and surrounded him if he dared try\r\nto escape. It was past twelve o’clock and he had ceased to struggle. He\r\nwas the most accomplished and graceful dancer in the room. Ellen was\r\nsurprised and hurt to learn it. She didn’t dance. She didn’t care to\r\nwaste her time. She envied the giggling, pretty ones to-night. They\r\nsmiled unutterable things into the face of her man with an audacity\r\nthat was disgusting. How could women be so shameless in their bid for a\r\nman!\r\n\r\nAs they swept by her in the whirl of a waltz she caught Manning\r\nanswering his partner with a smile of more gaiety than conventional\r\npoliteness required. She was an unusually beautiful girl of\r\ntwenty-one--willowy, graceful, intelligent--with the same eyes and hair\r\nas her own.\r\n\r\nUnable to endure the scene another moment she left the place abruptly,\r\nwent to her room, undressed and went to bed.\r\n\r\nBefore throwing the switch of the electric light she deliberately\r\nbolted the door communicating with Manning’s room. An hour later she\r\nlay with wide-staring eyes reviewing the maze of her tangled life.\r\n\r\nShe heard his gentle rap on the door and he softly tried the knob. Half\r\nan hour later he knocked again. She didn’t wish to see him. Through the\r\nlong hours of the night she tossed wide-awake and miserable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n                             THE AFTERMATH\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE one tantalizing thing that had kept Ellen awake destroyed\r\ncompletely her peace of mind and killed for the moment even the desire\r\nfor her lover was the fear of future quarrels.\r\n\r\nShe got the first vivid pictures of what freedom might mean for a man.\r\nManning had struggled fairly well against the flood of sex allurement\r\ninto which designing women had sought to overwhelm him to-night. He\r\nwould probably struggle again. His sense of humor was keen. His sense\r\nof loyalty was even keener.\r\n\r\nBut could any man withstand the continuous challenge with which girls\r\nwho wished to win could pound him?\r\n\r\nThe trouble was women were yet in the zoölogical period of development.\r\nThey couldn’t and they wouldn’t keep their eyes off her man. Being free\r\nhe was fair game.\r\n\r\nIt was equally true that men would not keep their eyes off her. She had\r\nresented Manning’s accusation of an attempt to flirt with Brown, yet in\r\nher heart she knew that Brown had been drawn to her by a resistless\r\ndesire to test the depth and sincerity of her love for Manning. Beneath\r\nthe friendly and always polite solicitude of the host she felt the nose\r\nof the hunter. It irritated yet flattered her vanity. It irritated\r\nher to think that men should hold her so shallow and changeable. It\r\nflattered her to feel that in spite of her union with Manning, a man of\r\nBrown’s position, power and strength of character found it worth while\r\nto follow her. It went without saying that Field would never give up\r\nthe chase so long as she held him at bay.\r\n\r\nWith a little pang she recalled at daylight her refusals to admit\r\nManning to her room. She wondered vaguely what he would say and just\r\nhow he would take it.\r\n\r\nShe fell asleep at last from sheer exhaustion and slept until noon. She\r\nsprang from bed, glanced at the clock and listened for a sound from\r\nManning. Not a movement could be heard. A flood of bitter regret at\r\nher rebuff overwhelmed her. She would make up for it. Married people\r\nquarrelled and made up. They were married in the truest and deepest\r\nsense. They were bound by love alone. What a fool she had been to allow\r\nanger and jealousy to make them both miserable.\r\n\r\nShe tiptoed to his door, softly slipped the bolt and turned the knob.\r\nThe door was fast! He had thrown the bolt on his side.\r\n\r\nShe laughed at first and tapped gently.\r\n\r\n“Served me right!” she muttered.\r\n\r\nShe knocked again and listened. Still not a sound. She knocked more\r\ndistinctly.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry, love-man!” she called plaintively.\r\n\r\nFor ten minutes she stood and listened. He had, of course, risen early\r\nand gone to his breakfast.\r\n\r\nA sickening fear began to grow in her heart. She had treated him\r\noutrageously. She had no right to expect him to forget it instantly.\r\nYet why shouldn’t she bolt her door against a husband if she liked?\r\nOld-fashioned marriage forbade such rights to a wife. But she was not\r\nan old-fashioned wife and never intended to be one. He was trying to\r\nbully her. Well, she would show him that two people could play that\r\ngame!\r\n\r\nShe dressed hastily and hurried down to breakfast. The dining-room was\r\ncrowded with guests equally late. Manning was nowhere to be seen.\r\n\r\nShe ate her breakfast in silence. She longed to see Lucy Sheldon. She\r\nwondered vaguely if her transfer to Holt’s Chicago paper had anything\r\nto do with her relations to Manning. The idea was impossible. Lucy\r\nSheldon was too frank to have run away to avoid such an issue. And\r\nyet if Manning had told his aunt the truth, that he had yielded to\r\nher imperious demand for a marriage of her own making, she might have\r\naccepted the Chicago opening with its larger salary to avoid the pain\r\nof a discussion.\r\n\r\nThe thought angered and worried her this morning beyond measure. It\r\nhad never occurred to her before. The more she thought of it, the more\r\ncertain became the conviction that her friend knew and left New York to\r\navoid her. She would find Manning at once and ask him.\r\n\r\nA sense of bitter loneliness choked her. She couldn’t finish her\r\nbreakfast. She stopped abruptly, left the table, and began her search\r\nover the spacious and beautiful grounds. She walked through the garden\r\nin vain. Here and there a young couple sat spooning, but nowhere the\r\nfamiliar tall figure.\r\n\r\nThese young fools spooning at the noon hour angered her still more. She\r\nleft the garden in disgust, strolled along the water’s edge and scanned\r\nthe boats. A half dozen couples were rowing close in shore.\r\n\r\nHe was not among them. She sat down in the little boat-house on the\r\npier utterly depressed. He was avoiding her, of course. He was as\r\nsensitive as he was stubborn. She made up her mind finally that he\r\ncould go to the devil. He could look for her from now on.\r\n\r\nShe had just reached this state of perfect unhappiness when Brown\r\nsuddenly stood before her, tipped his hat and said:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Manning received a telephone call from the office this morning\r\nthat took him to town on the eight o’clock train----”\r\n\r\nHe paused and watched the blood slowly mount to her cheeks.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid you quarrelled,” he added gravely.\r\n\r\n“You’re a keen observer.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I couldn’t help wondering how any man could leave you at such an\r\nunearthly hour.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose he had to go.”\r\n\r\n“He did not.”\r\n\r\n“You saw him this morning?”\r\n\r\n“No, the butler told me.”\r\n\r\nA silence followed.\r\n\r\n“You did quarrel?” he persisted.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“About me?”\r\n\r\nEllen laughed.\r\n\r\n“Vanity of vanities--all is vanity, saith the preacher!”\r\n\r\n“No?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“About what, then?”\r\n\r\n“About these pretty girls who did their best to steal my man away from\r\nme last night. Did you bring them here for that purpose?”\r\n\r\nIt was Brown’s turn to laugh and he did it heartily.\r\n\r\n“That would have been a neat revenge on you, wouldn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“Very.”\r\n\r\n“I assure you the thought never entered the back of my head.”\r\n\r\n“I never saw so many pretty girls in one spot in my life.”\r\n\r\n“Really?”\r\n\r\n“And I never saw them so unanimously bent on one thing before.”\r\n\r\nShe stopped and deliberately brushed a tear from her cheek.\r\n\r\n“You’re an interesting study,” he observed drily.\r\n\r\n“I’m anything but interesting to myself just now. Do you wish to be\r\nvery nice to me in my misery?”\r\n\r\n“Always.”\r\n\r\n“Will you send me home in one of your cars?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly. May I go with you?”\r\n\r\n“I prefer to be alone.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” he agreed lightly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “YOU’RE AN INTERESTING STUDY.”]\r\n\r\nThe day was one of rare beauty in late September--a perfect sky of\r\ndeepest azure flecked with white clouds. The sun shone in dazzling\r\nsplendor, lighting the purple-tipped leaves of the trees with tints of\r\nunusual depth. The beauty of the drive only made the ache in her heart\r\nthe more hopeless.\r\n\r\n“It was cruel and cowardly,” she muttered; “cruel and cowardly!”\r\n\r\nShe knew that she was to blame and that made it the harder to bear.\r\nShe would tell him what she thought of him now in words he would not\r\nforget--and then make up and love him to death!\r\n\r\nIt was three o’clock before she reached home. She called his apartment.\r\nHe was not there. She called his club. He was not there. She didn’t\r\nbelieve he was at the office at this hour, but she called it.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Mr. Manning is here, but he cannot be disturbed.”\r\n\r\n“Connect me!”\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, please----”\r\n\r\nThe connection was broken! She rang up the managing editor. He was not\r\nin. She tried three times to get Manning and quit in rage.\r\n\r\nShe made up her mind once for all that she would die sooner than call\r\nhim again. If there were any more telephone calls he could ring her up!\r\n\r\nShe waited three days in vain. It was incredible that he could be so\r\nsullen and vindictive. She reviewed the miserable dinner party in\r\nminute detail. She hated the memory of it--the eager ravenous eyes of\r\nthose matchmaking mothers fastened on her lover! She resented the fact\r\nwithout the ability to realize their point of view.\r\n\r\n“Of course, the poor fools couldn’t know he was mine!” she exclaimed\r\nfinally.\r\n\r\nAnd then her keen ears caught the expression “mine” and she turned\r\nher wrath on herself for the lapse into the old jargon of the\r\nslave-marriage régime.\r\n\r\n“He’s not _mine_ and I’m not _his_ after all,” she admitted.\r\n“He can do as he pleases and I can do as I please. He pleases to sulk.\r\nLet him sulk. He’s free--so am I. And I thank God I am. I wouldn’t be\r\nchained to such a brute; at least, I’ve escaped that tragedy!”\r\n\r\nShe confronted herself with the philosophic reflection that their\r\nfree alliance was being tried under conditions most unfavorable. To\r\nannounce it to the world would be the open avowal of a crime under the\r\npresent slave laws of marriage. In the new moral world of freedom and\r\nindividualism such announcements would be made, of course. And this\r\nwould take the place of the present system of registration.\r\n\r\nThis announcement would make such a scene as the one witnessed at\r\nthe dinner party impossible. But would it? The more she thought of\r\nthe ravenous hunger of those matchmaking mothers the graver became\r\nthe doubt. The first sense of misgiving as to the perfection of her\r\nnew ideal crept into her consciousness and made her ill. Would the\r\nmatchmakers stop because of a mere “announcement” which has no legal\r\nmeaning? The announcement of a free alliance meant that each party\r\nto the agreement would remain at all times free to quit--the moment\r\nthe arrangement ceased to be mutually satisfactory. A pretty girl and\r\ndesigning mother might make the most ideal arrangement unsatisfactory\r\nwith a little time to manage it. They would, too, unless those mothers\r\nand pretty girls could be killed off or made over again.\r\n\r\nThe more she thought of it the deeper became the conviction that one of\r\nthese vampires would get Manning.\r\n\r\nShe wondered what he was doing to-night. It was the fourth day since\r\ntheir return from Long Island and not a word had been received from\r\nhim. She had sworn never to call him again. She had been too ill to\r\nwork to-day and had gone to bed at noon.\r\n\r\nIf she could only get him on the telephone and say that she was ill he\r\nwould come, of course. She shrank from the baby act. But the temptation\r\nwas too strong once the idea took possession of her.\r\n\r\nShe would ring his apartment. He must be there at this hour unless he\r\nhad gone out for a late dinner. His work at the office was finished at\r\neleven-thirty. It was now twelve. A call at this late hour would be an\r\nabject confession on her part. What of it? Her misery was abject. Her\r\nrepentance should be equally so.\r\n\r\nShe seized the telephone eagerly.\r\n\r\nShe heard him take the receiver from the hook at last! Her heart beat\r\nwith pain.\r\n\r\n“Well, what is it?” he asked in quick business-like tones. He evidently\r\nthought the office had called. He hadn’t answered her after all.\r\n\r\nHer hand trembled so violently as she tried to hang up she fumbled and\r\nmissed it.\r\n\r\n“Well, well, what is it?” he repeated wearily.\r\n\r\nThere was a note of suffering in his tones that caught her. She\r\ncouldn’t endure it.\r\n\r\n“Haven’t you punished me enough now, dear love-man?” she said softly:\r\n\r\n“Oh--it’s you!”\r\n\r\n“Please come quickly. I’ve been ill all day. I can’t sleep. Will you\r\ncome?”\r\n\r\nHe hesitated and she could feel the iron grip of his hand on the\r\ntelephone as he answered:\r\n\r\n“Yes; right away.”\r\n\r\nShe met him at the door and sprang into his arms with a cry of anguish.\r\n\r\n“Oh, how could you be so cruel!”\r\n\r\nHe smoothed the mass of waving hair with tender touch.\r\n\r\n“Have you missed me?”\r\n\r\nShe pressed him close.\r\n\r\n“You have a heart of stone,” she groaned.\r\n\r\n“But you shut me out of your life at a moment when I was tired and ill\r\nwith worry. This is a free alliance by your stern decree. You had the\r\nright to put me out, but it hurt.”\r\n\r\nShe was too honest to whine and say she hadn’t meant to hurt him. Only\r\nshe hadn’t quite figured the possibilities of her act. She wouldn’t lie\r\nout of it.\r\n\r\n“Forgive me; I’m sorry,” she murmured.\r\n\r\nShe was too honest to swear it wouldn’t happen again. He felt the\r\nstrength of her remarkable character as never before. He admired her\r\nfor it in a way and yet it chilled the ardor of their reconciliation.\r\nIt left a bitter taste in their kisses.\r\n\r\n“You won’t be sullen again, will you, dear?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll try not to.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll begin all over again now!” she cried. “I’ll love you harder than\r\never!”\r\n\r\nShe paused, drew his head down and whispered: “And I’ll never have\r\nanother fit of idiotic jealousy.”\r\n\r\n“Never?”\r\n\r\n“Never--I’m cured.”\r\n\r\nShe kissed him again with clinging tenderness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n                            THE NEW TYRANNY\r\n\r\n\r\nELLEN West discovered to her sorrow that freedom had its drawbacks.\r\nThe first quarrel was a serious one. It had been settled by a complete\r\nsurrender on her part. The settlement was far from satisfactory. The\r\nbitter taste of defeat remained.\r\n\r\nThe trouble was this idea of an open shop.\r\n\r\nThe conception of life was fundamental to the maintenance of the new\r\ncreed. Manning must be free. She must be free. She had reasoned this\r\nout beyond argument. Freedom implied the right of any woman to bid for\r\nhis favor. It implied the right of any man to bid for hers.\r\n\r\nShe tried for six months the plan of isolation. She dreaded another\r\nquarrel. Manning was the type of man who took quarrels seriously. He\r\nswore that all was forgiven and forgotten. She knew it was untrue.\r\nAgain and again she caught him in absent-minded brooding. She knew the\r\npoison which their first quarrel had planted in his heart was still\r\ndoing its deadly work.\r\n\r\nShe scrupulously avoided all social gatherings. If they should be\r\ntogether there might be a repetition of the misery of Brown’s week-end\r\nparty. If she should go alone, he would be uneasy about the men who\r\nwould show her attentions. That she should permit him to go alone was\r\nout of the question.\r\n\r\nThe tension of their perpetual suspicions was serious enough without\r\nthe added strain of social frivolities. A new difficulty arose with the\r\nplan of isolation. They began to get on each other’s nerves. He chafed\r\nat the lack of the sane companionship of friends and acquaintances.\r\nShe could see the brooding hunger in his eyes. He was thinking of his\r\ninfernal old-fashioned ideal of a home fireside, children, and friends!\r\n\r\nHe began to spend more time at his clubs. He was a member of three now.\r\n\r\nHe lied about his clubs at first. A mild quarrel ensued--mild in its\r\noutburst of emotion, but deadly in its effect on their inner relations.\r\nHe pretended to be tied down at his desk. She found one night that he\r\nwas not at the office, called each of his clubs and located him. Next\r\nday, with deliberate malice, she asked him about his work the night\r\nbefore and led him into a description of its details.\r\n\r\nShe suddenly turned on him.\r\n\r\n“You’re lying to me!”\r\n\r\nSurprised for a moment he quickly recovered and shocked her with his\r\nanswer. She expected him to fence and hedge and lie again. Instead he\r\ntold her the brutal truth in a way that cut to the quick.\r\n\r\n“Of course I lied. It seemed the easiest way. We’ve been getting on\r\neach other’s nerves lately. We’re seeing too much of one another.”\r\n\r\n“And yet you wish to chain me for life with a marriage ceremony!”\r\n\r\nHe twisted his mouth with a savage force, drew his heavy eyebrows low\r\nand remained silent.\r\n\r\n“You did; didn’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Did what?” he asked absently.\r\n\r\n“Wished to chain me for life!”\r\n\r\nHis mouth slowly relaxed and a dreamy look overspread his mobile face.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I did, but the links of the chain I was dreaming about were made\r\nof baby fingers.”\r\n\r\nShe gave no answer. She refused to lower herself to the level of the\r\nold masculine subterfuge. Maternity was for the ignorant. Reproduction\r\nwas the blindest, stupidest act of all nature. A fish could lay a\r\nmillion eggs in one season. She thanked God that she had passed the\r\nfish stage of self-development.\r\n\r\nWith an effort of supreme will she controlled her anger and ended the\r\nquarrel.\r\n\r\n“Come, man, no more quarrels,” she said lightly. “Take me to a matinée.\r\nI’m hungry for a good play.”\r\n\r\nFor a month she skillfully avoided too many meetings, and saw with keen\r\ninterest his revived loyalty. Again she was confirmed in her creed. It\r\nwas the perpetual daily friction of personal contact that made marriage\r\na martyrdom. She had been trying unconsciously to renew the same\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThere was still much lacking in the scheme of isolation. He must have\r\nhuman companionship. He must feel the touch of the world. The herd\r\ninstinct in man she knew to be the oldest and deepest of all forces\r\nunderlying character. She was trying to create a new world forgetting\r\nthis force. It couldn’t be done.\r\n\r\nThe compromise must be found. Anxious hours she spent in working out\r\nits details. The only practical thing was a certain amount of publicity\r\nwhich must be given to the fact of their union by the new ceremony of\r\nannouncement.\r\n\r\nAgain she was confronted with the old régime and its hateful\r\ncelebration of the union of man and woman! And yet there seemed no\r\nother way out of an intolerable situation. It was impossible for a man\r\nand woman to completely isolate themselves from human society and find\r\nsatisfaction merely in the union of their individual lives.\r\n\r\nThe remedy lay in a careful selection of free men and women as the\r\nchosen circle in which they would move. She determined to select these\r\npeople and announce to each of them the fact of their union. Within\r\nthis charmed circle of equals they would have a world all their own\r\nwithin a world of slaves.\r\n\r\nShe proposed the scheme for his approval.\r\n\r\n“Do as you like, dear,” he replied carelessly. “It will be all right\r\nwith me.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you think it will be the solution of our little troubles?” she\r\nasked with some irritation.\r\n\r\n“Hadn’t thought of it--worth trying--go to it.”\r\n\r\nHis attitude of absorbed indifference roused her anger. Absorbed in\r\nhimself and his career, and indifferent to hers or her happiness! But\r\nwhy fret and fume! If it were true, fretting and fuming would only\r\naggravate, not cure the trouble.\r\n\r\nShe selected carefully a hundred men and women of intelligence and\r\nsympathy enrolled in the feminist movement. They belonged to the\r\nrational wing. Each one of them held equally positive views on the\r\nsubject of marriage and they would view with approval or enthusiasm the\r\nexperiment which she had inaugurated in the new code of social ethics.\r\n\r\nShe began in her Fifth Avenue apartment a series of afternoon teas and\r\nSunday evening receptions. They were an instantaneous success. For\r\nthe first time since her union with the man of her choice she felt\r\nthoroughly at ease in a social gathering. There was just the touch of\r\nadventure in the situation which gave it zest and lifted the affair\r\nabove the banality of the ordinary social function.\r\n\r\nShe was the high priestess of a new religion and felt the strength of\r\nthe faith of sympathetic followers.\r\n\r\nManning, of course, attended the functions. Otherwise they could have\r\nhad no meaning, beyond the mere killing of time in pleasant social\r\nconversation. To Ellen’s annoyance she found that he was rapidly\r\nbecoming the chief source of interest to the women. With increasing\r\nemphasis her followers were dilating on the beauty of freedom--with the\r\naccent on the freedom.\r\n\r\nIt was becoming more and more painfully evident that some of her less\r\nfortunate sisters who were possessed of a beauty which equalled hers,\r\nand yet struggled to make both ends meet on an income of twenty dollars\r\na week, were attending with unfailing regularity. It was equally\r\napparent that they had but the slightest interest in their hostess.\r\nThey sought Manning with brazen effrontery and literally sat at his\r\nfeet. There was no such thing as shaking them off.\r\n\r\nEllen watched them with amused contempt for a few weeks and then\r\nwith growing anger. She could read in their cat-like eyes the cunning\r\nappraisal of his income. A man with an income of ten thousand a year\r\nthey could not meet every day in New York. She watched their subtle\r\nflatteries and pandering to his masculine vanities.\r\n\r\nVera Daly, a young illustrator on the staff of her own magazine, was\r\nthe most unscrupulous of the group of his satellites. She dressed with\r\na voluptuous suggestiveness that bordered on vulgarity and affected the\r\nairs of high brow art in a way that provoked Ellen beyond endurance.\r\n\r\nIt reached a climax on a Thursday afternoon when she had absorbed\r\nManning for more than an hour without giving even one of her rivals a\r\nchance to slip in a word edgewise.\r\n\r\nEllen watched the scene until she could endure it no longer. She walked\r\nstraight to them and touched Miss Daly on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n“May I see you a moment?”\r\n\r\nThe girl turned with a look of annoyed surprise and rose slowly.\r\n\r\n“Won’t you excuse me, Mr. Manning,” she beamed, “while I answer Miss\r\nWest’s call--don’t run away. I’ve a lot more to tell you.”\r\n\r\nEllen led the way to the balcony, entered her bedroom, and held the\r\ndoor open until the young artist had entered.\r\n\r\nShe closed the door quickly and faced the offender. Her face was\r\nflushed, her eyes sparkling with rage.\r\n\r\n“Miss Daly, you attempt to make love to my mate every time you come to\r\nmy apartment.”\r\n\r\nThe arched brows of the artist were lifted in a movement of contempt.\r\n\r\n“We live in a new, free world, Miss West,” she drawled. “Mr. Manning\r\nis the most intellectual, the most charming man I have ever met. I was\r\nirresistibly drawn to him from the moment we were introduced.”\r\n\r\n“The attraction has not been mutual.”\r\n\r\n“Then why worry?”\r\n\r\n“You are thrusting your attentions on him.”\r\n\r\nThe fine shoulders were slightly shrugged.\r\n\r\n“I haven’t noticed any resentment on his part.”\r\n\r\n“No, as my guest he must treat you politely.”\r\n\r\n“He has, I assure you!” she laughed.\r\n\r\n“I trust it will not be necessary for me to tell you in so many words\r\nthat your presence is not desired here again.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not. I have Mr. Manning’s telephone.”\r\n\r\n“He gave it to you?” she asked in rage.\r\n\r\n“I asked him for it and he couldn’t refuse. I shall see him when I\r\nplease, if he wishes it as much as I do. I like your cheek in taking\r\nme to task in this insulting manner. You are free to seek a new lover.\r\nHe is free to respond to my love if I can win him.”\r\n\r\n“You confess that you are in love with him?”\r\n\r\n“He interests me. It’s a free world, you know. Do you wish me to leave\r\nimmediately?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Very good. I shall announce that I have been asked to leave the room\r\nbecause I made eyes at your property!”\r\n\r\nEllen gripped her arm.\r\n\r\n“Stay, please. You are my guest. I apologize most humbly.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t mention it,” she sneered, opening the door and hurrying\r\ndownstairs.\r\n\r\nEllen watched her return to Manning’s side with deliberate malice and\r\nresume her conversation.\r\n\r\nShe made her decision instantly. These functions would not be repeated.\r\nThey were enormously popular with the women. It was only too plain that\r\nthe primitive instincts of the average woman could not be eradicated in\r\na day.\r\n\r\nThe young she-devil with whom she had just fought would certainly stop\r\nat nothing to carry her point. She thought of the possibilities of her\r\ncharacter with a shudder.\r\n\r\nManning heard the announcement of her decision with quiet joy.\r\n\r\n“I’m glad you’ve had enough,” he said simply.\r\n\r\n“You don’t mind the loss of so many charming admirers?” she asked\r\nunsteadily.\r\n\r\n“I devoutly thank God to be rid of them!”\r\n\r\n“Sure you don’t regret Miss Vera Daly?”\r\n\r\n“Quite sure.”\r\n\r\n“You were not even interested?”\r\n\r\n“Interested in studying her as a type of the cheap adventuress who has\r\nadopted your creed in search of new emotions.”\r\n\r\nA feeling of immense relief swept her.\r\n\r\n“You’re a very sensible, honest-to-God old sweetheart!” she cried, and\r\ngave him a kiss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n                           SELF-DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the year which followed, Manning dropped into the habit of spending\r\nmore and more time at his clubs. He developed two groups of friends\r\nwith whom he played poker. He told Ellen about his games, his winnings\r\nand losses. She tried to take an interest in it for his sake. But as\r\nhis absences increased and his attentions grew more conventional, a\r\ndumb misery began to smother her brain and render work impossible.\r\n\r\nShe had made no real progress in her work since her love-affair began.\r\nHe had forged rapidly ahead and, then, when the nagging, quarrelling\r\nand unhappiness began, he too had stood still. He had learned to play a\r\nbetter game of poker, but his ambitions had waned.\r\n\r\nShe realized this with a sense of keen pain and made another desperate\r\neffort to regain their ideal. They had both intended to write plays.\r\nShe had studied dramatic construction and had done a one-act piece\r\nwhich had been produced by a stage society of advanced thinkers.\r\n\r\nShe proposed to him a collaboration in a four-act drama of the marriage\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nHe jumped at the idea and they began the next day. He insisted on a\r\nthorough re-study of the fundamental tenets of feminism. She supplied\r\nthe books with eager anticipation of his conversion to her faiths.\r\n\r\nAs he finished the reading of each revolutionary volume they discussed\r\nit together. His antagonism was invincible. He could find a dozen\r\nobjections to every proposition her favorite authors propounded.\r\n\r\n“Why do you try to antagonize every idea suggested?” she asked, finally\r\nworn out with his continuous pounding.\r\n\r\n“It’s the only way to get the truth. It must be tested out. I try to\r\nsee things the way these women view it. I see it the man’s way. I am a\r\nman, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Try it my way,” she pleaded. “Can’t you use your imagination? Can’t\r\nyou put yourself in my place?”\r\n\r\n“Why should I?” he protested. “If I am to contribute anything to the\r\nthought of the world it must be as a man--not as a woman.”\r\n\r\nIn an endless wrangle over the question of the differences of the\r\nsexes the collaboration drifted gradually into personal quarrels which\r\nrendered work impossible.\r\n\r\nHe gave up in a temper at last, bolted the house and sulked for a week,\r\nrefusing to call or be called.\r\n\r\nShe got him in a fit of depression, he answered the telephone and\r\nhurried to her apartment.\r\n\r\nShe held his hand in silence for a long time when the door had closed.\r\n\r\n“Tell me, dear, what is the matter with us?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” he replied wearily.\r\n\r\n“Is it all my fault?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think so.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me honestly why you’re so unhappy and why I catch it and we\r\nquarrel?”\r\n\r\n“You want to know the God’s truth?”\r\n\r\n“Desperately--tell me.”\r\n\r\n“Too much self-development!”\r\n\r\nShe flushed angrily.\r\n\r\n“On your part or mine?”\r\n\r\n“Both, I suppose,” he admitted.\r\n\r\n“Mine principally?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” she urged, “go on!”\r\n\r\nHe twisted the muscles of his mouth and gazed out of the window.\r\n\r\n“You see, it’s like this. The chief aim in your life is\r\nself-development. You have no time to devote to the development of your\r\nmate. A man is a vain brute. He needs to be petted and flattered. In\r\nhis weak soul he wants a woman to make a fuss over him, to tell him\r\nhe’s great, to inspire him to achievements.”\r\n\r\n“In other words,” Ellen interrupted sneeringly, “he wishes to be\r\nworshipped while pretending to worship his mate!”\r\n\r\n“By George! I hadn’t thought of it exactly that way, but I believe\r\nyou’re half right. You see, while we are both bent on self-development\r\nwe can’t be of much help to one another. We are sensitive. We’re\r\nforever and eternally dissecting ourselves. We live and move in an\r\natmosphere of impatience and spiritual turmoil.”\r\n\r\nShe smiled eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Let’s reform!”\r\n\r\n“I will if you will.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a go.”\r\n\r\nThey shook hands and settled to a hard evening’s work on the\r\nconstruction of the first tentative plot of the play.\r\n\r\nThey had scarcely begun when a faint knock was heard.\r\n\r\n“Who on earth?” she murmured in astonishment.\r\n\r\n“The fool next door,” Manning growled.\r\n\r\n“Impossible. Field’s off to Japan again.”\r\n\r\nAgain the timid knock. It came fainter this time.\r\n\r\n“You’d better go,” he urged. “Dora will let them in.”\r\n\r\nShe rose in time to stop the maid. She opened the door and gasped in\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\nA little miniature of herself stood trembling with fear.\r\n\r\n“Is this my Aunt Ellen?” she faltered.\r\n\r\nEllen laughed.\r\n\r\n“It must be, dear, if you say so. You make me think I’ve died and come\r\nto life again. You dear, adorable little thing; come in.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” she sighed.\r\n\r\nShe carried a hand bag which appeared to be very light. She opened it\r\nwith nervous, trembling fingers and drew out a crumpled letter.\r\n\r\nEllen edged her into the dining-room, shielding her from the range of\r\nManning’s vision.\r\n\r\nThe girl handed her the letter and Ellen read it hurriedly. It was\r\nfrom her invalid sister in Texas, who had gone to the Far West for her\r\nhealth five years ago. The handwriting was clear, but bore the mark of\r\nphysical weakness.\r\n\r\nDEAR ELLEN:\r\n\r\n This is my little girl Rose. I’m not getting well as rapidly as I\r\n hoped. I can’t see my baby grow into womanhood in this Godforsaken\r\n desert without a fight. Sam is making a bare living. I’ve read your\r\n wonderful book about woman. Won’t you get work for my Rose and give\r\n her a chance in life? She’s a dear, good girl and has learned to do\r\n first-class work on a typewriter. I send her to you in perfect faith\r\n that you love me and will help her.\r\n\r\n                     Affectionately, your sister,\r\n                                                           ROSE O’NEIL.\r\n\r\nEllen looked at her tenderly.\r\n\r\n“Your name is Rose, too?”\r\n\r\n“Yes’m,” She answered lightly, and then gulped down the cry of\r\nloneliness at the thought of her mother.\r\n\r\nEllen watched her keenly.\r\n\r\n“I hated to leave her,” she faltered. “I just wouldn’t come until she\r\nmade me. But my brother’s ten years old now and he can help her some. I\r\nnearly cried my eyes out on the train. I was so lonesome----”\r\n\r\nShe choked and was silent.\r\n\r\nEllen slipped her arm around her tenderly.\r\n\r\n“Well, you won’t be lonesome again, my sweet little Rose. You’re going\r\nto live with me.”\r\n\r\n“Live--with--you?”\r\n\r\nShe couldn’t believe her ears. Her mother had merely told her that her\r\nfamous aunt would help her to get work and make something of herself.\r\nShe had loved this tall, distinguished aunt from the first sight and\r\nher happiness was complete at the joyous announcement that they could\r\nlive together.\r\n\r\nRose drew Ellen’s head down and kissed her while the tears rolled down\r\nher cheeks. The older woman’s arms stole around the girl.\r\n\r\n“My sweet little Rose,” she repeated softly, “you’ll bring, me luck.\r\nI’ve been lonely, too, of late.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll do my best to help you,” Rose responded eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Come into the library now and meet my friend, who is helping me write\r\na play.”\r\n\r\n“A man?”\r\n\r\n“How did you guess?” Ellen laughed.\r\n\r\n“Saw a hat.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, a man.”\r\n\r\n“May I fix my hair a little?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” Ellen smiled indulgently, “you look so much like me, you\r\nmust look your best always.”\r\n\r\n“My mother always said so,” she whispered excitedly.\r\n\r\nEllen led her into the bedroom adjoining hers and threw on the light.\r\n\r\n“This is your room, dear.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, isn’t it beautiful--isn’t it wonderful!” she cried in rapture.\r\n“I’m so happy I’m afraid I’ll die.”\r\n\r\nEllen smiled.\r\n\r\n“Brush yourself up and come right down.”\r\n\r\n“In a jiffy!”\r\n\r\nEllen left her prinking at the mirror in joyous haste and reported to\r\nManning the extraordinary arrival.\r\n\r\n“And you are going to keep her here with you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I fell in love with the silly thing the minute I saw her.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you think it will be awkward?”\r\n\r\n“Not at all. That there is anything between us more than the friendship\r\nof fellow writers, she will not suspect for a moment.”\r\n\r\n“I think it unwise,” he protested.\r\n\r\n“Nonsense.”\r\n\r\n“How old is she?”\r\n\r\n“She must be twenty.”\r\n\r\n“A very serious age; you’ll get into trouble.”\r\n\r\n“She looks but sixteen and isn’t older in knowledge of the world. I can\r\ntell from the look in her frank young eyes.”\r\n\r\n“Better send her to school.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll teach her myself.”\r\n\r\n“And make a new woman of her?” he asked with a touch of malice.\r\n\r\n“Yes!”\r\n\r\n“I’ve a premonition of trouble.”\r\n\r\n“Forget it, boy,” she answered gaily. “I’ve recovered my spirits with\r\nthe acceptance of this burden. There may be something in the old idea\r\nof self-sacrifice after all. Anyhow, it won’t be all self-sacrifice.\r\nShe’ll do my typewriting.”\r\n\r\n“She’s a stenographer?” he asked in alarm.\r\n\r\n“Only a typist.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, well, that may not be so bad.”\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter with stenographers?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Then why the fire alarm in your voice at the thought?”\r\n\r\n“I just can’t stand a girl stenographer; that’s all. You’ll find that\r\nthe kid’s a serious mistake.”\r\n\r\nHe stopped in amazement at the vision before him. Rose had softly\r\ndescended the stairs and entered the room with scarcely an echo\r\nof her light footfall on the thick carpet. Her face was flushed\r\nwith excitement and the slender girlish figure was trembling in\r\nembarrassment.\r\n\r\nHe wondered if she could have heard his last unkind remark. She was\r\nsmiling so sweetly it was impossible. He saw at once that she was so\r\nself-conscious from the excitement of the meeting that she had heard\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n“This is my friend, Mr. Manning, Miss Rose O’Neil,” Ellen said.\r\n\r\nManning sprang to his feet instinctively and took the soft little\r\nextended hand.\r\n\r\nHe was dumbfounded at the startling resemblance between them.\r\n\r\n“I never saw anything like it in my life!” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Like--like what?” Rose stammered.\r\n\r\n“Why, the resemblance between you two,” he hastened to explain, looking\r\nfirst at one and then the other.\r\n\r\n“She’s your miniature?” he added with a nod toward Ellen.\r\n\r\n“The most startling resemblance,” she agreed. “I suppose that’s why I\r\nfell in love with her at sight,” she added banteringly.\r\n\r\n“Shouldn’t be surprised,” he agreed maliciously.\r\n\r\n“My mother loved my auntie so, she was always talking about her. I\r\nreckon that’s why I look like her.”\r\n\r\nShe glanced at Ellen and blushed joyously at the idea of the\r\nresemblance.\r\n\r\n“Her eyes are exactly the shade of yours,” Manning observed; “her hair\r\nthe same, complexion the same.”\r\n\r\n“A little freckled,” Rose complained.\r\n\r\n“They’ll fade here, my child,” he reassured her, continuing the\r\ninventory, “and the funny thing is she walks just like you and talks\r\nlike you.”\r\n\r\nHe paused and wrinkled his brow thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“I wonder now,” he added.\r\n\r\n“Wonder what?” Rose asked.\r\n\r\n“Nothing worth knowing, dear,” her aunt answered with a look of\r\nreproach at Manning.\r\n\r\n“I was just wondering what your first ambition in life is?”\r\n\r\n“Why, to work hard, make some money and help my mother.”\r\n\r\n“And then?”\r\n\r\n“Why--then--I’ll just get married, of course!”\r\n\r\nManning laughed immoderately and Rose blushed furiously.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter with that?” Rose asked simply.\r\n\r\n“Nothing at all, my dear,” Ellen hastened to assure her. “Mr. Manning\r\nwas trying to tease you.”\r\n\r\nFor two hours Manning persisted in question after question, which\r\ndeveloped the girl’s old-fashioned ideals to Ellen’s annoyance.\r\n\r\nShe interrupted him at last with an emphatic dismissal for the evening.\r\n\r\n“You can toddle home now, Mr. Man,” she said. “I want to talk awhile to\r\nmy niece. I can’t get in a word with you here.”\r\n\r\nHe rose with a laugh, and at the door Ellen spoke in low tones.\r\n\r\n“You’ve been very hateful to-night.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t mean it, I assure you. I was only showing you the size of the\r\njob you’ve cut out for yourself in her education.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll attend to that without help.”\r\n\r\n“Shall I cease to call?”\r\n\r\n“Please--don’t quarrel, dear man. We began all over again to-night.”\r\n\r\n“To-morrow, then, we work in earnest?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; beginning at nine.”\r\n\r\n“With a friendly wave of his long arm he said:\r\n\r\n“Good-night!”\r\n\r\nAnd all the way home he chuckled over the funny contradiction in the\r\nminiature edition of Ellen and the mind inside the miniature.\r\n\r\nEllen talked for another hour to her worshipful little niece and kissed\r\nher good-night without the slightest premonition of the tragic train of\r\nevents which her coming had set in motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n                              ROSE O’NEIL\r\n\r\n\r\nELLEN awoke the following morning with a sense of relief. Rose’s\r\nprattle had refreshed her soul. The girl’s happiness was so real, her\r\nworship so sweet and soothing to her vanity, it was impossible to be\r\nwith the child and not catch the contagious happiness that bubbled from\r\nher heart.\r\n\r\nTo her vivid young mind her aunt was the perfection of glorified\r\nwomanhood. Her mother’s praises had, of course, prepared her for this\r\nopinion, yet the impression Ellen had made far surpassed in reality all\r\nher mother had suggested.\r\n\r\nThis attitude of worship would make her education a joy. Ellen\r\ndetermined to begin it at once before the roar of New York’s colossal\r\nlife could confuse her. She would begin, of course, by finding out her\r\nattitude toward the cause of woman.\r\n\r\n“We’ll devote the first hour every morning, dear,” Ellen announced at\r\nbreakfast, “to laying out your studies for the day.”\r\n\r\nRose’s eyes sparkled.\r\n\r\n“Oh, that’s so sweet of you to give the first fresh hour of the day to\r\npoor little me. I’m so proud, I’ll hardly speak to myself after this.”\r\n\r\nEllen shot her a look of sharp inquiry. Could she be posing with such\r\na speech? Impossible! The look out of her honest young eyes was too\r\nsincere. Her resemblance to herself was so striking, it was unthinkable\r\nto accuse her of posing. The thought was dismissed. She was honest, in\r\nearnest, utterly frank, utterly sincere. It was worth one’s time to\r\nteach her.\r\n\r\n“You’ve read my book on ‘The Modern Woman Movement,’ dear?” Ellen asked\r\nwhen they reached the library.\r\n\r\nRose blushed.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry I haven’t, auntie. But mama did and she says it’s the\r\ngreatest book anybody ever wrote. She’s so proud of it she shows it to\r\neverybody that comes and shows them your autograph on the first leaf,\r\nand you ought to hear her say:\r\n\r\n“My sister’s the most stately and beautiful woman I ever saw!”\r\n\r\nShe imitated her mother’s tones in a way that made Ellen smile. She had\r\nmeant to express her surprise that she had not read her book carefully.\r\nRose apologized so skilfully, the intended rebuke ended in a glow of\r\npersonal vanity. She had been flattered before by men and women, but\r\nthere was something so frank and real in this unsophisticated girl’s\r\nadmiration it gave her new strength.\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ll have you read that first, and we’ll be better acquainted\r\nwith each other.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll read it right away,” was the eager response.\r\n\r\nEllen gently and skilfully set about to draw out her ideal of the woman\r\nof to-day.\r\n\r\n“Tell me, what is the dearest wish of your heart?”\r\n\r\nRose smiled.\r\n\r\n“You’ll not laugh?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Marry a fine man and have about six or seven children!”\r\n\r\n“Is that all?”\r\n\r\n“Isn’t that enough children?”\r\n\r\n“Quite.”\r\n\r\n“Well, maybe eight. But I think ten’s really too many. They seem to get\r\non top of one another if there’s that many, don’t you think?”\r\n\r\n“I agree with you,” Ellen responded gravely.\r\n\r\n“We had a neighbor in Texas who had ten and the mother could never keep\r\ntheir faces washed all at one time. I think that’s awful, don’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Very bad.”\r\n\r\nThe leader of the crusade was searching for a possible opening in which\r\nto lodge a revolutionary idea. It would be cruel and unwise to strike\r\nher in the face with the declaration of her creed.\r\n\r\n“Aren’t you afraid of being the slave of a man if you marry?” Ellen\r\ninquired cautiously.\r\n\r\n“Gracious, no; I expect to be!”\r\n\r\n“But don’t you want to develop yourself, dear?”\r\n\r\nRose studied her aunt’s question.\r\n\r\n“You mean study and read and work as you tell me?”\r\n\r\n“I mean more than that. I mean when you’ve finished your school days,\r\ndon’t you want to go on developing yourself?”\r\n\r\nShe shook her head promptly.\r\n\r\n“No. I want to give all of myself to my home and the kids.”\r\n\r\nEllen broke into a hearty laugh. Her job was larger than she had\r\nfigured. Evidently this fair miniature of herself was a striking\r\nexample of a reversion to type. Probably her poor mother had felt the\r\ntask hopeless and took the radical step of breaking her environment at\r\nhome once and forever.\r\n\r\nGrave misgivings of the outcome of her teaching Rose. The little\r\none had decided opinions of her own when put to the test. There was\r\nno hesitation about her answers when she was sure of no offence. It\r\nwould be necessary to use the utmost care in approaching her positive\r\npersonality.\r\n\r\nEllen was gravely studying the fine face bent in earnest over her book\r\nwhen Manning’s rap startled her.\r\n\r\n“Run now, dear, and study in your room while Mr. Manning and I work.”\r\n\r\n“Let me stay just a minute?” she pleaded.\r\n\r\n“What for?”\r\n\r\n“Just to say ‘howdy do’!”\r\n\r\nEllen hesitated.\r\n\r\n“All right; just five minutes; and then to your work.”\r\n\r\nRose flushed with excitement as he rapped the second time.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I think he’s just grand!” she murmured as Ellen opened the door.\r\n\r\nShe had been careful to give Manning the full view of the room, with\r\nRose in the background as he entered. A thoughtless word or kiss might\r\nhave been awkward.\r\n\r\nHis greeting was so carefully casual Ellen resented it and yet was\r\nexactly as he should have made it.\r\n\r\nHe waved his arm toward Rose.\r\n\r\n“Good-morning, little one!”\r\n\r\n“Good-morning!” she responded cheerily.\r\n\r\n“Ready for the typewriting?”\r\n\r\n“When auntie gets the machine.”\r\n\r\n“Well, she’ll be getting it soon. I feel like work to-day--and you,\r\nMiss West?”\r\n\r\n“Never more fit, sir,” was the prompt answer.\r\n\r\nAgain she resented the conventional “Miss” he had put before her name.\r\nWhat else could he do? It irritated her to be compelled to recognize\r\nthe fact that he was doing the only thing that was possible under the\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nRose lingered.\r\n\r\nHer aunt turned at last and said:\r\n\r\n“Run along now, child, and read until I call you.”\r\n\r\n“All right; but do let me help if I can!”\r\n\r\nManning waved to her retreating figure.\r\n\r\n“The minute Act I is ready the typewriting begins.”\r\n\r\n“I drew her out this morning,” Ellen said laughingly when she had\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n“On what?”\r\n\r\n“The cause of woman.”\r\n\r\n“I can tell you her views.”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“Shall I?”\r\n\r\n“Try.”\r\n\r\n“She’s your miniature in face and budding form--a complete reversion to\r\ntype in character.”\r\n\r\n“Correct.”\r\n\r\n“Her one dream in life is hubby, home and baby.”\r\n\r\n“No?”\r\n\r\n“Babies! Seven!”\r\n\r\n“Really?”\r\n\r\nThey both laughed.\r\n\r\n“She had thought of eight, possibly, but drew the line at ten.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m glad there’s some trace of restraint.”\r\n\r\nManning caught Ellen’s keen eyes studying him intently. His laughter\r\nhad been real, his enjoyment of the joke genuine, and yet she wondered\r\nif he had quite concealed his admiration for the lovely, fresh young\r\ngirl and her appealing ideal.\r\n\r\nHe dropped his eyes unconsciously before her gaze. She had uncanny\r\nintuitions. There was no doubt of her ability at times to read his\r\nthoughts. He was not surprised when she said musingly:\r\n\r\n“You admire her?”\r\n\r\n“I think she’s adorable,” was the frank reply.\r\n\r\n“Because she’s so much like me or unlike me?”\r\n\r\n“Both.”\r\n\r\n“Oh----!”\r\n\r\n“When I look at her I see you in the first dawn of an exquisite\r\ngirlhood. When she begins to talk I hear the old-fashioned songs and\r\nlullabies. But we must get to work. Come; that plot has been deviling\r\nthe soul out of my body the past night. I can’t get it right.”\r\n\r\nHer eyes were still searching him. She was puzzled. An ugly fear had\r\nsuddenly gripped her. It was too ugly to be real. It was too ugly to\r\nframe into speech. She could only shiver at the thought of it. Her\r\nfirst impulse was to send Rose O’Neil packing home on the next train.\r\nIt was too mean and cowardly for a serious consideration. Besides, the\r\nchild had caught her heart with a queer tenderness. She had been happy\r\nto feel her near. She had slept sounder because she was in the next\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nWith an effort she threw off the morbid fancy and hurried to the table,\r\non which were piled their papers of the play.\r\n\r\nIn the rush of work she forgot the ugly thought, absorbed in the\r\nproblems of the drama. At the end of two hours they were no nearer the\r\nsolution than at the beginning.\r\n\r\n“Let’s call Rose down and try the story on her?” Manning suggested.\r\n\r\nEllen threw him a startled look.\r\n\r\n“Absurd!”\r\n\r\n“Not at all, I assure you,” he insisted.\r\n\r\n“A twenty-year-old school girl--you must think her inspired.”\r\n\r\n“Far from it. On the other hand, her mind is precisely the medium\r\nthrough which we must put our story if addressed to an audience. I\r\nhaven’t studied the technique of playwriting as you have. But I have\r\nstudied the mind of the mob. I did some public speaking, and the thing\r\ninterested me enormously. Some great books have been written on the\r\npsychology of the crowd. It’s entirely different from the mind of the\r\nindividual reader.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense.”\r\n\r\n“It’s true. You can only get into the head of an audience what will\r\nget into the head of the lowest intelligences in it. If you have a\r\nthousand college professors before you and mix among them a hundred\r\nchamber-maids, you have poured a gallon of ink into a barrel of clear\r\nwater. The mixture is the medium through which you must pass your rays\r\nof light to make your mental impression in the crowd. You can cut any\r\nsort of mental gymnastics in a story that is written for an individual\r\nreader who sits alone by the fire and reads at his leisure. When you\r\naddress an audience your proposition must be simple, your process of\r\nreasoning elemental.”\r\n\r\nEllen had received the suggestion of submitting the plot to Rose with\r\na quick return of her morbid fancy. She had watched Manning begin his\r\nphilosophic explanation with even greater suspicions. At the end of his\r\nlong speech she not only found herself convinced, but was heartily\r\nashamed of her foolish fears and her unfair suspicions.\r\n\r\nShe made up her mind, once for all, to put jealous suspicions out of\r\nher heart forever, otherwise there would be no end of unhappy bickering\r\nand quarrelling.\r\n\r\nShe smiled admiringly.\r\n\r\n“Really, man,” she said banteringly, “you speak with almost human\r\nintelligence.”\r\n\r\nHe bowed humbly.\r\n\r\n“Thanks.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll call Rose at once and try it on her.”\r\n\r\n“Of course the experiment can only be approximately correct.”\r\n\r\n“We should have a crowd of Roses?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly.”\r\n\r\nEllen called and the girl appeared on the balcony.\r\n\r\n“Come down, dear, and help us now.”\r\n\r\nThere was the swish of a skirt and she seemed to clear the narrow\r\nstairs at a bound.\r\n\r\nIn a moment she stood before them flushed and excited.\r\n\r\n“What’ll I do--what’ll I do?” she cried.\r\n\r\nManning caught the eager longing for service in the tones of her soft\r\nrich voice. Whatever there might be of selfish purpose in the warp\r\nand woof of this adorable little creature, there was no thought of\r\nself-development.\r\n\r\n“Thank God for that!” he muttered to himself.\r\n\r\n“Sit down, dear,” Ellen said. “We want you to hear the story of our\r\nplay and tell us what you think of it.”\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid I don’t know enough.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t have to know anything, child,” Manning assured her. “Just\r\nsit there and enjoy it, if you can.”\r\n\r\nRose smiled her relief, switched her gingham skirts deftly and sat down.\r\n\r\n“Oh, is that all? I can do that, I’m sure.”\r\n\r\nEllen read the story of the play with all the feeling and delicate\r\nshading of thought which her fine voice could give to its words.\r\nManning slouched low in his chair and watched the face of the girl. A\r\nmore sensitive and exquisite mouth he had never imagined. In its lines\r\nit was the reproduction of Ellen’s, but about it lingered a charm the\r\nolder woman had never known. The slightest shade of wit registered\r\nwith unerring accuracy on the delicate lips. The slightest touch of\r\nexcitement in the story flashed from her eyes redoubled in intensity.\r\nHer whole personality radiated faith, worship, tenderness, and the\r\nspirit of self-effacement.\r\n\r\nManning felt the pangs of the old heart-hunger for a home and babies\r\nwith cruel force. The sight of her eager face fired his imagination. He\r\nforgot the story of the play and waked with a start as Rose leaped from\r\nher seat clapping her hands.\r\n\r\n“It’s beautiful, Aunt Ellen! It’s wonderful!”\r\n\r\n“You really think so, dear? What did you like about it?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I think the hero’s grand!”\r\n\r\nManning winked at Ellen.\r\n\r\n“And the heroine?”\r\n\r\n“She’s a little queer.”\r\n\r\nManning laughed and Ellen frowned.\r\n\r\n“But it’s so exciting. I almost screamed once. Did you hear me?”\r\n\r\nShe turned her question to Manning.\r\n\r\n“No, but I saw you crying.”\r\n\r\n“That wasn’t the time I was so excited--I cried three times.”\r\n\r\nManning smiled.\r\n\r\n“All right, little audience, we thank you very much for your kind\r\nassistance at our opening performance. I’ll send a machine down at once\r\nand you can give us three copies of this story to-night--will you?”\r\n\r\n“Will I? I’m just dying to get at it!”\r\n\r\nThe girl’s faith was contagious. The writers took new courage.\r\n\r\n“To-morrow we’ll begin the dialogue of the first act,” Ellen said\r\nenthusiastically.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELLEN READ THE STORY OF THE PLAY.]\r\n\r\n“Good. I’ll come early,” Manning responded.\r\n\r\nAnd all the way back to his apartment he saw the flashing, mobile,\r\nsensitive face of the miniature of Ellen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n                             THE DISCOVERY\r\n\r\n\r\nTHREE months of joyous work on the play followed swiftly, with the\r\nlittle spirit of joyous service fluttering from one desk to the other\r\nand back to her typewriter.\r\n\r\nThe days had not been without their hours of silent misery for Ellen.\r\nShe had lost the lover in the comrade and worker. Rose’s presence had,\r\nof course, made their love-life more difficult, but she couldn’t get\r\nout of her head the impression that somehow Manning had taken undue\r\nadvantage of it.\r\n\r\nTo reproach him was impossible. She would die sooner than humiliate\r\nherself in this abject way. A wife might nag her husband for\r\nneglect--they were bound by legal chains. She had the legal right to\r\nnag and he must submit. She was free. Manning was free. He was not\r\nexpected to guarantee the beat of his heart. She had not demanded it.\r\nShe could not expect it.\r\n\r\nShe had sought in vain for a trace of undue interest in Rose. His\r\nattitude toward the girl was scrupulously correct. When she thought of\r\nit carefully, it was painfully correct. He seemed to be on his guard.\r\nThat she decidedly did not like. It was the only ominous sign on which\r\nher morbid fancy could settle.\r\n\r\nThe more she watched, the less she found for suspicion. Her fears were\r\ngradually stilled.\r\n\r\nThe play was accepted, and the whirlwind of excitement on its\r\nproduction had reached the climax of the final dress rehearsal.\r\n\r\nThe night had been a storm of emotion such as Ellen had never dreamed\r\npossible on earth. She had supposed a dress rehearsal to be something\r\nof a formal orderly production of the finished play. She had found it\r\nthe culmination of all the troubles of director, stage hands, managers,\r\nproperty man, electricians, press agents, and authors.\r\n\r\nManning had generously disclaimed any knowledge of the technique of the\r\ndrama and insisted that Ellen should have full charge of the production.\r\n\r\nThe entire burden of the rehearsals, so far as changes demanded, fell\r\non her. She had fought fiercely with the director over an important\r\nchange which he had asked in the first act and had refused to budge an\r\ninch.\r\n\r\nThe managers were on hand to-night to sit in final judgment. When the\r\ncurtain came down on the first act, they pounced on the author with\r\nthe emphatic demand that the change be made in accordance with the\r\ndirector’s views.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact they were right, but with her lack of practical\r\nexperience she refused to see it.\r\n\r\nThe managers didn’t argue. They merely issued an order to the director.\r\n\r\n“Cut that scene out. It’s no good. It stops the whole action of the\r\nplay.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll never put on another play of mine!” Ellen snapped.\r\n\r\nThe senior manager smiled.\r\n\r\n“This is the play we’ve got our money in now, Miss West; we must get it\r\nright for the benefit of everybody concerned.”\r\n\r\nEllen was so enraged she sat in sullen silence for the next two acts\r\nand let them do exactly as they pleased. She had consigned the whole\r\nthing to the bottomless pit. And yet she sat fascinated as she watched\r\nfor the first time the puppets of her imagination live and move and\r\nbreathe before her eyes.\r\n\r\nIt was twelve o’clock before the fourth act was called. A break in the\r\nscene set caused a long delay, and while the noise of saw and hammer\r\nrang behind the curtain Ellen rose and wandered down the dimly lighted\r\nside-aisle to the rear of the orchestra.\r\n\r\nBehind the heavy curtains above the rear orchestra rail she heard the\r\nlow hum of conversation, and the unmistakable voice of Manning. She\r\nstopped and listened to be sure. There could be no mistake about it.\r\nThe other voice was a woman’s. She listened intently. It was soft and\r\nlow, but she couldn’t be mistaken. Rose was his companion.\r\n\r\nHer heart stood still in sudden anguish. How long had they been there?\r\nPerhaps two hours. She had been so infuriated over the demand of the\r\nmanagers and so overwhelmed with the sense of confusion, turmoil and\r\nexcitement she had lost the track of time.\r\n\r\nShe moved instinctively toward the curtain, unable to resist the desire\r\nto hear what they were saying. She reproached herself bitterly for the\r\ndisgraceful act, but her muscles refused to retreat.\r\n\r\nManning’s voice was tenderly modulated with unconscious effort.\r\n\r\nThe girl’s voice quivered with emotion.\r\n\r\n“But Aunt Ellen will be furious when she knows you struck your name off\r\nthe program,” she said.\r\n\r\n“And what of it, Miss Rose. It’s done, and she can’t undo it.”\r\n\r\nAt least he had said “Miss Rose”! Again she caught the conscious\r\ndetermination of restraint. There was no longer a question about the\r\nmeaning of her eager, tender tones. She was in love with Manning!\r\n\r\nEllen felt her knees suddenly give and her hand gripped the rail\r\nwithin two feet of their heads. She steadied herself and listened.\r\n\r\n“I know you only wrote the story,” Rose insisted, “but my auntie’s too\r\ngenerous to allow you to be denied the credit of half the work.”\r\n\r\n“You think I’ve done half?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Of course, auntie says so too.”\r\n\r\n“But I don’t know a thing about playwriting, child. It’s all Greek to\r\nme. I refuse to pose as a dramatist.”\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you write stories, then?” she suddenly asked in low eager\r\ntones.\r\n\r\nEllen could see the little soft hand unconsciously gripping his arm\r\nwith the question.\r\n\r\n“You think I could?” he asked carelessly.\r\n\r\n“I know you could! You could write a big novel if you tried.”\r\n\r\n“Think so?”\r\n\r\n“I know it.”\r\n\r\n“Would you do the typewriting for me?”\r\n\r\n“If auntie will let me. I’m sure she would. She’ll feel terribly when\r\nshe finds out your name’s not on the program.”\r\n\r\nEllen could hear no more. She felt her way through the darkness and\r\ndown the aisle to her seat again.\r\n\r\nThe play faded from her brain. The fourth act was called and played to\r\nthe finish without a single scene or word reaching her.\r\n\r\nThe tragedy of her own life blinded her in sickening, vivid flashes.\r\n\r\nRose could not dream of the truth of her relations to Manning. Her love\r\nhad been the normal development of their daily association under such\r\nconditions. His high sense of honor and loyalty had held him from word\r\nor deed that might betray his feelings.\r\n\r\nIt couldn’t be possible that he had really fallen in love with this\r\nsimple child! But four years had passed since their mystic wedding\r\nnight in the log cottage on the cliff. They had their quarrels and\r\ndifferences as all people of positive personality must in daily contact\r\nwith one another. But this----\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear God, no--no--no!” she sobbed in anguish. “It can’t be\r\ntrue--it just can’t!”\r\n\r\nAnd yet the longer she thought of it, the more probable the thing\r\nbecame. His ideal of home and children had been a deathless passion\r\nfrom the first. Her failure to satisfy this passion had been the secret\r\nof their quarrels and unhappiness. Rose had suddenly appeared the image\r\nof his first love, born again in vivid fascinating youth, with every\r\nbeat of her heart keeping time to his dream.\r\n\r\nHer heart sank in panic. How could he help falling in love with her?\r\nShe was young, she was beautiful, she was sweet and unselfish. And her\r\nideal was the old-fashioned one of passionate self-sacrifice.\r\n\r\nAnd yet when she recalled their conversation no word of love had\r\nbeen spoken or hinted between them. Why had she leaped at this wild\r\nconclusion?\r\n\r\nShe pulled herself together.\r\n\r\nShe would watch and wait developments. To send her niece home was\r\nunthinkable. She had become a part of her own life. She loved her\r\ndearly. To confess her fears to the man on whom she had forced a free\r\nalliance was equally impossible.\r\n\r\nAt one o’clock the rehearsal closed. She said good-night to Manning in\r\na stupor.\r\n\r\n“I’m too tired to talk, dear,” she whispered to him wearily. “Don’t\r\ncome home with me. Rose and I will walk alone and get some fresh air.”\r\n\r\n“All right, to-morrow night, then, for the great event! I’ll meet you\r\nhere at seven-thirty.”\r\n\r\nRose chattered for half a dozen blocks in endless, joyful excitement.\r\n\r\nShe paused at last, conscious of something wrong.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter, honey?” she questioned, anxiously trying to peer\r\ninto Ellen’s eyes. She had just passed her twenty-first birthday\r\nand had begun in moments of stress to use the old Southern word of\r\nendearment to express anxiety or tenderness.\r\n\r\n“Just worn to a frazzle, dear,” her aunt replied. “I’m so sore and worn\r\nout with that miserable rehearsal. It was the very worst we ever had. I\r\nfeel as if I could die with a sense of joyous relief.”\r\n\r\nThe girl’s grip tightened on her arm.\r\n\r\n“I was so scared for a minute. I was afraid you were sick.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll be all right to-morrow, honey,” Ellen answered, smiling wanly.\r\n\r\nRose was quick to match the imitation of her pet name.\r\n\r\n“You don’t mind if I call you ‘Honey,’ do you?” she asked timidly. “You\r\nknow how I love you!”\r\n\r\n“Of course not, silly child.”\r\n\r\nShe laid her hand tenderly on Rose’s.\r\n\r\n“I love you, too, my sweet little miniature. I just haven’t learned to\r\nbe as happy as you are.”\r\n\r\nThrough a night of soul-searching questions Ellen faced the tragedy\r\nwhose shadows she felt creeping closer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n                             BURIED ALIVE\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR Ellen West the première of her first play was an event of minor\r\nimportance, completely submerged in the flood of misery which swept her\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nThe audience received the piece coldly. Its brilliant dialogue made no\r\nheadway against their indifference to the theme of social propaganda.\r\nThe fashionable crowd came to be amused. They resented instruction.\r\n\r\nEllen saw the fatal notice posted at eleven o’clock on the bulletin\r\nboard announcing the close at the end of the customary two weeks. It\r\nwas a matter of supreme indifference to her whether it closed or ran\r\nten years.\r\n\r\nRose gripped her arm and stared at the notice.\r\n\r\n“What are they going to close it for, auntie?”\r\n\r\n“It’s a failure, my dear.”\r\n\r\n“Failure,” she gasped.\r\n\r\n“A ‘frost,’ the manager kindly told me.”\r\n\r\n“Why, they laughed and cheered.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, child, we had some personal friends out front who did the best\r\nthey could for us.”\r\n\r\nRose was the only one of the three who took the failure seriously.\r\n\r\nManning’s spirits rebounded immediately, although he had thought a\r\nsuccess assured. He had planned an elaborate supper at the Astor in\r\ncelebration. In reality, he meant that the two authors should give the\r\nsupper in honor of their little typewriter girl, whose joy would be\r\ntenfold greater than theirs.\r\n\r\n“We’ll celebrate anyhow!” he announced cheerfully as he read the\r\nbulletin.\r\n\r\n“I’d rather not,” Ellen protested.\r\n\r\n“Nonsense; come along, the supper’s all ordered.”\r\n\r\nEllen shook her head.\r\n\r\n“Please, auntie, I’ve never been to the Astor.”\r\n\r\nThere was no help for it. She couldn’t refuse Rose’s eager plea.\r\n\r\nThe throng in the restaurant depressed Ellen’s spirits. Every table\r\nwas crowded with gay theatre parties. The chatter and laughing was\r\ncontinuous. The music seemed a double mockery. Her heart was lead.\r\n\r\nThe thing that puzzled and still further alarmed her was the bubbling\r\ngaiety with which Manning took the failure. There was something\r\nsinister about it. No man could throw months of hard work into the\r\nwaste basket with a laugh unless he had some secret joy in his heart.\r\n\r\nShe watched his attitude toward Rose. His face was a mask of friendly\r\nconventional propriety. She studied the tones of his voice. In not a\r\nsingle word or accent did he betray the slightest interest beyond that\r\nwhich an author might feel in the disappointment of his typewriter girl\r\nover the failure of his work.\r\n\r\nThe supper was finished and he had lighted a cigar before the\r\nannouncement came that took her breath.\r\n\r\n“You wonder why I’m gay to-night?” he asked Ellen.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve something more exciting to think about than our failure. I don’t\r\nknow the trick of the play anyhow. But I’ve always had a sneaking idea\r\nthat I could write a novel----”\r\n\r\nHe paused. Ellen’s heart fairly stopped its beat and Rose’s eyes danced\r\nwith excitement.\r\n\r\n“The whole story flashed on me last night after the rehearsal,” he\r\nwent on eagerly. “I worked out the plot in two hours, went to bed and\r\nslept soundly. I got up this morning with the whole thing a living\r\ninspiration. I can see my characters as clearly as if I’d known them a\r\nlifetime. I can write it in two months. The die is cast--the Rubicon\r\ncrossed. I quit the soul-racking grind of a daily newspaper to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“Give up your position?” Ellen gasped.\r\n\r\n“Without a sigh. I’ve saved enough to live two years. The worst that\r\ncould happen would be a failure. I can always make a living on a paper\r\nif I have to. But what’s the use of living a slave’s life if you can be\r\nfree? Why crawl if you can fly? I believe I can fly.”\r\n\r\n“I just know it,” Rose broke in enthusiastically.\r\n\r\n“You’re very foolish to give up your big job on Brown’s paper until you\r\ntry your wings,” Ellen observed evenly.\r\n\r\n“I tried them last night and they worked. All I need is the chance to\r\nconcentrate every ounce of my brains on this one job until it’s done. I\r\nshall resent the necessity of eating and sleeping. I suppose I’ll have\r\nto yield a point there. But on all others, I shall be adamant--no mail,\r\nno telephone calls, no visitors, no communication with the world until\r\nI find my pathway among the stars!”\r\n\r\nEllen’s eyes flashed with anger. Rose’s face was a curious mixture of\r\nelation and disappointment.\r\n\r\n“How’ll you get the manuscript to me for the typewriter?” she faltered.\r\n\r\n“Send it by a messenger from my secret den.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I’ll clear out of my apartment to shake the boys. I’ll take a\r\nbare room in a good boarding-house, where I can have my meals served\r\nalone on my desk and bury myself there for two months. I’ll emerge\r\nwith the finished book in my hands or I’ll die in the effort.”\r\n\r\nRose clapped her hands and laughed.\r\n\r\n“You can do it! I know you can; don’t you believe it, auntie?”\r\n\r\n“Such things have been done, my dear,” was the grave answer.\r\n\r\n“And you begin to-morrow?” she added.\r\n\r\n“To-morrow at ten o’clock. I’ve already found my den and given up my\r\njob.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, my, isn’t it exciting!” Rose exclaimed.\r\n\r\nEllen felt a hot tear dimming her eyes in spite of her iron will. The\r\nsubtle cruelty of his scheme of announcing his break with her for two\r\nmonths before Rose, where protest or argument would be impossible,\r\nfairly stunned her. To argue before Rose was, of course, out of the\r\nquestion. To argue at all under such circumstances her pride would\r\nforbid. On this he had reckoned with absolute certainty.\r\n\r\nThis sudden sweeping inspiration might be a fact, or it might be the\r\nsimplest subterfuge through which to break their love relations for two\r\nmonths. If he had waked suddenly to the realization that he had wearied\r\nof her and fallen in love with her niece, his inner sense of honor and\r\ndecency would make a break inevitable. He could have hit on no safer\r\nor more delicate scheme.\r\n\r\nShe could but admire his ingenuity. Yet nothing could still the\r\ndull, suffocating ache within. Submission to his voluntary exile was\r\ninevitable. She felt herself choking for a moment, recovered herself,\r\nand spoke with gentle irony:\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid Rose and I will miss you very much.”\r\n\r\n“Terribly!” Rose added.\r\n\r\n“It’ll be done in a jiffy, and I’ll emerge an author.”\r\n\r\nHis faith was so strong and so genuine Ellen caught its contagion. He\r\ncertainly meant it. She knew him too well--knew the processes of his\r\nmind too intimately to doubt now that he was in dead earnest.\r\n\r\nShe reproached herself for her doubts at all. Had he not proven his\r\nsincerity by resigning his position and risking all on the venture?\r\n\r\nShe tried to smile an honest wish for success when she took his hand to\r\nsay good-night as he handed them into a cab. She still half hoped that\r\nhe would accompany them home and steal a chance for a word alone. He\r\nmade no sign and she knew that he wished to avoid it.\r\n\r\n“You know that I wish you the greatest success of your life in this mad\r\nventure. I shall await your return from the grave.”\r\n\r\n“Send me the manuscript as fast as you can,” Rose said. “I’ll be just\r\ncrazy to read it! And I’ll see it first, won’t I? I’ll let auntie read\r\nthe nice clean copy.”\r\n\r\n“And send it back to me; two copies, won’t you, as fast as it’s done,\r\nchapter by chapter?”\r\n\r\nHis voice was casually business-like. If he were in love with Rose, he\r\nwas a past master in the control of his emotions.\r\n\r\nEllen pressed his hand with a little grip of parting anguish and sank\r\nback to her seat in the shadows in time to prevent his seeing the tears\r\nthat came in spite of her effort at self-control. She brushed them away\r\nbefore Rose could notice her emotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n                             THE SURRENDER\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE reaction of anger following Manning’s voluntary burial in his book\r\nsustained Ellen’s spirits. Through pride every instinct of her strong\r\ncharacter came to the rescue. By every law of the new creed of life\r\nshe had achieved an individual personality. She had refused to merge\r\nherself or submerge herself in man. She summoned every energy of her\r\nbeing now to battle for her principles.\r\n\r\nFor two weeks she resolutely put Manning out of her thoughts. She wrote\r\nwith renewed inspiration on her favorite themes.\r\n\r\nShe refused Rose’s enthusiastic appeals to read his manuscript. She\r\nrefused to touch it.\r\n\r\n“Please read just this one chapter, auntie,” the enthusiastic young\r\ntypist urged one day. “It’s wonderful. I’ve just cried my eyes out over\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“No, dear,” was the firm reply. “I prefer to wait and read the finished\r\nbook; I’ll enjoy it more.”\r\n\r\nShe made up her mind never to read it, unless----\r\n\r\n“Bah!” she cried in disgust; “I’m always making idiotic conditions to\r\nevery fine resolution, unless, of course, he comes with true repentance\r\nfor his brutal cruelty and apologizes.”\r\n\r\nShe paused and smiled bitterly. She couldn’t imagine him apologizing\r\nagain. He had gotten out of that habit. As he had grown in strength of\r\ncharacter and found the poise which success among his equals brought,\r\nsomething had hardened inside. She dismissed the idea angrily.\r\n\r\nShe was watching Rose work with tireless energy. Her nimble fingers\r\nfairly flew over the keys of the machine. She rarely paused to correct\r\nan error. She read his scrawling penciled manuscript with curiously\r\naccurate instinct.\r\n\r\nShe had finished the copy on hand and placed it in the big square\r\nManila envelope for the messenger, who arrived daily at twelve o’clock.\r\nShe was writing a note to place inside.\r\n\r\nEllen’s heart gave a sudden leap. They were evidently carrying on a\r\ndaily exchange of letters by the messenger boy!\r\n\r\nShe rose and stood beside the girl’s desk.\r\n\r\n“Writing him a love-letter, dear?” she asked calmly.\r\n\r\nRose started and blushed.\r\n\r\n“I’ll show you his note to me,” she answered eagerly.\r\n\r\nShe rummaged among the papers in the drawer and drew out a crumpled\r\npiece of cheap manuscript paper on which Manning had scrawled:\r\n\r\n “Thanks, dear little Typewriter, for your beautiful copy. I can’t\r\n believe my eyes when I see what you make out of the awful stuff I send\r\n you. Sometimes I can’t read it myself. You must have X-rays in your\r\n eyes to read it so clearly. I congratulate you and I thank you.\r\n\r\n                                                              MANNING.”\r\n\r\n“And this is what I’ve written in reply.” She handed her aunt the sheet\r\nof paper on which she had been writing.\r\n\r\nDEAR MR. AUTHOR:\r\n\r\n You make me very happy with your flattering note. Please write a\r\n little plainer and I can go much faster.\r\n\r\n                                                       YOUR TYPEWRITER.\r\n\r\nEllen smiled when she had finished the harmless epistle.\r\n\r\nRose searched her face for the meaning of her smile.\r\n\r\n“Do you think that word ‘flattering’ is too bold?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll strike it out if you think so?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think he will misinterpret it, dear,” she answered gravely.\r\n\r\n“All right; I’ll put it with the manuscript, then.”\r\n\r\nShe folded and placed her note in the big envelope containing the\r\nmanuscript.\r\n\r\nEllen watched her tenderly.\r\n\r\n“You shouldn’t fold it.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“He’s so rushed and absorbed in work he’ll yank the manuscript out and\r\nnever see it.”\r\n\r\n“How’ll I fix it?” she asked anxiously.\r\n\r\n“Unfold it and fasten the full page with a clip across the manuscript,\r\nand then he can’t neglect your message.”\r\n\r\n“That’s so, isn’t it?”\r\n\r\nShe hurriedly did as Ellen had told her and just finished as the\r\nmessenger boy arrived with a new chapter.\r\n\r\n“Here you are, boy,” Rose said briskly. “And don’t you lose it now;\r\nI’ve got a note in this one.”\r\n\r\nThe boy threw her a look of pain and extended his slip for her\r\nsignature without condescending to words.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to discover in the two brief messages the slightest\r\ntrace of the love-affair she had feared, and yet the fact that she had\r\ndiscovered this underground correspondence made Ellen miserable. All\r\nthe strength of her anger melted.\r\n\r\nHe had pushed her out of his life as a troublesome intruder. This\r\nenthusiastic, helpful, mere child he had taken into the intimacy of his\r\ndaily thought. And she was helping him. That was what cut. The girl was\r\ngiving her soul and body in utter self-sacrifice, while his chosen mate\r\nstood by and watched in helpless misery.\r\n\r\nThere was something radically wrong with her theory of a free alliance!\r\nFor the first time she faced it squarely. Her world of ideals and\r\ntheories began to crumble. The ground beneath her feet gave way and the\r\nshock was an emotional earthquake.\r\n\r\nShe had lost the way of life in her search for self-development! This\r\nchild was finding it before her eyes in the old-time worn way of\r\nself-sacrifice. There might be yet time to repair the tragic blunder.\r\n\r\nShe made up her mind. She would throw pride to the winds. She would\r\nwait in patient anguish until Manning had finished his book and then\r\nsurrender--unconditionally--joyfully.\r\n\r\nThe thought of it gave her courage. She would redouble her efforts at\r\nwriting. Her editorial work was far in advance of the needs of the\r\nmagazine. She was specially thankful for this just now. She was not\r\nin the mood for radical propaganda. She would devote herself with\r\nfurious energy to the writing of a series of short-stories which she\r\nhad planned for years. Work was her only refuge from madness until she\r\ncould see Manning, tell him her suffering and make the last effort to\r\nsave herself from wreck.\r\n\r\nThe blackest days of life she had spent since his disappearance. If he\r\nhad placed a continent or an ocean between them she could have borne\r\nthe separation with philosophy. There was something of the stoic in the\r\nrock foundation of her character. The thing that had all but driven her\r\nmad was the fact that he was perhaps within a stone’s throw of his old\r\napartment on Thirty-first Street and yet he had completely shut her\r\nfrom his life.\r\n\r\nThe decision to surrender brought relief from the strain of an anguish\r\nwhich had been unbearable. She would surprise him with the complete\r\nacceptance of his views of life. She would make her surrender so\r\ncomplete, so tenderly appealing, no shadow could ever again darken the\r\nhome they would build.\r\n\r\nShe began to wonder at the supreme folly of her self-centered program.\r\nNo wonder she had failed to hold him! She ought to have failed. Thank\r\nGod, she had awakened in time!\r\n\r\nThe plan of complete reconciliation once settled in her mind, she\r\nworked on her stories with untiring zeal. She must finish the whole\r\nseries of six by the time he completed his manuscript. She set her head\r\nto the task with the determination to show him her manuscript the day\r\nhe would assemble his.\r\n\r\nShe finished two days before he sent his last chapter to Rose, and\r\nspent the time in leisurely revision and retouching. The hours were not\r\nwithout their tension of anxiety and foreboding. She wondered if he\r\nwould call. He must, of course. They had parted in good humor. There\r\nhad been no quarrel; no harsh words to regret.\r\n\r\nRose’s final verdict on his book had profoundly excited her.\r\n\r\n“It’s _great_, Aunt Ellen!” she cried in breathless excitement.\r\n“I’ve cried my eyes out the past week. It’s the most beautiful book I\r\never read in all my life! It’s so real, you can just see and feel the\r\npeople in it.”\r\n\r\nUnless she had lost all sense of proportion in her enthusiasm, it would\r\ncertainly make a hit. Such a verdict from a girl of twenty-one meant a\r\nsensational success.\r\n\r\nHe would probably take it to the publishers the day following and call\r\nthat evening.\r\n\r\nThree days passed without a word. It was ominous! Rose was evidently\r\nsurprised and shocked; too surprised and shocked to ask her aunt why he\r\nstayed away. She had been present when he announced his plan of work\r\nand his complete isolation for two months. She, too, had supposed that\r\nhe would call at once on the completion of his task.\r\n\r\nEllen caught the look of anxiety in the girl’s face and couldn’t keep\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid Mr. Manning is ill, dear,” she said anxiously.\r\n\r\n“Do you think so?” Rose whispered.\r\n\r\n“I’ll call up his apartment.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, do.”\r\n\r\nShe rang his number and waited in breathless silence while some one\r\nfumbled the receiver at the other end.\r\n\r\nA strange voice answered.\r\n\r\n“Yes, this is Mr. Manning’s apartment.”\r\n\r\n“May I speak to him, please?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Manning is not here.”\r\n\r\n“Who is this, please?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Bates of the publishing house of Alfred Bates & Company. I have\r\njust packed him off in my car for a month’s rest at my country-place at\r\nLakewood.”\r\n\r\n“Was--he--ill?” Ellen gasped.\r\n\r\n“Quite,” was the frank reply. “He has suffered a complete nervous\r\ncollapse from overwork. The doctor has forbidden him to see a friend,\r\nwrite or receive a letter without his permission. A trained nurse was\r\nsent with him.”\r\n\r\nEllen recovered herself with a desperate effort and spoke evenly:\r\n\r\n“This is Miss West, Mr. Bates. I am terribly shocked. My niece did the\r\ntypewriting of his book. You know, perhaps, that we collaborated in a\r\nplay this winter.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, Miss West. I’m glad you called. He was talking of you and\r\nyour niece in his fever and seemed greatly distressed at leaving\r\nwithout seeing you. We managed to complete our contracts for the\r\nimmediate publication of his book.”\r\n\r\n“You’ve accepted it, then?”\r\n\r\n“We seized it within forty-eight hours after we saw it. We are doing a\r\nmost unusual thing. We are so sure of the sensation it will produce,\r\nwe have ordered a first edition of fifty thousand copies. His fame and\r\nfortune are assured.”\r\n\r\n“His illness will not be serious?”\r\n\r\n“A month of absolute rest will put him on his feet again.”\r\n\r\n“You’re sure?”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely. The doctor says he will be all right sooner, but he will\r\nkeep him quiet a month if he has to chain him.”\r\n\r\n“He can’t receive a letter from any one?”\r\n\r\n“The doctor has sternly forbidden it.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you.”\r\n\r\nShe slowly hung up the receiver and faced the tense look of her niece.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter with him, auntie?” she faltered.\r\n\r\n“He’s very ill, dear; a nervous breakdown from overwork.”\r\n\r\n“He’ll get well, though,” she said firmly.\r\n\r\n“The doctor says so; Yes, and Bates & Co. have accepted his book.”\r\n\r\n“Of course; I knew they would.”\r\n\r\n“They say it will be an enormous sensation.”\r\n\r\n“Of course.”\r\n\r\nThere was a far-off look in the young eyes that was uncanny and Ellen\r\ncaught it with a feeling of dumb misery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n                              THE REFUSAL\r\n\r\n\r\nTHREE desolate winter months passed and still Manning remained under\r\nthe doctor’s care. Not a line had been received from him. Ellen’s heart\r\nsank at the bitter thought. Surely he might have dared a doctor’s\r\norders and sent a word to say that she had not been forgotten.\r\n\r\nShe kept in touch with him through Bates, the head of his publishing\r\nhouse. She called his telephone and asked boldly and directly about his\r\nhealth. She had ceased to care what he thought, although he was the\r\nmost conventional of New England churchmen.\r\n\r\nAn occasional letter from Lucy Sheldon barely mentioned Manning’s\r\nillness and always with the certain assurance of his early recovery.\r\n\r\nEllen resolutely closed her eyes to the dumb misery of her niece. She\r\nrefused to recognize the possibility of the thing she feared. She would\r\nknow only the depth and despair of her own love and the resolution to\r\nfight her way back into Manning’s heart and life. There was no such\r\nword as fail. The strength of this resolution gave her the courage to\r\nfight despair.\r\n\r\nShe stood at her window and watched the snow swirl in blinding sheets\r\nagainst the big building opposite in the fiercest storm of the winter.\r\nIt had broken on the swelling buds of the trees late in March. For\r\ntwenty-four hours it had raged with unabated fury. The snow had piled\r\nin huge drifts against the buildings on the east side of the avenue and\r\ncovered the square in white fantastic hills, ravines and valleys.\r\n\r\nThe tempest soothed the tumult of her heart. She watched the swaying\r\ntrees and the brave traveller here and there battling with the fierce\r\nwinds in a pensive and passive mood. What was the use of standing stiff\r\nand straight to take the lash of the storm? It was better to bend as\r\nthe swaying branches of those elms and let it pass. It must pass. All\r\nsorrows must pass. The sun must shine to-morrow or the next day.\r\n\r\nThrough the swirling clouds of snow she saw emerging the figure of a\r\ntiny messenger boy battling against the storm. He was crossing the\r\nsquare toward the avenue.\r\n\r\nInstantly she leaped at the idea that he was bringing a message to her\r\nthrough the blinding mists of the snow. The idea became a certainty\r\nwhen he crossed the avenue and sought the shelter of the western side.\r\nShe sprang to her door, opened it, and leaned over the stair rail. Her\r\nhands were trembling.\r\n\r\n“Silly fool!” she muttered.\r\n\r\nNot a sound came from below save the dull roar of the wind in the\r\nvestibule at the entrance on the level of the street. He wouldn’t ring\r\nthe old-fashioned bell. The front door was never locked in the daytime.\r\nHer heart sank. He had passed, of course. The front door suddenly\r\nopened and a gust of freezing air rushed upward. She drank it as wine.\r\nHer cheeks flushed and she laughed with nervous joy. She waited for\r\na moment and saw the little half-frozen blue figure trudging up the\r\nstairs, pulling on the rail as if exhausted.\r\n\r\n“Up here, boy!” she cried encouragingly.\r\n\r\n“Miss Ellen West?” he called.\r\n\r\n“Yes; hurry, please!”\r\n\r\nHe stopped to rest.\r\n\r\n“My Gawd,” he wailed, “I’m a hurryin’ all I can. I’m froze ter death.\r\nI’m plum dead.”\r\n\r\nEllen ran down the stairs to meet him, took the telegram and read it.\r\n\r\n “Will arrive New York at eleven a.m. to-morrow morning and call\r\n immediately.\r\n\r\n                                                              MANNING.”\r\n\r\nShe felt herself sway uncertainly for an instant and caught the rail in\r\ntime to steady her nerves. The boy had seated himself on the stairs,\r\nindifferent to passing events. He was so tired and cold nothing\r\nmattered.\r\n\r\nEllen saw the crouching, shivering bundle at her feet, roused herself\r\nand drew him after her into the warm room. His face was dirty and his\r\neyes bleared, but he was beautiful to her dreaming eyes. He had brought\r\nglad tidings! She gave him a cup of hot coffee, stuffed him with\r\ndoughnuts, and sent him down the steps whistling.\r\n\r\nShe took time to compose herself before announcing to Rose the news.\r\nTo have permitted the girl to see her silly tears of joy, her flushed\r\ncheeks and trembling hands would have been an abject confession. She\r\nshivered at the thought. Fortunately, Rose was in her room and had not\r\nheard the messenger boy enter.\r\n\r\nShe climbed the stairs to the balcony and placed her hand on the door\r\nknob, paused suddenly and decided to call her message without entering.\r\nShe was ashamed to confess her cowardice, but in her heart of hearts\r\nshe was afraid her niece might betray the secret which she had sworn to\r\nherself could not exist.\r\n\r\nShe gripped the knob firmly and called:\r\n\r\n“Rose, dear!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, honey.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve just received a telegram from Mr. Manning.”\r\n\r\n“He’s--not--dead?”\r\n\r\n“Well, he couldn’t wire us if he were.”\r\n\r\n“He’s coming?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; to-morrow at eleven o’clock.”\r\n\r\nThere was no answer; only a faint little smothered cry.\r\n\r\n“Don’t stop your work now, dear. Do more than usual so you can take\r\nto-morrow morning off.”\r\n\r\n“Yes’m,” came the low answer.\r\n\r\nIn spite of her resolve not to know what Rose really felt toward\r\nManning, Ellen caught herself listening eagerly to every accent of her\r\nanswers. In no way did she reveal anything. The excitement she had\r\nshown would be perfectly natural under the circumstances. Her interest\r\nin Manning as his typewriter would account for it, to say nothing of\r\nthe fact that he was her aunt’s collaborator and best friend.\r\n\r\nBesides, the book which she had typed for him had made a sensation. The\r\nfirst edition of a hundred thousand copies had been sold and a second\r\nedition twice as large was on the press. His royalties from these two\r\neditions would be ninety thousand dollars. His name was on every lip in\r\nthe world of letters. His fame was already nation-wide.\r\n\r\nWhatever her personal attitude toward Manning, the child would feel the\r\ndeepest interest always in his career. Ellen not only refused to face\r\nthe possibility of her niece’s love; she had convinced herself that the\r\nidea was absurd.\r\n\r\nAt eleven o’clock next morning she seized her telephone and called the\r\nPennsylvania station. The train from Lakewood was twenty minutes late\r\non account of the storm.\r\n\r\n“Go back to your studies, dear,” she said gently to Rose. “I’ll call\r\nyou when he arrives. The train will be more than an hour late to-day.\r\nThe snow is drifting.”\r\n\r\n“All right, honey,” was the cheerful reply.\r\n\r\nThe girl had a beautiful spirit. To know her was to love her. For just\r\nan instant an ugly wish flashed through Ellen’s heart. Why couldn’t she\r\nhave been a little more selfish and mean? She dismissed it with scorn\r\nfor her own weakness.\r\n\r\nShe had sent Rose back to her studies, not because she really believed\r\nthe train would be an hour late, but because she must have a few\r\nminutes alone with Manning. And it must be at once. It would be\r\nunendurable to sit quietly before Rose and talk conventionally with the\r\nstorm raging within her soul.\r\n\r\nAt twenty minutes past eleven she heard his footfall on the stairs.\r\nShe leaped to her feet. The train had made up time. Could she control\r\nherself? She must. To throw herself into his arms was her first\r\nimpulse. To have him release himself would be the last straw. It\r\nwouldn’t do. She must give him the assurance first of her conversion\r\nto his ideals--of her complete acceptance of his way in life. She\r\nmust take time to clear all differences from their pathway. She must\r\nremember that he was still free by an act of her own will. Rose could\r\nnot hear their conversation in the living-room below.\r\n\r\nWith an effort she steadied herself for the meeting and opened the\r\ndoor. The shock of his appearance unnerved her. He extended his hand\r\nwith an uncertain movement, as if dizzy, and his step was shuffling.\r\nHis eyes were widely distended and sunk deep in his projecting\r\nforehead. They burned with a feverishly bright light.\r\n\r\nShe tried to speak and couldn’t. She held his hand tightly and assisted\r\nhim to a chair.\r\n\r\n“I really shouldn’t have come to-day,” he apologized. “The doctor\r\nrefused permission. I told him to go to the devil and I came to New\r\nYork.”\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid it was unwise,” she faltered.\r\n\r\n“I had to come. I had to see you for a few minutes.”\r\n\r\nEllen’s lips quivered.\r\n\r\n“They tell me,” he went on quickly, “that I must go further south for a\r\nlong stay----”\r\n\r\nHe paused in apparent embarrassment.\r\n\r\nEllen looked into his eyes with tender yearning.\r\n\r\nThere was an absent stare in them that saw nothing.\r\n\r\n“Before you say anything,” she began in low tones, “I’ve something to\r\ntell you. In the long hours of abject misery through which I’ve passed\r\nsince I lost you I’ve been born again--born of the spirit, I think. I\r\nhave ceased to desire self-development. My one wish has been and is to\r\nhelp you. I have changed my views of life. I have returned to the old\r\ncreed of woman’s complete merging in the life of her mate. I’ll marry\r\nyou now, dear love-man, if you will ask me.”\r\n\r\nHer voice had sunk to a whisper in her last words. He sat as if in a\r\ntrance, his eyes shining with a strange brilliance. She waited until it\r\nwas impossible to endure the silence longer.\r\n\r\n“Did you hear me?” she inquired gently.\r\n\r\nHe smiled wanly.\r\n\r\n“Yes, dear, I heard you with an unearthly distinctness. I can’t realize\r\nthat it is you who say this to me. I seem to be another man looking\r\ndown on the scene----”\r\n\r\nHe paused and drew a deep breath.\r\n\r\n“You see, it’s too late for us now.”\r\n\r\nA cry of anguish came in spite of her effort.\r\n\r\n“I must be frank, mustn’t I?”\r\n\r\n“Yes--yes--go on; it’s the only way,” she urged.\r\n\r\n“In you and me, habit has become fixed. Habit is life--character is the\r\nsum total of our habits. We began all wrong. We kept open shop from\r\nthe first. There was nothing fixed, nothing settled, except the one\r\nthing that could always keep things unsettled--our freedom! Life was\r\none of continuous unrest. Impatience, turmoil, quarrelling, bickering,\r\nand suspicion was the only air we could breathe because we were\r\nfree--and freedom is a challenge to progressive new relations. It would\r\nbe a fatal mistake for us now to attempt the old régime. It could only\r\nend in disappointment and unhappiness for us both.”\r\n\r\nShe lifted her hand.\r\n\r\n“Please. It is unnecessary for you to say more.”\r\n\r\nThe old imperious pride was slowly asserting itself. He knew that it\r\nwould if he were frank. He had made up his mind to be brutally frank.\r\nHe was glad she had rallied so quickly.\r\n\r\n“You came, then, to tell me this before you left for the South?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you.”\r\n\r\nHe rose with an effort.\r\n\r\n“You will go so soon?” she asked coldly.\r\n\r\n“I promised the doctor to take the first train back. I am to leave for\r\nthe South to-night.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll call Rose.”\r\n\r\n“Please don’t!” he said quickly.\r\n\r\n“She will be dreadfully disappointed.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know,” he answered thoughtfully, “but I’m not equal to the task\r\nof meeting others to-day. I came only to see you.”\r\n\r\nThere was a tone of finality to his voice that angered her.\r\n\r\n“I understand,” she responded indifferently.\r\n\r\nShe accompanied him to the door before she thought of the frozen\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\n“You must let me call you a cab.”\r\n\r\n“Mine is waiting,” he said.\r\n\r\nHer cheeks flushed. He had planned the final break with her in cold\r\nblood! She closed the door without extending her hand or uttering a\r\nword. She heard him hesitate a moment as if shocked by her rudeness.\r\nAnd then he slowly descended the stairs.\r\n\r\nShe turned into the room with firm step, her head erect.\r\n\r\nThe blow she had received was so brutal, so cruel, it was incredible.\r\nHer mind had refused to grasp its full meaning at first. She only dimly\r\nrealized it yet. Soul and body rose in fierce rebellion.\r\n\r\n“Deserted!” she laughed bitterly.\r\n\r\nIt was bitter, but it was good medicine. It was the tonic needed to\r\nsave her from collapse. She thanked him for saving her. She would lift\r\nup her head now and go her way. If the world sneered, what matter? She\r\nwould live her own life in her own way.\r\n\r\nShe saw a copy of his novel on her desk. She threw it across the room,\r\nstruck a vase and shattered it.\r\n\r\nThe noise brought Rose to the balcony.\r\n\r\n“What was that? Has he come, auntie?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; come down!”\r\n\r\nRose approached with an expression of childlike bewilderment.\r\n\r\n“He has come?”\r\n\r\n“And gone.”\r\n\r\n“Gone?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And you didn’t let me know,” she gasped.\r\n\r\n“I started to call you and he stopped me.” Her voice was hard and cold.\r\nIts chill struck the girl’s heart.\r\n\r\n“He stopped you?” she repeated in wonder.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Said he didn’t want to see anyone. He is a very distinguished man now,\r\nhoney.”\r\n\r\nThe girl’s lips moved as if to speak. She staggered and crumpled on the\r\nfloor at Ellen’s feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n                            THE CONFESSION\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR a long while after she had regained consciousness Rose remained\r\nsilent. And then she smiled wanly at her aunt and murmured little\r\napologies.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what came over me,” she kept on repeating. “I never felt\r\nbetter in my life. My knees just gave way and down I went.”\r\n\r\nEllen stroked her hand gently.\r\n\r\n“I never fainted in my life before!” she went on. “What could have made\r\nme do it, honey?”\r\n\r\nEllen’s eyes searched hers for a moment in silence and they were\r\nlowered.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know, dear; but I think you do. Can’t you tell me?”\r\n\r\nThe little hand gripped hers fiercely, her eyes closed and the tears\r\npushed through the trembling lids. Ellen waited until the paroxysm\r\npassed, bent and kissed the quivering lips. Two arms stole round her\r\nneck and held her fast until the tears came to her own eyes.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I will,” Rose murmured; “I’ve got to tell you or die. Oh,\r\nauntie----”\r\n\r\nShe paused and flushed scarlet.\r\n\r\n“I’m in love with him. I’ve worshipped him from the minute we met in\r\nthis room. I’ve lived only to see him, to hear his voice--to know that\r\nI could be in his life.”\r\n\r\n“And he loves you?” she asked evenly.\r\n\r\n“I know that he does.”\r\n\r\n“He has told you?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“How do you know?”\r\n\r\n“In a hundred things that he did. In the way he spoke to me--the caress\r\nin his voice--and----”\r\n\r\nShe blushed and paused again.\r\n\r\n“And the way he looked at me. He didn’t need to say any words.”\r\n\r\n“But why didn’t he tell you?”\r\n\r\n“Something seemed to hold him back. Something I couldn’t understand. He\r\ntried to tell me and couldn’t. But I thought he would. I waited, and\r\nloved him more and more.”\r\n\r\n“Forget him, dear.”\r\n\r\n“I never can!”\r\n\r\n“Many a woman has said that before.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to live without him. Why should he treat me like this,\r\nauntie, dear? I’m not ugly!”\r\n\r\n“You’re beautiful, my child.”\r\n\r\n“I’m nearly as old as he is. He’s not more than ten years older; that’s\r\nno matter, is it?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\nThe thing that alarmed Ellen was the feverish, uncanny expression in\r\nher eyes; the look of a young animal that has been mortally wounded.\r\nShe remembered a kitten with a broken back that looked at her like that\r\nonce in her childhood. She could see now the wide-set glittering eyes\r\nwith their expression of dumb wonder before it died.\r\n\r\nAt least she thanked God that he had the decency to respect her own\r\nfeelings by silence in this the bitterest and loneliest hour her\r\nown soul had ever known. His high sense of honor and of decency\r\nmight prevent his ever declaring his love to Rose even if the girl’s\r\nintuitions were correct.\r\n\r\nWhy add another tragedy to her own? She had sought self-development and\r\nlost the way of life in selfishness. Her anger against the man who had\r\ndeserted her should not be allowed to wreck the happiness of the little\r\ngirl who trusted her utterly.\r\n\r\nBesides, she had given this man the right to go when he saw fit.\r\nAgainst his protest she had forced this freedom upon him. If he had\r\nfallen in love with her niece, how could she reproach him? Her anger\r\nand misery were illogical. She had made her life what it was by an act\r\nof will.\r\n\r\nShe saw her way clearly in a sudden flash of unselfish love.\r\n\r\n“Would you like me to find out why he left you so abruptly, dear?”\r\nEllen whispered.\r\n\r\nHer lips moved, but could say nothing.\r\n\r\nThe dumb anguish and the unspoken appeal found Ellen’s heart.\r\n\r\n“I’ll see,” she said cheerfully. “Be still and leave it all to me now,\r\nwill you?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve nobody in the world to leave it to, honey, but you and God.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll be back in a minute, dear,” Ellen called from the door.\r\n\r\nShe quickly descended the stairs and rang the telephone of Manning’s\r\napartment on Thirty-first Street. If he were leaving for a long stay\r\nthe chances were ten to one that he would take four or five hours\r\nto get his papers and personal effects together before returning to\r\nLakewood.\r\n\r\nA new voice answered the telephone.\r\n\r\n“Yes, this is Mr. Manning’s apartment. I am Mr. Manning’s valet. What\r\nis it?”\r\n\r\nShe smiled at the thought of his rise in the world since the day they\r\nmet four years ago! From a tiny room on Washington Square to national\r\nfame, a fortune, and a valet to attend his personal needs! She threw\r\nthe thought of petty jealousy from her. He was ill. She was glad he\r\ncould afford a man.\r\n\r\n“May I speak to Mr. Manning, please?” she answered slowly.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Manning is lying down. He is quite ill, you know. I have orders\r\nnot to disturb him. I can’t unless it’s a matter of great importance.”\r\n\r\n“It’s the gravest importance--it may be a matter of life and death!\r\nPlease tell him this.”\r\n\r\n“Your name, madam?”\r\n\r\nShe hesitated an instant.\r\n\r\n“Tell him I am speaking for Miss Rose O’Neil.”\r\n\r\nShe wondered if he would refuse to answer. A refusal would be proof\r\nthat he didn’t care. Or would it be just the opposite? Was his old\r\nsense of loyalty still so strong that he would refuse to humiliate the\r\nwoman he once loved by the acknowledgment before her that he loved\r\nanother?\r\n\r\nShe was not long left in doubt. She heard his quick nervous grip on the\r\ntelephone receiver.\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“This is Ellen.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!”\r\n\r\n“You must come at once to my apartment.”\r\n\r\n“Please--I’m not equal to it.”\r\n\r\n“You must come at once!”\r\n\r\n“I was sorry afterwards,” he went on, “that I was so brutal and abrupt,\r\nbut it’s best after all. I couldn’t endure another such scene to-day.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t understand. I am speaking for my niece.”\r\n\r\n“But you’re not really--you don’t mean that?”\r\n\r\nShe caught the tremor in his voice that was unmistakable.\r\n\r\n“I do. Surely you know me well enough to realize that I have too much\r\npride to stoop to a lie to get you to the telephone.”\r\n\r\n“Forgive me,” he broke in. “She asked you to call me?”\r\n\r\n“No. She is very ill.”\r\n\r\n“Ill!”\r\n\r\n“When I told her that you had called and left without a word she\r\ncollapsed. You must not go without seeing her.”\r\n\r\n“Of course--I’ll--come--at--once.”\r\n\r\nHis voice was husky with excitement. She could feel in the electric\r\ncurrent his nervous tension.\r\n\r\nIn ten minutes he was mounting her stairs with firmer step than when he\r\ncalled on hour ago.\r\n\r\nShe could see at a glance that he had recovered himself. He walked with\r\nmore vigor. His step was quick and nervous as if he were drawing on his\r\nlast reserve forces, but his voice was under perfect control.\r\n\r\n“I hope she’s not in a serious condition,” he said.\r\n\r\nEllen seated herself and looked at him keenly.\r\n\r\n“That depends, I think, on you.”\r\n\r\nHe fumbled his chin nervously and twisted the muscles of his strong\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n“On--me--why? What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Come, now, face it squarely. Be honest with yourself and tell me the\r\ntruth. I’ve made up my mind since I closed that door on you an hour ago\r\nthat the first phase of my life is finished forever!”\r\n\r\nShe paused and struggled with her emotion.\r\n\r\n“I’ve some hard battles ahead of me,” she went on, “but I’ll win them.\r\nYou know this.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know,” he said tensely. “You’re a marvellous woman.”\r\n\r\n“You’re not to think of me any more. I’ll work out my salvation in\r\nmy own way. You must have your way in life. It’s the old way of the\r\ntrustful, worshipful, helpful little wife with home and babies----”\r\n\r\nHer voice broke in spite of her effort at control. He breathed deeply\r\nand looked through the windows on the clearing skies, but made no\r\nresponse.\r\n\r\n“I have no reproaches. I had my way. You told me it would be a failure.\r\nHow tragic it has really been I don’t think you will ever know----”\r\n\r\nHe raised his hand in protest.\r\n\r\n“On the other hand, the certainty that you would suffer is the one\r\nthing that hurts me most.”\r\n\r\nShe looked at him gravely.\r\n\r\n“It’s sweet to hear you say it, though I know that only God can\r\nunderstand all this day has meant to me! But I have fought the last\r\nbattle with self and I have won.”\r\n\r\nShe rose, slowly crossed the space that separated them and stood over\r\nhim. She was smiling in the friendliest way.\r\n\r\n“Come, now, be fair to yourself! You owe it to me, for I’m going to be\r\nyour best friend always if I can’t be your wife. You’re in love with my\r\nlittle Rose--is it not so?”\r\n\r\nHe set his square jaws firmly.\r\n\r\n“Why do you torture me like this?” he asked at last.\r\n\r\n“I don’t mean it, dear boy! I’m thinking of her too.”\r\n\r\nHe threw a quick, searching look.\r\n\r\n“Does--does--she love me?”\r\n\r\n“With a love that might kill her kind unless you are good to her.”\r\n\r\nTears blinded him and he turned away.\r\n\r\n“You know that I love her!”\r\n\r\n“I’ve feared it.”\r\n\r\n“But I couldn’t hurt you by such a declaration.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!” she protested cheerily. “At least you’ve paid me the high\r\ncompliment of falling in love with my miniature. And I’ll be frank\r\nenough to acknowledge that she’s prettier than I am. You’ve won the\r\nheart of the dearest and most unselfish little girl in the world. She\r\nwill make you very happy. I congratulate you!”\r\n\r\nShe took his hand in a way so friendly and reassuring he could not\r\nresist.\r\n\r\n“We must not allow our mistakes to spoil three lives,” she went on\r\nrapidly. “Come--tell my girl that you love her and she’ll be laughing\r\nall over the place in five minutes.”\r\n\r\nHe held back stubbornly. She drew him out of the chair toward the\r\nbalcony stairs.\r\n\r\nHe stopped and blushed.\r\n\r\n“I--can--go--to her room?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly. I’ll chaperone you. She’s just lying there on the bed,\r\nwhere I put her after she had fainted.”\r\n\r\nShe led him gently up the stairs, pushed him into the room and turned\r\naway.\r\n\r\nRose lifted herself on her elbow and stared in rapture.\r\n\r\n“Oh--you--have--come--back--to--see--me!” she breathed.\r\n\r\nHe took her in his arms.\r\n\r\n“My Rose!” he whispered as his hand gently touched her hair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n                             THE COLLAPSE\r\n\r\n\r\nELLEN hurried downstairs. She was mistress of her emotions, but she\r\nshrank from the sight of their love-meeting. She sat down quietly\r\nbeside her window in the bright sunlight. The last cloud had cleared\r\nfrom the skies and the snow mantle flashed in unearthly brilliance.\r\n\r\nHer quick mind had determined the action of the drama to its final\r\ndetail. She would give them half an hour alone, call a clergyman, pack\r\nRose’s trunk, marry them on the spot, and send them off together for\r\nthe South. They probably would not leave Lakewood. He would be well and\r\nhappy in two weeks.\r\n\r\nShe called a clergyman on the telephone.\r\n\r\n“You can perform a marriage ceremony at three o’clock, Dr. Davis?” she\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” was the quick response; “that’s one of the joys of my busy\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\n“You make out the records yourself, I believe?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; in New York a clergyman is the officer of the law charged with\r\nfull authority and he makes out all the papers. I’ll bring them.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you. Promptly at three, Doctor.”\r\n\r\n“Promptly at three!”\r\n\r\nShe hung up the telephone receiver as Manning and Rose entered the\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\nShe heard the swish of a skirt and the girl leaped into her arms.\r\n\r\n“Auntie, darling, you’re my honey, fairy-Godmother!”\r\n\r\n“My girlie,” she murmured.\r\n\r\n“He loves me, honey! He loves me--he loves me. I’m the happiest,\r\ncraziest little fool on earth, and I owe it all to you! You gave\r\nme my home--you introduced him to me--you gave me the chance to\r\nknow and love him--you brought him back to me when he was sick and\r\ndiscouraged--you’re an angel!”\r\n\r\nEllen’s lips moved without words--only the half articulate crooning of\r\na mother over a babe was heard.\r\n\r\nManning stood at the window watching the street cleaners shoveling the\r\nsnow. Ellen led Rose to his side and placed her hand in his.\r\n\r\n“Well, Mr. Man, I’m going to see that you have it all your own way\r\nto-day! I’ve sent for a clergyman. You are to be married here at three\r\no’clock!”\r\n\r\n“What!” he gasped.\r\n\r\nRose gave a cry of wonder and joy.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it’s all arranged. Rose can pack in an hour. There’s no need for\r\na fuss. It will be the best medicine you can take, my boy. There’s no\r\nuse to argue. I’ve the habit of having my way, you know. It happens\r\nthat my way is yours, this time!”\r\n\r\nRose’s hand was gripping Manning’s with joyous excitement.\r\n\r\n“It’s all right; I can be ready in a minute!”\r\n\r\n“Of course, if she says so; we’ll have to do as she says,” Manning\r\nagreed.\r\n\r\nHe smiled at Ellen.\r\n\r\nShe turned to him in a quick, business-like way.\r\n\r\n“Run along now, Mr. Man, to your apartment; have your valet get\r\neverything ready and be back here with him for a witness with Dora at\r\nexactly ten minutes to three.”\r\n\r\nShe hustled him off and helped Rose pack as best she could between the\r\nparoxysm of kisses and bear hugs.\r\n\r\nIt was not until she said good-bye to the bride and groom at the\r\nPennsylvania station that her nerves began to snap.\r\n\r\nShe felt a sudden nausea and turned to her maid.\r\n\r\n“Give me your hand, Dora; I’ve--been--in--such a rush I feel dizzy.”\r\n\r\nDora threw her a look of anxiety.\r\n\r\n“Yes’m; we git a cab.”\r\n\r\n“Just a minute--I must send a telegram.” She got to the telegraph\r\nbooth, seized a blank and sent a message to her father.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN BURKE WEST,\r\n     Annapolis, Maryland.\r\n\r\n Come to New York immediately.\r\n\r\n                                                                 ELLEN.\r\n\r\nBy a desperate effort she kept on her feet until she reached her\r\napartment.\r\n\r\nWhen the old Captain hurried into her room next morning her fever was a\r\nhundred and four and she was delirious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n                            THE OLD SOLDIER\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN West took charge of the apartment and called another doctor.\r\nEllen’s physician mildly protested against the necessity of such action\r\non the second day of her attack.\r\n\r\nThe fiery-tempered old man would brook no argument.\r\n\r\n“I want a consultation, sir, immediately!” he snapped. “My daughter\r\nis dangerously ill. She’s the one human being I have always loved--my\r\nother daughter never understood me. I’ll take no chances. Will you call\r\nthe best doctor in New York to consult with you, sir, or shall I do it\r\nmyself?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, Captain, at once.”\r\n\r\nThe consulting physician confirmed the first diagnosis. The evidences\r\nof brain fever were unmistakeable.\r\n\r\n“Call two trained nurses,” the Captain ordered.\r\n\r\nFor a week the old man never left her bedside during the day except to\r\ntake his meals. The first hour of his watch he had caught a sentence\r\nfrom her fevered lips that set his brain on fire. He insisted on every\r\nmoment by her that his strength would permit. The night nurse usually\r\nhad to drag him to his room. And he would often suddenly reappear at\r\nthe door staring at the prostrate figure, a strange glitter in the\r\ndepths of his eyes. The nurse was alarmed for his reason and insisted\r\non the doctor prescribing for his insomnia.\r\n\r\nHe threw the medicine out of the window.\r\n\r\n“Don’t bring any more of that stuff to me!” he growled. “I’ll let you\r\nknow if I need it.”\r\n\r\nBy the end of the third day the fever suddenly began to subside and her\r\nbrain to clear. The old man watched her with his keen eyes trying to\r\npierce the depths of her soul.\r\n\r\nThe hard light in them softened as he saw her smile for the first time.\r\n\r\n“So you’ve come, dad!” she murmured.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my baby,” he answered cheerfully; “but you must not talk. The\r\ndoctor says you’ll get well. That’s all I ask of the darn fools.\r\nThey’ve got no sense anyhow.”\r\n\r\n“Then--why--send--for--them?”\r\n\r\nThe Captain lifted his hand in stern command.\r\n\r\n“Don’t talk!”\r\n\r\nEllen smiled, extended her hand and pressed his. He bowed his gray head\r\nand kissed it tenderly.\r\n\r\nAt the end of two more weeks the nurses were dismissed. She had\r\nrecovered with remarkable speed. The doctor was surprised. A hidden\r\nreserve power within had set at naught all predictions of a protracted\r\nillness.\r\n\r\n“I’m not surprised,” the old man snapped; “my daughter’s the most\r\nremarkable woman I ever knew. No two human beings, sir, are alike.”\r\n\r\nHe would have given the doctor a lecture on physiology had he been\r\nwilling to listen.\r\n\r\nHe excused himself with a smile.\r\n\r\n“Call me, Captain, if she needs me,” he said at the door.\r\n\r\nThe old soldier waved him off impatiently.\r\n\r\n“She’s all right, sir!”\r\n\r\nThree days later he dismissed the nurses. Dora could now attend her\r\nsimple needs.\r\n\r\nHe suddenly appeared in her room dressed with unusual care. He spoke\r\nwith an obvious effort to appear at ease.\r\n\r\n“I’m worn out with the loss of sleep, baby,” he announced. “I’ve\r\ndecided to run down to Lakewood for a few days.”\r\n\r\n“To Lakewood!”\r\n\r\n“Yes. You’re all right now. I’ll be back at the end of the week. I’ve\r\nan old war comrade down there. I’ll make him a little visit.”\r\n\r\nEllen watched furtively.\r\n\r\nThe truth suddenly flashed on her. She had talked in her delirium.\r\nHe had heard and pieced together the facts of her love for Manning,\r\nhis betrayal and desertion. Merciful God! what had she said? Possibly\r\neverything. And what she had not said he had probably learned from\r\nRose’s letters. Once his suspicions aroused she knew him too well to\r\ndoubt that he would hesitate at nothing. They had allowed her to read\r\nno mail.\r\n\r\nA terrible fear chilled her.\r\n\r\n“You mustn’t leave me now, dad,” she faltered.\r\n\r\n“Why, you’re all right. Dora’s a good girl. She’ll look after you and\r\nthe doctor’s just around the corner.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t feel well this morning,” she insisted.\r\n\r\n“Pooh! pooh!” he growled. “You just want to boss your daddy as you\r\nalways did. Go to sleep; I’ve got to catch a train.”\r\n\r\nHe bent and kissed her good-by and turned quickly to go. Her keen eye\r\nin the turn caught the tragic purpose in the grim set face.\r\n\r\nShe leaped to her feet with a cry, sprang on him at the door and before\r\nhe could recover from his surprise drew the revolver from his pocket.\r\n\r\nShe pushed him into a chair and slammed the door.\r\n\r\n“What does this mean?” she sternly demanded.\r\n\r\nThe old man’s breast heaved with emotion.\r\n\r\n“It--means--that I am going to blow the brains out of the cur who has\r\nruined my daughter!”\r\n\r\n“Oh--no--you’re not,” was the cool reply.\r\n\r\n“You can’t stop me!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I can!”\r\n\r\nShe was deliberately removing the cartridges from the revolver. She\r\nplaced it under her pillow and sat down on the edge of the bed.\r\n\r\n“There are plenty of guns and I know how to use them, thank God,” he\r\nmuttered.\r\n\r\n“But you won’t use them, dad.”\r\n\r\nThe old man sprang to his feet and turned toward the door.\r\n\r\n“By God, I’ll show you!”\r\n\r\nShe seized his arm and led him to the bedside.\r\n\r\n“Sit down now and I’ll tell you the whole story.”\r\n\r\n“The whole truth and nothing but the truth?” he demanded.\r\n\r\n“The whole, bitter truth,” she repeated sadly.\r\n\r\nWithout reservation, without excuse or palliation she told him the\r\nstory of her life in New York, of her meeting with Manning, of their\r\nlove-affair, of her forcing him into the free alliance of her new\r\ncreed, of their bickering and quarrelling, jealousy and unhappiness.\r\nWith simple honesty she told of the coming of Rose, of their\r\nresistless love, of the fight he had made, of the girl’s innocence of\r\ntheir former relations, of her sacrifice of herself and their marriage.\r\n\r\nThe old soldier had sunk lower and lower with each turn of the story.\r\nHe asked no questions. He knew that she was telling the brutal truth\r\nwithout mercy to herself.\r\n\r\nAt the end she drew the revolver out and handed it to him.\r\n\r\n“Now, I’ll give you back your revolver. Do you wish to go to Lakewood?”\r\n\r\n“No, my baby,” he answered dully; “I just wish to die--now--that’s all!”\r\n\r\n“Why, why, my poor dad,” she asked pathetically, “do you still believe\r\nin the magic of a marriage ceremony when yours trapped you in a prison\r\nwhich only the death of my mother opened at last?”\r\n\r\nThe gray figure stiffened.\r\n\r\n“Marriage, my child, is a divine sacrament--the great social ordinance\r\non which human civilization rests. The fact that your mother and I made\r\na mistake does not change this. I have nothing to live for now. You\r\nwere the apple of my eye--I’m done!”\r\n\r\nShe slipped her arms about his neck, her head against his breast, and\r\nlet the tears flow unheeded for a moment.\r\n\r\n“You mustn’t feel that way, dad,” she murmured. “We have each other;\r\nand for me it’s still the morning of life.”\r\n\r\nThere was a dead look in his eyes as he slowly shook his head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n                              COMPROMISE\r\n\r\n\r\nELLEN watched her father putter about the room in a hopeless sort of\r\nway without knowing exactly what he was trying to do. It cut her to\r\nthe heart to see his abject surrender. There was something about his\r\nmanner that told he would not rally. She thought with a shudder of the\r\npossibility of his death from the blow which she had given him. She\r\nmust get him out of this dangerous mood. The afternoon April sun was\r\nshining in her windows with unusual warmth. She decided to throw on a\r\nnegligee, go down to the library and cheer him up.\r\n\r\nHe protested feebly at first, but yielded to her firm decision.\r\n\r\n“Run along, daddy dear, and I’ll be down in a minute.”\r\n\r\nShe kissed him at the door.\r\n\r\n“Be a good boy, now, and I’ll cheer you up.”\r\n\r\nHe made no response and she found him ten minutes later seated in an\r\narmchair staring into space.\r\n\r\nShe took her seat at the piano and played for him for half an hour.\r\nHe was fond of music and had always been proud of her skill as a\r\nmusician. When she rose from the piano he was still staring blankly\r\ninto space. He had scarcely moved a muscle.\r\n\r\n“Did I play as well as I used to, dad?” she asked.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her with a start.\r\n\r\n“What--did--you--say?”\r\n\r\n“Did you like the music?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, child; you always play divinely,” he replied without interest.\r\n\r\nHe pressed his hand to his forehead.\r\n\r\n“I--have--forgotten something I meant to tell you--oh--yes--the mail.\r\nYou have a lot of mail.”\r\n\r\nHe rose, went to her desk and drew out a pile of letters.\r\n\r\nShe glanced through them quickly and her eye rested on one with a Long\r\nIsland post-mark dated the day following her collapse. In the upper\r\nleft hand corner was the crest of Edwin Brown.\r\n\r\nShe opened and read it with a flutter of excitement,\r\n\r\nDEAR MISS WEST:\r\n\r\n A bolt of lightning suddenly struck me this morning when I read the\r\n announcement of the marriage of Mr. Manning and your niece. It was\r\n incredible, but it brought me the first hour of real happiness I have\r\n known in a long time. You have tried the high ideal of your creed and\r\n met with tragedy.\r\n\r\n The biggest thing that ever came into my life is my love for you. With\r\n you by my side I can do something worth while in the world. Can’t we\r\n compromise? I’ll give up the flesh if you will give up the spirit.\r\n Will you marry me immediately?\r\n\r\n                                                           EDWIN BROWN.\r\n\r\nEllen rose and walked to the window, her brain in a tumult. Life is\r\nmade up of compromises after all. Why not? It would make her old father\r\nfoolishly happy. To his mind Brown was one of the greatest figures of\r\nthe city. He would strut over those beautiful grounds on Long Island\r\nthe balance of his life with the vanity of a peacock.\r\n\r\nShe looked at his forlorn figure slouched low in dumb misery.\r\n\r\nShe returned to her desk and glanced through the mail again.\r\n\r\nAnother letter from Brown lay at the bottom of the pile. It was\r\npost-marked a week later. It was just a line to express his anxiety at\r\nher illness. He would await her reply with patience.\r\n\r\nShe called his telephone on Long Island. The butler answered and\r\ninstantly connected her with Brown’s room. He evidently had orders to\r\nawait this call.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, Miss West!” was the eager answer.\r\n\r\n“Could you call at my apartment and meet my father, Captain Burke West?”\r\n\r\n“At once. I’ll be there within an hour; you--you--got my letters?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Within an hour--I’ll be there!”\r\n\r\nThe boyish ring to his voice was pleasant to hear after the knocks her\r\npride had received of late.\r\n\r\nShe laid her hand on her father’s shoulder and roused him from his\r\nstupor.\r\n\r\n“Wouldn’t you like to meet Mr. Edwin Brown, dad?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Who?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Edwin Brown.”\r\n\r\n“The millionaire sportsman and newspaper man?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Why--I should consider it a very great pleasure to meet such a man. I\r\nhave heard so much about him--why, of course, yes----”\r\n\r\nHe paused and frowned.\r\n\r\n“No--no--I wasn’t thinking of what I was saying. I don’t want to meet\r\nhim--no!”\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid you’ll have to--he’s on his way here now.”\r\n\r\nHe shot a look of ugly suspicion that cut her to the quick.\r\n\r\n“I won’t see him,” he snapped.\r\n\r\n“Don’t be silly, dad.”\r\n\r\n“To hell with him, I tell you; I won’t see him!”\r\n\r\nShe made no further protest, but read her mail until Brown came.\r\n\r\nShe took his hand with a quiet smile and led him into the room. The old\r\nman rose awkwardly and tried to pass them on his way to the balcony\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\nEllen caught his arm and led him back.\r\n\r\n“This, father, is my fiancé, Mr. Edwin Brown. We are to be married in\r\nJune.”\r\n\r\nThe wrinkled face flushed with surprise.\r\n\r\n“What?” he gasped.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it’s time you made his acquaintance.”\r\n\r\nThe old man extended his hand and Brown grasped it, laughing.\r\n\r\n“You have brought me luck, Captain West!” he cried heartily.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been your daughter’s humble suitor for more than four years. She\r\nhas just accepted me. May I have your congratulations?”\r\n\r\n“With all my heart, sir!” he said, choking back the tears.\r\n\r\n“This makes me very--very--happy, I assure you!”\r\n\r\nHe took Ellen in his arms and held her a long time in silence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n                               EPILOGUE\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE tall figure of Edwin Brown no longer haunts the cafés of Broadway\r\nand Fifth Avenue. Long Island has gained in him an enthusiastic farmer,\r\nwho gives much time to the breeding of fine horses and cattle.\r\n\r\nOn the day of his marriage he bought _The New Era Magazine_ and\r\ngave it to his wife. It is no longer the organ of radical feminism,\r\nbut has become very popular and turned out to be a sound business\r\ninvestment.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Brown has proven himself in many ways an exceptional husband.\r\nThe old Captain, who is his valuable assistant on the farm, whispers\r\nnow and then into Ellen’s ear that his like has never been seen. His\r\nstately daughter smiles a quiet answer that suggests an agreement with\r\nthis opinion, although she has never ventured to say as much in the\r\npresence of mere man.\r\n\r\nShe writes her editorials now at a desk beside the south window of the\r\nnursery in their spacious Long Island home. A little cherub boy is\r\nforever pulling at her skirts, but she doesn’t seem to mind--not even\r\nwhen he gets hold of one of her manuscripts and chews a page out of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         =TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES=\r\n\r\nSimple typographical errors have been silently corrected; unbalanced\r\nquotation marks were remedied when the change was obvious, and\r\notherwise left unbalanced.\r\n\r\nPunctuation and spelling were made consistent when a predominant\r\npreference was found in the original book; otherwise they were not\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\nInconsistent hyphens left as printed.",

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks."
