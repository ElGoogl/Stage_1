There they\r\nfind all they need--the hedges are usually bright with hips, and with\r\nthe darker crimson berries of the hawthorn; the fields are all\r\npasture-meadows, and the grass is tufty and full of insects; a little\r\nstream winds snake-like through the fields, hidden by an overarching\r\ngrowth of briar and bramble. No well-worn path crosses these meadows,\r\nand you may count on being undisturbed if you sit for a few minutes, to\r\nenjoy the winter sunshine and watch the shy birds, on the bole of one of\r\nthe scattered elms that shelter the cows in summer. The fieldfares are\r\nin clover here: they get food, drink, sunshine when there is any, and\r\nabove all the solitude they so deeply love. In other parts of the\r\ndistrict you may see them, or you may not, for they move about and show\r\ntheir handsome forms and slaty backs, now here, now there; but in this\r\nfavoured haunt some are always to be seen, and set up their loud\r\ncall-note from elm or hedgetop as soon as your intruding form is seen\r\nmoving in their direction.\r\n\r\nOne autumn there had been but a poor crop of berries; and by the time\r\nthe fieldfares arrived in middle England the blackbirds and\r\nmissel-thrushes had already rifled the hedges of much of their fruit.\r\nBut up to the middle of January enough remained to feed the usual number\r\nof visitors, and when once January is past, they may hope for open\r\nweather and a plentiful supply of grubs and worms to help them out.\r\nDuring the third week in that wintry month, the sun shone bright and\r\nwarm, though the fields were covered with hoar frost at night; no\r\nthought of trouble entered the hearts of the birds; in the middle of the\r\nday you might even have heard them uttering a faint kind of song from\r\nthe hedge-top over the brook, as the genial sun warmed them and bade\r\nthem think of the spring that was surely coming.\r\n\r\nBut the frost went on, day by day; and now the blue sky was covered with\r\ndull cloud, driven before a bitter north-east wind, so that the sun\r\ncould no longer melt the hard-bound meadows with his midday glow. The\r\nfieldfares found themselves quite alone. The redwings had gone to the\r\nneighbourhood of the towns and villages, and so too had the robins and\r\nwrens, who had lived in the hedges all the winter through till now. The\r\nrooks and starlings were in the ploughed fields, and searching even\r\nthere almost in vain for food. A chance crow or magpie was all the\r\ncompany they had for several days together; and crows and magpies are\r\nnot always agreeable neighbours.\r\n\r\nAt last the berries were all gone, and the ground so hard-frozen that no\r\nbill could break it and no bird hope to find grub or worm there. Some of\r\nthe elder birds went a long distance one day to forage; they returned\r\nvery tired with news of a single hedge on which there was still some\r\nstore of berries, but they had left one of their number behind them.\r\nThe old birds looked very grave; they called a meeting, and then the\r\neldest, with drooping tail and lack-lustre eye, told them that they must\r\nstay no longer where they were, and no longer keep all together. They\r\nmust break up into small parties and find their food as best they could\r\nfor themselves; if they did not go far, and the frost broke up, they\r\nmight all find their way back again in a few days; all might yet be\r\nwell. “But I must tell you,” said he, turning to the younger birds,\r\n“that if the frost goes on, or if snow falls, we shall all be in peril\r\nof our lives. And see, a light, dry snow is falling already! You that\r\nare young and strong must leave us at once and go southward. Do not\r\ndelay a moment; fly while you can. We, who are already tired out, will\r\nseek the berry hedge we found, and try and recruit ourselves before we\r\nmove further. We left our poor old friend under that hedge this morning,\r\nwith his head under his wing, and we do not know whether we shall find\r\nhim again alive. But we will all hope for the best, and try to struggle\r\nthrough a bad time. Good-bye, young ones, good-bye! Be sure you break up\r\ninto companies of three or four, or you will never find enough to keep\r\nyou from starving. Keep a good heart, and go straight southwards towards\r\nthe mid-day sun, and when the frost goes, come again northwards, and\r\nhope to find us here.” Then he flew away, slowly and feebly, and most of\r\nthe other old birds followed him.\r\n\r\nThe young ones, who still had plenty of life and hope in them, and\r\nhardly knew what it was to be in peril of their lives, soon broke up\r\ninto different divisions, and started different ways, but all in a\r\nsouthward direction. Each company had its leader, and there was much\r\nrivalry as to which should belong to the company which was led by a\r\nhandsome and lively bird named Cocktail, to whom they all looked up. But\r\nCocktail would not have more than three with him; and Cocktail was wont\r\nto have his own way. He chose his great friend Feltie[1] and two others,\r\nJack and Jill; and off they went with a loud and hearty good-bye; the\r\nother three quite confident in Cocktail’s prudence, skill, and courage.\r\nHe was nearly two years old; he had had a nest and family last summer\r\nin a Norwegian pine-forest; he had attacked a magpie that was\r\nthreatening his young, and beaten it away in disgrace; he had led a\r\nlarge party across the Northern Sea last autumn to England, and had\r\nfound them all a breakfast within an hour of landing. Whatever he did\r\nwas sure to be right, and wherever he went there was sure to be food. He\r\nwas well aware of all his virtues, and liked, in a cheerful and pleasant\r\nway, to be made much of; and he had taken young Feltie under his\r\nprotection from their first acquaintance, because Feltie had very soon\r\nmade it plain that in his honest eyes there was no such bird as Cocktail\r\nto be found in the whole world. Jill was chosen because she was a young\r\nhen-bird of a mild and yielding disposition, yet of pleasant manners and\r\nladylike ways; and to say the truth, during these sunny days of late,\r\nCocktail had cast an approving eye upon her, and had half made up his\r\nmind to select her as his partner for the coming spring and\r\nsummer--provided of course that no one with superior charms should meet\r\nhis eye in the meantime. As for her own choice in the matter, that never\r\nentered into his calculations. Lastly, Jack was the brother of Jill,\r\nand very fond of her--which is not usually the case with brothers and\r\nsisters among the fieldfares; and on this account he was allowed to join\r\nthe party. “We must have one more,” Cocktail had said before they\r\nstarted, “and it really doesn’t much matter who it is provided he will\r\nfollow me and do what I tell him. No swaggerers here, please; I want\r\nsome one who’s nobody in particular!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, if you wouldn’t mind, Cocktail,” said Jill humbly, “I don’t think\r\nJack is any one in particular, mayn’t he come?”\r\n\r\n“Let him come forward,” said Cocktail magnificently; “let me see him.\r\nHere, you Jack, are you any one in particular?” Jack declared that he\r\nwas no one but himself, and therefore could not be any one _in\r\nparticular_, like Cocktail; and on the strength of this he was admitted\r\nto the little company.\r\n\r\nCocktail now found the fondest desire of his heart realized; so far his\r\ngenius had always been hampered by older birds, who in spite of their\r\ninferior talents would always contrive to direct the movements of a\r\ntroop by combining together: but now he was in sole and happy command\r\nof three admiring subjects, who would not worry him with advice, and\r\nwould obey his orders implicitly. He took them first to the top of a\r\ntall elm, whence they could see over the fast whitening fields to a\r\nrange of hills not far away to the southward; he told them that he\r\nshould cross those hills and rest for the night on the other side in\r\nshelter which he would find for them. Meanwhile they were to fly at a\r\nlittle distance apart, in order to keep a good look-out for berries; but\r\nthey must always keep their eyes on him, and when they heard his signal\r\n“Chak-chak,” they were to join him again at once.\r\n\r\n“The first who fails to come at that signal,” said Cocktail, “or who is\r\nguilty of any negligence or disobedience, WILL BE AT ONCE LEFT BEHIND!”\r\n\r\nWith these words he started off, and the others followed him as they had\r\nbeen told, at a little distance to right and left. Very little in the\r\nway of food was found that day, and Jack and Jill were getting tired and\r\nhungry, when after rising to the hills, and passing for some miles over\r\nhigh, desolate country, where there was hardly a hedge to be seen, and\r\nthe white carpet was only broken by low gray stone walls which could not\r\nhelp a hungry fieldfare, they descended towards evening into the shelter\r\nof a little well-wooded valley,[2] where were the pleasant grounds of a\r\ngentleman’s house. Cocktail made straight for this house, but stopped\r\nshort on a tall tree outside the garden, and began to look round him.\r\n\r\nIt was about four o’clock, and fast getting dark. He could see the lamp\r\nlighted in a room in the house, and a bright fire burning; a lady sat by\r\nthe fire at work; then a maid came in with tea, and the blinds were\r\ndrawn down, the shutters closed, and all was gray and cold again. But\r\nCocktail’s keen eye had seen something by the bright firelight which\r\nmade him jerk his tail and sit more upright on his bough--berries,\r\nscarlet berries, arranged all about an old oak chimney-piece!\r\n\r\n“Shame!” said he indignantly; “but there must be more of them in the\r\ngarden.” And bidding the others follow, he flew down into the\r\nwell-planted grounds. They here found themselves nearer to human\r\nhabitations than they had ever been in their lives before; but hunger\r\nmade them bold. “To right and left,” said Cocktail, “and look for\r\nholly-bushes.” His own search was a failure; he found several bushes,\r\nbut not a berry was left. He felt very angry when he thought of the rich\r\nstore of berries inside that cosy room, where no starving birds could\r\nget at them. There was the well-fed lady enjoying her tea by the fire,\r\nand looking with admiration at the berries (_looking_ indeed, thought\r\nCocktail, and not eating them!), and here were four poor birds starving\r\noutside in the cold for want of them.\r\n\r\nBut now a “chak” was heard from another part of the garden. Making his\r\nway there, he found that Jack was the lucky discoverer of a bush that\r\nstill boasted a fair store of berries; up came the others too, and now\r\nthey had a good feast on the berries as long as the light lasted: then,\r\nat Cocktail’s order, they dropped down to roost in a thick shrubbery\r\nsome distance from the house, where the evergreens had as yet kept the\r\nsnow from lying very deep upon the ground. In a few minutes their four\r\nheads were under their tired wings, and they were fast asleep.\r\n\r\nNext day they were awake early, but their breakfast on the remaining\r\nberries was rudely interrupted by the gardener, who came to sweep the\r\nsnow from the walks; and after lingering in a tree for a few minutes,\r\nCocktail gave an angry “chak,” and led the way again southwards. To have\r\nhis breakfast broken into in this way was more than he was used to, and\r\nfor several days he had had no morning bath. And more than that, he was\r\ntired and stiff with the night’s hard frost; so his temper was not so\r\ngood as usual, and he flew high and quick, hardly looking at the hedges\r\nas he passed over them. Many a time the others would fain have stopped\r\nto pick a stray berry, or try for grains on a stubble-field where they\r\ncould see partridges cowering below them; but on went Cocktail without\r\nheeding, and on they had to go too.\r\n\r\nAbout midday they came to the foot of another long range of hills, which\r\nthey had seen in the distance for some time. The north-east wind was\r\nblowing hard, and had driven them some way to the westwards; and they\r\nhad turned still farther west to avoid a large town,[3] where engines\r\nwere puffing, and trains rushing continually in and out. Under these\r\nhills they found a large park, with thorn-bushes planted here and there,\r\non which a few berries were still showing red through the white rime\r\nthat clung to them; and here Cocktail at last halted, and allowed his\r\nfamished followers a little rest. But he was more severe and imperious\r\nthan on the day before, and strictly forbade them to go out of his\r\nsight.\r\n\r\n“We shall go on again before long,” he said; “we must get further south\r\nyet, so be ready to start at any moment.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you think,” said Jack, “that we might stay here a day or two at\r\nleast? The park is large, and there are a few berries on a good many of\r\nthe trees.”\r\n\r\n“Did I ask your advice?” said Cocktail angrily.\r\n\r\n“No, you didn’t, but--”\r\n\r\n“Then hold your tongue, Mr. Nobody-in-particular. I did not bring you\r\nhere to tell me what I ought to do. Leave this bush directly. Do as I\r\ntell you at once--it’s all you’re fit for.” So Jack retired in disgrace,\r\nand in great wrath, and Jill went with him. Poor little Jill! She was\r\ngetting very faint, and had hardly had strength left to get as far as\r\nshe had come; but being a brave little soul she kept it to herself and\r\nstruggled on. But when she was alone with Jack she told him how bad she\r\nfelt.\r\n\r\n“Jack,” she said, “I can fly no further to-day. Why does he want to go\r\non?”\r\n\r\n“Because he knows more about it than we do, I suppose,” said Jack. “And\r\nwe have promised to follow, you know. You must have a good dinner and\r\ncome on somehow.”\r\n\r\n“But I can’t eat,” said Jill: “I’m so tired, I can hardly move, and the\r\nberries are so hard and dry, I can’t get them down my throat.”\r\n\r\n“That’s serious,” returned Jack; “you must certainly have rest. I’ll go\r\nand tell Cocktail, and he’ll be sure to stay a day or two.”\r\n\r\nSo Jack flew back to Cocktail’s bush, but was instantly ordered off\r\nagain. Feltie however flew after him to ask what he wanted, and on\r\nhearing the state of things, undertook to be his ambassador to\r\nCocktail. But that imperious captain would not listen.\r\n\r\n“Rubbish,” he said. “Do you suppose I didn’t know that we should have\r\nthis kind of thing going on? What’s the good of a leader if he is not to\r\nwhip up lazy birds?” And he instantly gave the signal for starting, and\r\nflew off towards the hills. Feltie followed him by instinct, and turning\r\nto look back, saw Jack and Jill starting too, the latter flying slowly\r\nand feebly. Feltie’s heart sank within him; he couldn’t help thinking\r\nthat it was cruel of Cocktail, and that there was no real reason why\r\nthey should not stay. He looked at the line of hills; they were one long\r\nrange of pure white, not even broken by the dark line of a wall or a\r\nhedge. As the ground rose below them the cold wind blew still colder.\r\nHow much more comfortable it had been in the park! He would make a last\r\neffort to save Jill’s strength, and perhaps her life. If they could only\r\nhalt on that large clump of trees at the top of the great curving hill\r\nthey were now flying up, all might be well; Cocktail might be persuaded\r\nto turn back again.\r\n\r\nHe put on his utmost speed, and overtook his leader.\r\n\r\n“Cocktail,” he said, “dear captain, will you perch for a moment on these\r\ntrees to let the others come up?”\r\n\r\nCocktail was really fond of Feltie, whereas he only patronized Jill and\r\ntolerated Jack. He also felt that he had been harsh, and was willing to\r\nbe gracious once more. He agreed to halt, and when they reached the\r\ntrees he turned round to the wind and gave his loudest “Chak-chak.” But\r\nthere were no birds in sight.\r\n\r\nThey waited a moment, Feltie’s heart fluttering; Cocktail sitting\r\nstrongly on his bough, with head erect. Then he called again, and then\r\nagain. After that there was a long silence. Feltie dared not break it;\r\nCocktail was too proud to do so. Not a living creature was in sight; not\r\na labourer returning to his fireside; not a rook, not a rabbit. There\r\nwere tracks of four-footed creatures on the snow below the clump of\r\ntrees, but all was deadly still, except the branches as they swayed in\r\nthe bitter wind.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the shriek of an engine coming from the distant town broke in\r\non the silence, and gave Feltie a kind of courage.\r\n\r\n“Let us go back,” he said, “and find them. Jill can’t go on, I feel\r\nsure, and Jack has stayed with her. Let us go back and pass the night in\r\nthe park.”\r\n\r\n“Feltie,” said Cocktail, “I never guessed you were such a coward. _You_\r\nwant to stay behind too, do you? Go back and join Jack and Jill; the\r\nberries won’t last so long as the frost, and you will be less able then\r\nto fly further south. There you’ll stay, and there perhaps you’ll die;\r\nand I shall never see you again. Why can’t you trust in me? I expected\r\nto be obeyed, and you are all rebelling and deserting me!”\r\n\r\nFeltie made up his mind in a moment. Jack and Jill must take care of\r\nthemselves; he and Cocktail must hold together. A shade of pity crossed\r\nhis mind for Cocktail’s disappointment. “He was meant to lead,” he\r\nthought, “and we are not giving him a fair chance. Whatever happens I\r\nwill stick to him, and perhaps he will need my help yet.”\r\n\r\n“I am ready,” he said; “I will not leave you.”\r\n\r\n“That’s a good fellow,” said Cocktail. “Now fly your best; the sun must\r\nbe sinking soon, for though it is all cloudy, I can see a faint pink\r\nlight on the hills we left behind us this morning. Remember how easily\r\nwe got across them, and what a good supper we found on the other side.\r\nWe shall soon be across these hills too, and then we will find another\r\ngarden and more holly-trees.” And off he flew.\r\n\r\nCocktail was quite himself again, but he had reckoned without his host:\r\nhow was he, poor bird, to know what the Marlborough Downs were like in\r\nwinter? How was he to guess that instead of reaching some deep warm\r\nvalley at sunset, they might fly on till after dark, and indeed perhaps\r\nall through the night, without a chance of escaping from that terrible\r\nwind? Long, undulating plains, all shrouded in white; rounded hills,\r\nwhose dim whiteness melted into leaden gray as it met the snow-laden\r\nclouds; here and there a shelterless dip, down which the wind swept\r\nalmost more wildly than on the open plain: between these they had to\r\nchoose, if choose they would: and as one was no better than the other,\r\nthey went straight on.\r\n\r\nAt last they reached a rather deeper and wider hollow, at the bottom of\r\nwhich a large road ran.[4] A high bank sheltered this road to the north,\r\nand at the top of the bank was a hedge. It was now dark, blowing and\r\nsnowing furiously.\r\n\r\n“This is our only chance, Feltie,” said Cocktail: “but see there where\r\nthe road turns a little; there we can get a better shelter.”\r\n\r\nAnd here, just where an old ruined turnpike cottage stood between the\r\nroad and the bank, with long brown grass growing behind it, they settled\r\ndown for the night--a night which few who live on those downs will ever\r\nforget. Feltie himself used afterwards to say that they must have died,\r\nbut for one solitary piece of good fortune. The two birds had crouched\r\ndown in the long grass at the foot of the bank close to each other, and\r\nput their heads under their wings, but sleep would not come; they were\r\ntoo hungry and too wretched. Some time after dark a rustling was heard\r\nin the frozen grass; some four-footed creature was coming.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Thus they passed the night, tolerably warm and\r\ncomfortable, and even sleeping.--P. 19.]\r\n\r\n“Fox!” whispered Cocktail; “but I can’t fly, and if I could, where\r\nshould we go? It’s all up, I fear, but crouch closer in the grass and\r\nsee.”\r\n\r\nIt was not a fox; it was a hare. Puss came softly in behind the ruined\r\ncottage, and crouched down quietly close to the birds. They kept\r\nperfectly still. When she was fast asleep Cocktail whispered to Feltie\r\nto move up to her, and did so himself, getting as near her warm breath\r\nas possible. Feltie followed his example. And thus they passed the\r\nnight, tolerably warm and comfortable, and even sleeping. Puss never\r\noffered to stir, and was still fast asleep when they left her in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nThe next day, no breakfast. Not a morsel of food was to be found\r\nanywhere. The fields were deep in snow. Once they tried a rickyard, but\r\nthe farmer’s son came out with his gun, and they had to take to flight\r\nagain, frightened out of their lives. Their wings were getting feeble,\r\nand they often had to alight on the ground and rest; and after resting,\r\nevery fresh starting was more difficult than the last. Cocktail said\r\nlittle, and seemed to be getting deaf and sleepy; Feltie had to take\r\nthe lead and keep the lookout. They passed at midday over some\r\nlower-lying country,[5] and then, almost without knowing it, they once\r\nmore found themselves upon a high, bleak table-land of never-ending\r\ndown.[6] As night fell they sank quite exhausted on the sheltered side\r\nof a high hill, whose flanks were clothed thickly with gorse, hoping\r\nthat some friendly hare might again favour them with her company.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the night Cocktail suddenly spoke: “Feltie,” he said,\r\n“we ought to have stayed in that park. If I had known what was coming I\r\nwould have stayed, but one can’t know everything. You may have to go on\r\nwithout me to-morrow; if I can’t fly, you must go on. I’m your leader,\r\nand this is my last order. Go on till you get food, and when the frost\r\ngoes, come back this way if you care to. If you don’t find me, tell Jack\r\nand Jill that they were right, and I was wrong. Good-night once more,\r\nold Feltie; mind and do as I tell you.”\r\n\r\nCocktail said these last words with something of his old cheerful tone\r\nof authority; then he put his head under his wing again. Feltie said\r\nnothing, but nestled closer to him. When morning broke, and Feltie\r\nruffled his feathers and looked about him as usual, Cocktail did not do\r\nthe same. His head was still under his wing, but not a feather stirred;\r\nCocktail was dead, and frozen hard. Feltie shuddered and flew away,\r\nhardly knowing where he went.\r\n\r\nIt did not indeed much matter which way he went. Death was all around.\r\nThe only living creature abroad was a wandering carrion crow, whose\r\nmelancholy croak seemed to tell that he too was starving. The broad\r\nwhite pall lay silently over the whole plain; the sky was still\r\novercast, and the wind blew from the north-east with hardly less cruel\r\nviolence than on the day before. It was more the wind than his own wings\r\nthat carried Feltie along. Those wings were stiff and painful, and would\r\ndo their work no longer. And he, too, like poor Cocktail, was getting\r\ndrowsy with hunger and fatigue; life was going slowly out of him. He did\r\nnot feel much pain; he simply kept getting every minute more tired, more\r\nsleepy, and, strange to say, more comfortable.\r\n\r\nAfter a time he came to the edge of a steep hill, at the foot of which\r\nwas a straggling village. It looked desolate enough, for the thatched\r\nroofs were covered with snow, and tall elms above them swayed in the\r\nhowling wind. Beyond the village were some flat meadows, full of\r\nditches, and divided by a stream not yet quite frozen over; on the other\r\nside of the meadows the downs rose steeply again. Feltie had not enough\r\nlife left in him to feel that there was any hope for him in this valley;\r\nhe was simply drifting like a dead leaf or a snowflake, and it little\r\nmattered where he stopped. Somewhere the leaf would settle and decay,\r\nsomewhere the snowflake would drop and melt: somewhere too the poor\r\nstarving bird must rest from his last flight, and sink into a\r\nnever-ending sleep. The wind took him over the brow of the hill, and\r\nwith a series of little flights, ever growing shorter and feebler, he\r\nmade his way down the white slope, and settled, almost stupefied, under\r\nthe leeward side of a large barn, which stood close to a farmhouse on\r\nthe outskirts of the village. There he sat crouching, his head sunk into\r\nhis neck, his tail and wings drooping, his eyes half closed--a very\r\ndifferent bird from the Feltie who had started on his journey three days\r\nbefore, quite unconscious of trouble and pain.\r\n\r\nWhat was this? Human voices, laughter, coming round the corner of the\r\nbarn! Feltie had never been so near a human being before. He tried to\r\nfly, but it was impossible; no strength was left. His heart beat, and he\r\ncrouched closer to the ground. Then two small ploughboys, shouting and\r\nsnowballing each other, burst round the barn; the foremost, seeing\r\nFeltie, at once ran up and seized him, thus offering a splendid aim to\r\nhis pursuer, who sent a snowball at him which took deadly effect on him.\r\nBut the first boy popped Feltie into his pocket, and ran off, crying out\r\nas he ran:\r\n\r\n“I’se got a bird: thee sha’n’t have none of un!”\r\n\r\nDown the village street he ran, making for his father’s cottage, but had\r\ngot no farther than the vicarage gate, which was half way down the\r\nstreet, when another well-compacted snowball, delivered from behind the\r\ngate, knocked his hat off into the road, and filled one ear with snow\r\nwhich at once began to trickle gently down his neck. He looked up with a\r\nred face, and saw the vicar’s son, a boy of fourteen, swinging on the\r\ngate and laughing with all his might.\r\n\r\n“Oh, that was a beauty!” he said: “Oh, that was a tickler for you,\r\nBill!”\r\n\r\n“Thou beest a beast,” was Bill’s reply. He didn’t mean a pun, but\r\nperhaps there was a pleasant emphasis in the doubled syllable. “Thou\r\nbeest a beast, thou beest.”\r\n\r\n“What’s that?” said the swinger on the gate suddenly jumping down. “What\r\nam I? I’ll teach you--” But Bill did not stop to hear what he was to be\r\ntaught. He took to his heels again and ran like a deer. But the vicar’s\r\nson was more than a match for awkward Bill at running, and in less than\r\na hundred yards he collared him and had him down in a twinkling on the\r\nsnow in the deserted street.\r\n\r\n“I’ll teach you to call me names, you young cad.” And he began his\r\nlesson by scientifically “bagging” Bill’s wind.\r\n\r\n“Doan’t thee pummel I, doan’t thee now,” said panting Bill. “I’ll gi’\r\nthee a bird I’se got in my pocket, if thee woan’t pummel I no more.”\r\n\r\n“Where’s the bird? Get up and show it me directly, you young lubber,”\r\nsaid his conqueror, keeping a fast hold of his prisoner’s collar, the\r\nbetter to secure the execution of the bargain. Bill sulkily obeyed, and\r\nproduced Feltie from his pocket. But the jolting and banging produced by\r\nBill’s headlong flight in his heavy hob-nailed boots had been too much\r\nfor Feltie; he still breathed, but his eyes were shut and he was in fact\r\nquite unconscious of what was going on. The vicar’s boy let go Bill’s\r\ncollar, and taking Feltie in both hands, began to walk back to the\r\nvicarage gate.\r\n\r\nIn two minutes he and Feltie were in the snug warm drawing-room of the\r\nvicarage, where his mother and three sisters were sitting by the fire at\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n“My _dear_ George,” said the mother from her armchair as the boy came\r\nin, “how can you go out a day like this without a greatcoat? And what in\r\nthe world have you got there?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be frightened, mother,” said George, as he sat down on the\r\nhearthrug to thaw; “it’s only a fieldfare.”\r\n\r\n“What is a fieldfare, George?” asked his youngest sister.\r\n\r\n“First of all, Miss Minnie,” answered George, “a fieldfare is a bird;\r\nsecondly, it’s a kind of thrush; thirdly, it only comes here in winter;\r\nfourthly, it eats berries; and fifthly, if you don’t go and get some\r\nbrandy quickly, this one will die, for it’s all skin and bone, and\r\nhasn’t had the ghost of a berry inside it this last week, _I_ should\r\nsay.”\r\n\r\n“Brandy, George! Who ever heard of a bird drinking brandy!”\r\n\r\n“Now do you ladies want to save this bird’s life, or do you not?” said\r\nMaster George impatiently. “Because if you do, Minnie will go and shut\r\nup the cat and dog, and Edith go and get some drops of brandy, and Katie\r\nwill get me a quill pen to pour the brandy down his throat with, and\r\nmother--”\r\n\r\n“And mother will take care of the bird until George has changed his\r\njacket, for he’s dripping on to the hearthrug like old Father\r\nChristmas,” said the mother, and quietly took Feltie out of his hand\r\ninto her lap, where she began to stroke him gently. “Now, George, make\r\nhaste, or he’ll die before you’re down again.”\r\n\r\nThey all ran off on their several commissions, and when George came down\r\nagain, still putting on his jacket in his hurry, they were all assembled\r\nround the mother, who had Feltie on a napkin in her lap, and was cutting\r\na quill pen into a proper shape for giving him the first and last\r\nmedicine he ever had in his life. George held the bird’s beak open,\r\nwhile she deftly contrived to slip a single drop of brandy in half a\r\nteaspoonful of water down his throat; in five minutes she gave him\r\nanother dose, and then another; and now Feltie’s eyes opened wide, and\r\nhis feathers began to quiver slightly all over him.\r\n\r\n“Now, mother, put your two hands over him, and keep him quite warm for a\r\nbit. He’ll do, I expect,” said George.\r\n\r\nIt was a bold experiment to give a bird brandy-and-water, but on this\r\noccasion it answered its purpose. In another hour or two Feltie was able\r\nto eat a few shreds of meat, which were given him at the suggestion of\r\nthe vicar, who had now come in, and was taking much interest in his\r\nrecovery. Then he wanted to go to sleep, but the bright light of the\r\nroom made him feel very uncomfortable, and the loud human voices sounded\r\nharsh and strange in his ears. There was much discussion as to where he\r\nshould be put for the night; but the vicar decided that he should sleep\r\nin the conservatory, which was warmed with hot water. So they carried\r\nhim there in procession, and left him in a warm corner on a heap of the\r\ngardener’s matting, with plenty of scraps of meat and crumbs, and a\r\nsaucer of water if he should be thirsty in the night. So Feltie fell\r\nfast asleep, and dreamt of poor Cocktail all alone and frozen under the\r\ngorse on Salisbury plain; and George too fell fast asleep in his snug\r\nbed, and dreamt that a whole flock of fieldfares were come to the\r\nvicarage, asking for brandy-and-water to be given them with a quill pen.\r\n\r\nNext morning George was down betimes, half dressed, and in a state of\r\ngreat excitement, to see how his fieldfare was getting on. But Feltie\r\nwas awake still earlier, and had already taken his breakfast when\r\nGeorge opened the conservatory door. He felt quite strong again, and\r\nwith his strength had returned all his dread of human beings. So no\r\nsooner was the boy inside the door, than he began to flutter among the\r\nplants, and then flew up to the glass roof and tried to struggle through\r\nit. Then he came down again, and smelling the fresh air coming through\r\nthe door, was attracted in that direction, and in another minute was\r\nfree. Off went George after him--over the garden wall, where he dropped\r\na slipper, for he had not had time to put on his boots; across the road,\r\nthrough the hedge, which tore his trousers and scratched his face; over\r\nthe orchard, and up into the stubble-field beyond, where a shepherd who\r\nwas tending the new-born lambs that had been dropped in spite of the\r\nsnowstorm, was much astonished to see the vicar’s son tearing along\r\nwithout a hat, without his boots, and with his usually neat collar\r\nflying behind him secured by only a single button. But still Feltie went\r\non, and George, seeing that he was able to shift for himself, gave up\r\nthe pursuit, and consoled himself by a talk with the shepherd about the\r\nyoung lambs and their mothers, before he went home to dress and tell\r\nhis tale.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Feltie had perched on a hedge some distance away, and began to\r\nlook about him. “What was this he felt? Surely it was not so cold, and\r\nthe wind was blowing gently from the south-west. Was not the snow\r\nmelting?” (Master George’s right foot had found that out as soon as he\r\ngot over the garden-wall.) “Was not it beginning to rain?”\r\n\r\n“Chak-chak! Chak-chak!” cried Feltie, suddenly finding his voice: “the\r\nstorm is over, the fields will be soft again, the worms will come to the\r\nsurface, and perhaps the sun will shine again soon! Chak-chak!”\r\n\r\nHis voice was answered feebly from a distance. Then over a hedge came\r\nhalf-a-dozen fieldfares, flying weakly, as he had done the day before.\r\nHe joined them, and they gave him welcome, and told him how they too had\r\ngone southwards, a brave band of fifteen, of whom only six were now\r\nalive; how they had gone on and on till they had reached a stormy sea\r\nwhich they were too weak to cross; and how they had turned back again\r\nin despair, and were now returning northwards.\r\n\r\nFeltie told them his story too; and then the seven set out on their\r\njourney; and in the afternoon the sun shone warmly out of the rainy\r\nclouds, the lark rose in the air and sang, the robins sat on moist twigs\r\nand cheered them with a strain as they passed; the streams rose, full of\r\nmelting snow, and rushed over their banks into the meadows, moistening\r\nthem and making them soft and pleasant to the searching bills of hungry\r\nbirds: the air was soft, wet, and delicious, and in the fields they\r\nheard the bleating of the young lambs, and the calls of neighbouring\r\nparties of fieldfares and redwings.\r\n\r\nAt last when they neared the familiar spot which Feltie had left but a\r\nfew days before, he bade farewell to his fellow-travellers and turned\r\nwith a beating heart in the direction of the well-known elm-trees,\r\nstanding in the flat meadows where the stream wound here and there under\r\nits brambly archway.\r\n\r\nHis loud “chak-chak” was answered: there were some old friends there\r\nstill. There was Jill: and there too was Jack: they had saved their\r\nlives, then, by staying in the friendly park among the thorn-trees. But\r\nthat terrible storm had done its work upon the little company: more than\r\nhalf were still missing, and Feltie himself was almost the last\r\nstraggler to arrive. Many an adventure had to be narrated, and many a\r\nstory of struggle for life and death; but there was none so thrilling as\r\nthe winter’s tale that Feltie had to tell, and no loss so sadly to be\r\nbewailed as the death of the brilliant Cocktail in the gorse on the\r\ndreary frozen down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUT OF TUNE.\r\n\r\n            “Spirits are not finely touched\r\n    But to fine issues.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a certain manufacturing town, of no great size, there lived a\r\nmusician. For the most part he gained his living by playing at concerts\r\nand giving lessons; but he was young, ardent, and clever, and he had\r\nalways nursed a hope that he might one day be a great composer. He felt\r\na soul of music within him, that wanted to come out and express itself.\r\nBut, though he had had a complete training in composition, and had\r\nwritten much music and published a little, no one took any notice of\r\nwhat he composed; it was too good to sell well (so he used to say, and\r\nperhaps it was true), and he had never had a chance of having any of his\r\nlarger works performed in public. And he began to get rather irritable\r\nand impatient, so that his wife was sometimes at her wits’ end to know\r\nhow to cheer him up and set him to work once more with a good heart.\r\n\r\nGreat was the poor man’s delight when one day a letter arrived from the\r\ntown clerk, to tell him that on the approaching visit of the Prince of\r\nWales to open the new Town Hall, a grand concert was to be given, in\r\nwhich works by natives of the town were to be performed; and that he was\r\ninvited to write a short cantata for voices and orchestra. A liberal sum\r\nwas to be paid him, and he was to train his own choir, to have the best\r\nartists from London to help him, and to conduct his composition himself.\r\nThe news put him in such a state of high spirits that now the prudent\r\nwife was obliged to pour a little cold water on his ambition, and tell\r\nhim that he must not expect too much success all at once. But she made\r\nhim comfortable in their little parlour, and kept the neighbours from\r\nbreaking in upon his work; and for some time the cantata went on at a\r\nflowing pace, until nearly half of it was done.\r\n\r\nAfter a while however the musician’s brain began to rebel against being\r\nkept in all day hard at work, and to refuse to keep quiet and rest in\r\nsoothing sleep at night. It said as plainly as possible--“If you will go\r\non driving me in harness all day long, I shall be obliged to fidget at\r\nnight, and what is more, it is quite impossible for me to do such good\r\nwork in the day as I used to. So take your choice: either you must give\r\nme repose sometimes, or I must cease to be able to find you beautiful\r\nmelodies, and to show you how to treat them to the best advantage.” But\r\nthe musician did not know that his brain was complaining in this way,\r\nthough his wife heard it quite well; and he went on driving it harder\r\nthan ever, whipping it up and spurring it on, though it had hardly any\r\nstrength left to pull the cantata along with it. And all this time he\r\nwas shutting himself away from his friends, who used formerly to come\r\noften and refresh him with a friendly chat in the evenings; he refused\r\nto go with his wife and visit the very poor people whom they had been\r\nin the habit of comforting out of their slender store; he lost his\r\ntemper several times with his pupils, and one day boxed a boy’s ears for\r\nplaying a wrong note twice over, so that the father threatened to summon\r\nhim before the magistrates and have him fined for assault; and his wife\r\nbegan at last to fear that his stroke of good luck had done him more\r\nharm than good.\r\n\r\nOne morning he got up after a restless night, in which his poor brain\r\nhad been complaining as usual without being taken any notice of, and\r\nsettled himself down in the parlour after breakfast with the cantata,\r\nfeeling worried and tired both in his body and mind. With great labour\r\nand trouble he finished the last chorus of his first part, and uttered a\r\nsigh of relief. The next thing to be done was to write the first piece\r\nof the second part, which was to be an air for a single voice, and was\r\nto be sung at the concert by one of the best singers in the country. All\r\nthe rest of the cantata had been thought out carefully before he began\r\nto write; but this song, for which beautiful words were chosen from an\r\nold poet, had never worked itself out in his brain so as to satisfy him.\r\nAnd now the poor brain was called upon for inspiration, just at a time\r\nwhen it was hardly fit even to do clerk’s work.\r\n\r\nHe tried to spur it up with a pipe of tobacco, but not a bit would it\r\nbudge. Then he took a dose of _sal volatile_; but the effect of it only\r\nlasted a few minutes, and then he felt even more stupid than before.\r\nThen he opened the window and looked out into their little back-garden,\r\njust as a gleam of sunshine shot down through a murky sky. This made him\r\nfeel a little better, and he returned to his desk, and sat for a few\r\nmoments looking at the words which he was to set to music, feeling\r\nalmost as if he were now going to make a little way. But the sunshine\r\nhad also made the canary in the window feel a little warm-hearted, and\r\nit burst out into such a career of song, that the room seemed to be\r\nechoing all over with its strains. And all his own music fled at once\r\nout of the distracted composer’s head.\r\n\r\n“You little noisy fiend!” he cried angrily, “putting in your miserable\r\nlittle twopenny pipe, when a poor human artist is struggling to sing.\r\nDon’t you know, you little wretch, that art is long and time is\r\nfleeting?”\r\n\r\nHe jumped up, took down the cage with an ungentle hand, and carried it\r\ninto another room, where he drew a heavy shawl over it and shut the\r\ndoor. The canary’s song was stifled, but the musician’s song was not a\r\nbit the better for it. And after a while there came another annoyance.\r\nThe house was small and not very solidly built, and though the room\r\nwhere he was at work did not look out on the street, any street-calls,\r\nbands, hurdy-gurdys, or such like noise-making enemies, could be heard\r\nthere quite distinctly. This time it was a street-boy whistling a tune;\r\nit was not a bad tune, and it was whistled with a good heart; indeed the\r\nboy put so much energy into his performance, that he must have been in\r\nvery high spirits. And why did he stop there so long? Generally they\r\npassed by, and the tails of their tunes disappeared in the distance, or\r\nthey turned down the next street. But this one was clearly stopping\r\nthere on purpose to annoy the composer.\r\n\r\nHe went softly into the front room, keeping out of sight from the\r\nwindow. He was seized with a desire to wreak vengeance on this\r\ntormentor, but he was not quite clear how to do it, and must survey his\r\nground first. Stepping behind the window-curtain, he peeped out between\r\nthe curtain and the window-frame, and saw a small boy, whistling hard,\r\nwith a long string in his hand, which descended into the area below. The\r\nmusician stood on tiptoe, and looked down into the area; it was a sort\r\nof relief to him to see what this urchin was about. At the end of the\r\nstring he perceived a dead mouse, which was being made to jump up and\r\ndown and counterfeit life, as well as was possible under the\r\ncircumstances, for the benefit of a young cat of the household, who was\r\nlying in wait for it, springing on it, and each time finding it drawn\r\naway from her just as she thought her claws were fast fixed in it. This\r\nboy was in fact an original genius, who had invented this way of amusing\r\nhimself; he called it cat-fishing, and it was excellent sport.\r\n\r\nThe musician suddenly flung up the window, and faced the boy, who seemed\r\nby no means disconcerted; he only left off whistling and looked hard at\r\nthe musician.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing with the cat?” said the latter, with all the dignity\r\nhe could put on. “What business have you to meddle with my cat, and make\r\nthat infernal din in front of my house?”\r\n\r\nThe boy began slowly to haul up the string, looking all the while\r\nsteadily at the composer.\r\n\r\n“I say, guv’nor,” he said, with a mock show of friendly interest, “do\r\nyou know as you’ve got a blob of ink at the end o’ your nose?”\r\n\r\nThe composer was taken aback. He certainly did not know it, but nothing\r\nwas more likely, considering how he had been pulling his moustache and\r\nscratching his head with fingers which, as he glanced at them, showed\r\nsome traces of ink. He put his hand involuntarily to his nose, and half\r\nturned to the glass over the chimney-piece. There was not a stain there:\r\nthe nose was innocent of ink. Instantly he returned to the window, but\r\nthe boy was gone; all that was left of him was a distant sound of\r\n“There’s nae luck aboot the house” far down the street. The composer\r\nwent gloomily back to his study, without a particle of music in his\r\nbrain; the canary and the whistler had driven it all away. He sat down\r\nmechanically at his desk, but he might as well have sat down at the\r\nkitchen-table and tried to make it play like a piano.\r\n\r\nHe got up once more, and looked out of the window. The sun was again\r\nshining, and the little garden, fenced in between brick walls which\r\ncaught the sunshine, and enlivened with a few annuals (for it was early\r\nsummer), did not look altogether uninviting. At the end of it was a\r\nlittle arbour which he had built himself, and a rose tree that he had\r\nplanted against it was already beginning to blossom. The composer\r\nthought he would go and quiet himself down in this little arbour, and\r\ntry and get his thoughts fixed upon the air he was to write. Out he\r\nwent, and seated there, began to feel more at ease. After a while he\r\nbegan to think once more of the old poet’s lines; and feeling as if\r\nmusic were coming into his brain again, went and fetched his manuscript\r\nand his pen and ink, to be ready in case he should have musical thoughts\r\nto write down.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there broke in upon his peace the loud, shrill song of a wren.\r\nIt was close to him, just outside the arbour; and when a wren sings\r\nclose to you, it pierces your ears like the shrillest whistle ever blown\r\nby schoolboy. It was all unconscious of the presence of the composer so\r\nclose to its nest, which it had built in the branches of the rose-tree\r\nthat climbed up outside; and it hopped down for a moment on the gravel\r\njust in front of the arbour to pick up some fragment of food. The\r\ncomposer’s nerves were quite unstrung by its sudden outburst of\r\nself-asserting song; it was an insult to music, to the poet, and to\r\nhimself. No sooner did the tiny bird appear, as complacent and hearty as\r\nall wrens are, than he seized the ink-bottle, and like Luther at\r\nWittemburg, flung it wildly at the little fiend that thus dared to\r\ndisturb his peace. Of course he missed his aim; of course he broke the\r\nink-bottle and spilt the ink; and alas! when he returned from picking up\r\nthe bits, a splash from the bottle had fallen in a grand slanting puddle\r\nover the neat manuscript of the last page of the chorus which concluded\r\nhis second part. And as he stood beholding it in dismay, lo! the voice\r\nof that irrepressible little wren, as shrill and pert as ever, only a\r\nlittle further off!\r\n\r\nIf the musician had not quarrelled with his brain, and if the struggle\r\nbetween them had not put his nerves all out of tune--if he had been then\r\nthe gentle and sweet-tempered artist he generally was--he would have\r\nlaughed at the idea of such a little pigmy flouting him in this\r\nridiculous way. As it was, he growled under his breath that everything\r\nwas against him, crushed his hat on his head, took the manuscript into\r\nthe house and locked it up in a drawer, wrote a hurried note to his\r\nwife, who had gone put, to say he had gone for a long walk and would not\r\nbe back till late, and sallied out of the house where no peace was any\r\nlonger possible for him.\r\n\r\nHe walked fast, and was soon out of the town and among the lanes. They\r\nwere decked with the full bloom of the wild roses, and the meadows were\r\ngolden with buttercups; but these the composer did not even see. Birds\r\nsang everywhere, but he did not hear them. He was just conscious that\r\nthe sun was shining on him, but his eyes were fixed on the ground, and\r\nhis mind was so full of his own troubles that there was no room in it\r\nfor anything nicer to enter there. He was thinking that his song would\r\nnever be written, for he could not bear to write anything that should be\r\nunworthy of those words, or second-rate as music; and it seemed as if\r\nhis brain would never again yield him any music that he could be\r\nsatisfied with. “I shall be behindhand,” he thought to himself. “I shall\r\nhave to write and say I can’t carry out my undertaking; my one chance\r\nwill be lost, and all my hopes with it. I shall lose my reputation and\r\nmy pupils, and then there will be nothing left but beggary and a\r\nblighted life!” And he worked himself up into such a dreadful state that\r\nwhen he was crossing a river by a bridge, it did actually occur to him\r\nwhether it would not be as well to jump over the parapet and put an end\r\nto his troubles once for all. His mind was so full of himself that for a\r\nmoment he forgot even his wife and child, and all his friends and\r\nwell-wishers.\r\n\r\nHe stood by the parapet for some minutes looking over. The swallows and\r\nsand-martins were gliding up and down, backwards and forwards through\r\nthe bridge, catching their food and talking to themselves. A big trout\r\nrose to secure a mayfly from the deep pool below, and sent a circle of\r\nwavelets spreading far and wide. A kingfisher flashed under the bridge,\r\nall blue and green, and shot away noiselessly up the stream; and then a\r\nred cow or two came down to drink, and after drinking stood in the water\r\nup to their knees, and looked sublimely cool and comfortable. And the\r\nriver itself flowed on with a gentle rippling talk in the sunshine,\r\nhushing as it entered the deep pool, and passing under the bridge slowly\r\nand almost silently--“like an _andante_ passing into an _adagio_,” said\r\nthe musician to himself; and he walked on with eyes no longer fixed on\r\nthe ground, for even this little glimpse of beauty from the bridge had\r\nbeen medicine to the brain, and it wanted more--it wanted to see and to\r\nhear more things that were beautiful and healing.\r\n\r\nHe went on, still gloomy, but his gloom was no longer an angry and\r\nsullen one. Through his eyes and ears came sensations that gradually\r\ngladdened his heart, and relieved the oppression on his brain: he began\r\nto notice the bloom on the hedges and in the fields; and the singing of\r\nthe larks high in air, though he hardly attended to it, made part of the\r\njoyousness of nature which was beginning to steal into his weary being.\r\nPresently he came to a little hamlet, hardly more than a cottage or two,\r\nbut with a little church standing at right angles to the road. The\r\nchurchyard looked inviting, for rose-bushes were blooming among the\r\ngraves, and it was shut out from the road by a high wall, so that he\r\nwould be unobserved there. He walked in and sat down on a tombstone to\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nHe had not been there long, and was beginning to feel calmed and\r\nquieted, when there broke out on him from the ivied wall the very same\r\nshrill wren’s song that had so wounded his feelings in the morning. It\r\nsent a momentary pang through him. There started up before his eyes the\r\nbroken ink-bottle, the smeared page, the bitter vexation and worry, and\r\nthe song not even yet begun. But the battle of body and brain was no\r\nlonger being waged, and as the tiny brown bird sang again and again, and\r\nalways the same strain, he began to wonder how such cheerful music\r\ncould ever have so maddened him. It brought to his mind a brilliant bit\r\nof _Scarlatti_, in which a certain lively passage comes up and up again,\r\nalways the same, like a clear, strong spring of water bubbling up with\r\nunflagging energy, and with a never-failing supply of joyousness. And\r\nthe wren and _Scarlatti_ getting the better of him, he passed out of the\r\nchurchyard, and actually began to feel that he was hungry.\r\n\r\nJust across the road was a thatched cottage, standing in a little garden\r\ngay with early summer flowers; beehives stood on each side of the\r\nentrance, and a vine hung on the walls. It looked inviting, and the\r\nmusician stepped over the little stile, and tapped at the door, which\r\nwas open. A woman of middle age came forward.\r\n\r\n“Can you tell me,” said he, “whether there is an inn anywhere near where\r\nI could get some bread and cheese?”\r\n\r\nShe answered that there was no inn nearer than the next village, two\r\nmiles away. “But you look tired and pale, sir. Come in and have a\r\nmorsel before you go on; and a cup of tea will be like to do you good.\r\nSit you down in the porch and rest a bit, and I’ll bring you something\r\nin a moment.”\r\n\r\nThe musician thanked her, and sat down in the porch by the beehives. It\r\nwas delicious there!--bees, flowers, sunshine; on the ground the shadows\r\nof the vine-leaves that were clustering unkempt above his head; in the\r\ndistance golden meadows and elm-trees, and the faint blue smoke of the\r\ntown he had left behind him. Outside the porch hung a cage, in which was\r\na skylark, the favourite cage-bird of the poor; it had been interrupted\r\nin its song by the stranger’s arrival, but now began again, and sang\r\nwith as good a heart and as lusty a voice as its free brethren in the\r\nblue of heaven.\r\n\r\n“What a stream of song!” thought the musician. “He sings like good old\r\nHaydn! We can’t do that now. We don’t pour out our hearts in melody, and\r\ndo just what we like with our tunes.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “How that bird does sing.”--P. 49.]\r\n\r\nThe lark ceased for a moment, and the ticking of the big clock within\r\nthe cottage suddenly called up in his mind the _andante_ of the _Clock\r\nSymphony_, and the two bassoons ticking away in thirds with that\r\npeculiar comical solemnity of theirs; and he leant back in the porch and\r\nlaughed inside himself till the lark began to sing again. Then he went\r\non mentally to the last _allegro vivace_, and caught up by its\r\nextraordinary force and vivacity, his brain was dancing away in a flood\r\nof delicious music, when the woman came out to him with a cup of tea and\r\nbread and butter.\r\n\r\n“How that bird does sing!” he said to her. “It has done me worlds of\r\ngood already!”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” she answered, “he has been a good friend to us too. It was my boy\r\nthat gave him to me--him as is away at sea. He sings pretty nigh all the\r\nyear round, and sometimes he do make a lot of noise; but we never gets\r\ntired of him, he minds us so of our lad. Ah, ’tis a bad job when your\r\nonly boy will go for to be a sailor. I never crosses the road to church\r\nof a stormy morning and sees the ripples on the puddles, but I thinks of\r\nthe stormy ocean and my poor son!”\r\n\r\nThe musician asked more about the sailor; and he was shown his likeness,\r\nand various relics of him that the fond mother had cherished up. And\r\nwhen he rose to go he shook hands with the woman warmly, and told her\r\nthat he would one day bring his wife and ask for another cup of tea.\r\nThen he started off once more, refreshed as much by the milk of human\r\nkindness as by the tea and bread and butter.\r\n\r\nHe soon began to feel sleepy, and looked for a quiet spot where he could\r\nlie down in the shade. Crossing two or three fields he came to a little\r\ndingle, where a stream flowed by a woodside; on the other side was a\r\nmeadow studded with elms and beeches, and under the shade of one of\r\nthese, close to the brook, and facing the wood, he lay down, and was\r\nsoon fast asleep.\r\n\r\nHe was woke up by a musical note so piercing, yet so exquisitely sweet,\r\na _crescendo_ note of such wonderful power and volume, that he started\r\nup on his elbow and looked all round him. It was not repeated; but in a\r\nminute or two there came from the wood opposite him a liquid trill; then\r\nan inward murmur; then a loud jug-jug-jug; and then the nightingale\r\nbegan to sing in earnest, and carried the musician with him into a kind\r\nof paradise. He did not think now of the great composers; this was not\r\nBeethoven or Mozart; this was something new, and altogether rich and\r\nstrange. Every time the bird ceased he was in suspense as to what would\r\ncome next; and what came next was as surprising as what went before. At\r\nlast the nightingale ceased, and dropped into the thick underwood; but\r\nthe musician lay there still, and mused and dozed.\r\n\r\nAt length he started up and looked at his watch; it was past seven\r\no’clock. He hurried off homewards in the cool air, refreshed and\r\nquieted, thinking of nothing but the things around him, and now and then\r\nof the cottage, the lark, the brookside, and the nightingale. But\r\npresently there came into his recollection the old poet’s lines, and he\r\nrepeated them over to himself, for they seemed in harmony with his mood,\r\nand with the coolness, and the sunset. Then as a star comes out in the\r\ntwilight, there came upon his mind a strain worthy to be married to\r\nimmortal verse; like the star, it grew in brightness every moment, until\r\nhe could see it clear and full. In a moment paper and pencil were in his\r\nhand, and the thought was fixed beyond all fear of forgetting. By the\r\ntime he reached home, the whole strain was worked out in his mind, and\r\nhe wrote the first draft of it that same evening, as he sat contented in\r\nhis parlour, with his wife sewing by his side.\r\n\r\nAfter this nothing went wrong with the cantata. It was finished, it was\r\na great success, and the music to the old poet’s words was\r\nenthusiastically encored. The audience called loudly for the composer,\r\nand the Prince of Wales sent for him, and congratulated him warmly. And\r\nthe day after the concert he took his wife out into the country, and\r\nthey had tea at the cottage; the lark sang to them, the flowers were\r\nalive with murmuring bees, and the musician’s mind was free from all\r\ncare and anxiety.\r\n\r\nAs they sat there, he told his wife the whole story of that eventful\r\nday, not even keeping from her the thought that had passed through his\r\nmind on the bridge. When he had finished, she laid her hand on his, and\r\nsaid, in her comfortable womanly way--\r\n\r\n“You were out of tune, dear, that’s what it was. And you can’t make\r\nbeautiful music, if you’re out of tune: everything you see and hear\r\njars on you. You must tell me next time you feel yourself getting out of\r\ntune, and we’ll come out here and set you all right again.”\r\n\r\nThey went comfortably back to the town, after a day of complete\r\nhappiness. As they neared their own door, they saw the street-boy\r\nleaning again over their railings, and cat-fishing as usual in the area.\r\nHe was whistling with all his might; but this time it was “Weel may the\r\nkeel row.” They took it as a good omen; and the astonished urchin found\r\nhimself pounced on from behind, carried into the house by main force,\r\nand treated with cake, and all manner of good things, while the musician\r\nsat down to the piano and played him all the beautiful tunes he could\r\nremember. He did not come to fish in their area any more after this; but\r\na few days later he was heard whistling “Vedrai carino” with an\r\nabstracted air, as he leant over a neighbour’s railings, amusing himself\r\nwith his favourite pastime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA JUBILEE SPARROW.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 21st of June, 1887, a cock sparrow sat on the roof\r\nof St. James’s Palace, in London, gazing down now into St. James’s\r\nStreet, now into Pall Mall, where the preparations were almost finished\r\nfor the Jubilee which was to take place next day. Flags were being fixed\r\nat all the windows, and Chinese lanterns hung out for the illuminations;\r\nseats were being everywhere contrived for the spectators, and all was\r\nbustle and activity. Every one seemed in good humour; it was plain that\r\nall were bent on showing the good Queen who had reigned fifty years\r\nwithout a blot on her fair fame, that their hearts went out to her in\r\nsympathy and goodwill. Yet any one skilled in the ways of birds, who\r\ncould have seen the sparrow as he sat there, would have judged from the\r\nset of his feathers that _his_ mind was very far from being at ease.\r\n\r\n“There’s no time to lose,” he muttered to himself; “she’ll have to sit\r\nall day and all night, or we sha’n’t do it after all.” He flew down to a\r\nsnug corner behind a tall brick chimney looking to the south, where his\r\nwife was sitting on a nest with four eggs in it.\r\n\r\n“My dear,” he said; “you mustn’t leave the nest to-day; you know my\r\nhopes and wishes; you will disappoint me dreadfully if you can’t manage\r\nto hatch out an egg to-morrow. It really is our duty, as we live in a\r\npalace, to have a nestling hatched on the Jubilee day. Why, my people\r\nhave lived here ever since the Queen came to the throne, and one of my\r\nancestors was born on the very day of her accession! we must keep up the\r\ntradition, and, my dear, it all depends on you. Remember, I picked you\r\nout of a whole crowd down in St James’s Park, and I made no inquiries\r\nabout your connections; you may have come from a Pimlico slum for all I\r\nknow. But I saw you had good qualities and I asked no questions. Now do\r\ntry and do yourself justice. Sit close, and don’t on any account leave\r\nthe eggs, and I will bring you all sorts of good things from the Prince\r\nof Wales’ own kitchen.”\r\n\r\nThe hen sparrow fluttered her wings a little and meekly assured her\r\nhusband that she would do her best. “It’s hard work,” she added; “my\r\npoor breast is getting quite bare, and I’m so hungry. But I’ll sit till\r\nAugust to please you, you beautiful and noble bird.”\r\n\r\n“That’s right,” said the cock sparrow, much pleased; and indeed he was a\r\nfine bird, with his black throat and blue head, and mottled brown back.\r\nHe flew straight down to the back door of Marlborough House, where the\r\nPrince of Wales lives (he patronized no human beings but royalty and the\r\naristocracy), and finding the usual supply of crumbs and scraps put out\r\nby the royal kitchen-maid, he made a good meal first himself, and then\r\nset to work to carry his wife her supper.\r\n\r\nThe day was very hot and very long, and the warmth greatly helped the\r\nweary hen in performing her duties. She stuck to her post all the time\r\nshe was having her supper, and she knew that her eggs would soon be\r\nhatched; but neither she nor her husband had quite reckoned for the\r\nwarmth of the day. Just when the cock was going to roost, well satisfied\r\nwith his wife, and certain that his fondest hopes would be realized\r\nto-morrow, crack, crack! peep, peep! out came a tiny sparrow from the\r\negg in the warmest corner of the nest, full three hours before the\r\nJubilee day was to begin!\r\n\r\nShe called her husband--\r\n\r\n“Oh what a little darling,” she cried. “Oh, what a lovely little yellow\r\nbeak! and what a sweet crumply little red skin!” And she forgot all\r\nabout the Jubilee.\r\n\r\n“What a horrid little wretch you mean,” said the cock sparrow. “An\r\nimpudent, pushing little ugly brute, to come out just at the wrong time!\r\nAnd he would have seized it and thrust it out of the nest, if the poor\r\ndelighted mother had not spread her wings quite over it.\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t be so cruel,” she said, “please don’t; I’ll hatch another\r\nto-morrow, if I possibly can. I’ll sit all day, and never even want to\r\ngo and see the procession, as you promised I should.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said the cock. “You stay here and sit close till you’ve\r\nhatched another. Not one bit of food shall that little monster have from\r\nme, till his brother is born. And if he is _not_ born to-morrow, it’ll\r\nbe very much the worse for you, my dear!”\r\n\r\nHe went to roost again, and his wife cuddled herself down once more on\r\nthe eggs, and fondled her little new-born chick. All night long the\r\nhammering of boards went on in the streets below, where the preparations\r\nwere being finished for the procession, and the poor hen passed a very\r\nsleepless night. Her body was tired, and she was dreadfully afraid of\r\nher husband’s anger, if she should fail in her duty. “But, after all,”\r\nshe thought, “one must go through a good deal if one is to have a\r\nhusband who lives in a palace and is connected with the highest families\r\nin the land!”\r\n\r\nThe next day was, as we all remember, another very hot one. The sun\r\nblazed down upon the poor hen sparrow, who was obliged to keep sitting\r\nclose all day, until she really thought she must have died with heat and\r\nanxiety. Not for one minute would her husband allow her to leave the\r\nnest and look at the processions. He perched on a chimney whence he\r\ncould see her on the nest, and also see the procession coming through\r\nfrom Buckingham Palace; and he described it all to her from his chimney,\r\nbut what was the good of that? She might just as well have read it in\r\nthe newspapers the next morning.\r\n\r\nAll day long she sat on those three remaining eggs, and it really seemed\r\nas if they would never crack. The cock got more and more angry and\r\nimpatient. “We shall be disgraced,” he cried, when the processions were\r\nall over, and still no second chick; “we shall be disgraced, and we\r\nshall have to leave the Palace. I shall, at least; you may stay if you\r\nlike: you have no connection with the royal family and no sense of\r\nshame.”\r\n\r\nThe hen could say nothing. She was doing her best, poor thing, and she\r\ncould do no more. Hour after hour passed, and still no egg burst. At\r\nlast, as the big clock on the Palace struck seven, crack! peep!--a\r\nsecond little sparrow poked out its bill into this wicked world.\r\n\r\nThe cock sparrow was in a state of wild excitement. He pushed his wife\r\noff the nest, and declared he was going to take charge of it all\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n“Oh, what a beauty!” he exclaimed; “so different from that other little\r\nwretch! Fly at once, my dear, to Buckingham Palace, and let Her Majesty\r\nknow. She’ll be delighted. And only think if you were to bring back some\r\ncrumbs from the hand of royalty itself! I’ll take care of it meanwhile.”\r\n\r\nOff flew poor weary Mrs. Sparrow on her errand. But when she got to\r\nBuckingham Palace, she didn’t know how to find the Queen; so she flew\r\ndown into Palace Road, and picked up a crumb or two in front of a\r\nbaker’s shop there, which she brought home in her beak.\r\n\r\n“Well done!” cried her husband, without waiting to ask where they came\r\nfrom. “Crumbs from Her Majesty’s own hand! wasn’t she\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Jubilee Sparrow.--P. 61.]\r\n\r\ndelighted? Did she say it was to be called ‘Jubilee,’ in honour of the\r\nday? Of course she did. Jubilee he shall be; and there isn’t another\r\nyoung one in London to compare with him.”\r\n\r\nThere was indeed a terrible to-do made about this little nestling, which\r\nwas ugly enough in the eyes of every one but its parents. The news of it\r\nspread about, and from all parts of London sparrows came to see it. All\r\nsorts of tales were told of it, and the further you got from St.\r\nJames’s, the more wonderful they were. In the Strand they told how the\r\nbird broke the egg as the Queen was passing by, and how Her Majesty\r\nhappened to look up to see what o’clock it was, and seeing the old\r\nsparrow on the roof, bowed to him most graciously. Further east, the\r\nsparrows of St. Paul’s Cathedral narrated how a bird had been born on\r\nthe roof of Buckingham Palace, just over the Queen’s own bedroom window,\r\nand how Her Majesty, on hearing the news, had sent for a long ladder,\r\nand ordered the Lord Chamberlain to take up some choice dainties to the\r\nparents on a plate of solid gold. And far away in the East-end, the\r\nblack and sooty sparrows who inhabit those parts, and who firmly believe\r\nthemselves and their race to be the most important part of the whole\r\npopulation of London, were much stirred by a rumour that a sparrow had\r\nbeen born in the West-end, which had been declared by the Queen to be\r\nheir to the throne, and that the days of the rule of man were coming to\r\nan end, and the sparrows were going to have it all their own way.\r\n\r\nThus the fame of little Jubilee spread over the whole of London, and\r\neven into the country, for the sparrows that were going out of town for\r\nthe summer carried the news with them, and the whole world of sparrows\r\nwere in a few days chattering and quarrelling about it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Jubilee was being stuffed with all sorts of good things, and\r\nin the second week of his existence very nearly died of over-eating. If\r\nhe had been fed with wholesome flies, like the others, he would have\r\ntaken no hurt; but his father was always bringing bread-crumbs from the\r\nPrince of Wales’s back-door, and these, when forced down the wide-open\r\nyellow throat of poor Jubilee, were apt to choke him sadly.\r\n\r\n“Never mind,” said the father, “it will all help to strengthen his\r\nblood, and make him a fit neighbour for kings and princes!”\r\n\r\nLuckily the entreaties of his mother, who declared he would die if he\r\nwere not fed properly, had some effect, and Jubilee grew to be a\r\nfledgling without falling a victim to his own greatness. When he was\r\nready to leave the nest, the others, who had been carefully brought up\r\nto consider themselves nobodies, and to bow before Jubilee in\r\neverything, were told to go and shift for themselves--their mother might\r\nlook after them if she liked. As for Jubilee, he was to be under his\r\nfather’s care for a while longer, and to be introduced to the world\r\nwhere he was to cut such a great figure. He had by this time, as you may\r\nsuppose, come to think a good deal of himself; and to say the truth,\r\nthere was no such conceited young jackanapes of a sparrow to be found in\r\nthe whole of London. But all the parent sparrows had taught their young\r\nones to look up to him, and his high mightiness had things pretty much\r\nhis own way.\r\n\r\nThe royal families being by this time gone out of town, it was not\r\npossible to have him presented at court; so the father sparrow was\r\nobliged to be content with taking him to the water in the park, to\r\nintroduce him to the ducks. He did indeed drop a hint or two about going\r\nto Windsor Castle when Jubilee should be strong enough; but he had never\r\nbeen so far himself, and had some doubts in his own mind as to his\r\nreception by the rival sparrows of that royal residence. Supposing they\r\nhad produced a Jubilee sparrow there too! It might be wiser not to go so\r\nfar a-field.\r\n\r\nThe ducks were very gracious to Jubilee. They informed him that they\r\nwere the property of the state, and under the especial care and\r\npatronage of the nobility and gentry. They lamented that the royal\r\nprinces and princesses did not often come to feed them, and told him how\r\ntwo centuries ago, that excellent monarch Charles the Second had made it\r\na regular practise and duty to walk in the park for the purpose of\r\nthrowing bread to the ducks of that day. They said that Jubilee might\r\ncome every day and share the things that were given them.\r\n\r\nSo Jubilee led a happy life for a while in the society of the ducks, and\r\nbecame more vain than ever. He was very bold, and would hardly get out\r\nof the way of the passers-by. And this vanity and boldness led to a turn\r\nin the fortunes of this sadly spoilt young bird, which it is now our\r\npainful duty to relate.\r\n\r\nOne day he was left by his father with the Ducks, and was listening to\r\ntheir aristocratic conversation, taking a bathe in the water now and\r\nthen, and preening himself in the sunshine, when two very ragged and\r\ndirty boys came by. One of them had a large hunk of bread which he was\r\neating, and as he passed the ducks he threw them a few crumbs. The ducks\r\ndid not mind where they got their bread; whether it were given them by a\r\nmonarch or a street-boy was all the same to them; and young Jubilee of\r\ncourse did as they did. So it came to pass that he flew down from the\r\nbush where he happened to be perching at the moment, and dexterously\r\npicked up a crumb which had fallen just at the edge of the water.\r\n\r\nThe boys, seeing this, threw him another and then another, nearer and\r\nnearer to themselves; and Jubilee, in all his pride and self-confidence,\r\ncame close up to them. Suddenly one of the boys whipped off his cap, and\r\nflung it with such good aim, that it knocked over poor Jubilee, and half\r\nstunned him; the other boy instantly pounced down upon him, and he was a\r\nprisoner in a pair of grimy hands. He called out loud to the ducks, but\r\nthey only said “quack-quack,” and went off to the other side of the\r\nwater, as they saw no more bread was coming.\r\n\r\n“Serves him right!” said an old drake: “you ducks made such a fuss about\r\nthat little piece of impudence, that he was getting quite unbearable.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, to prevent his escape, as he struggled and pecked with all\r\nhis might, his captor put him into his pocket; where he found himself in\r\ncompany with a morsel of mouldy cheese, a half-eaten apple, two or three\r\nbits of string, the cork of a ginger-beer bottle, the head of a herring,\r\nand the bowl of an old clay pipe; all of which, combined with the\r\ndirtiness of the pocket itself, made up such a smell that Jubilee will\r\nnever forget it to the last day of his life. The only comfort was that\r\nthere was one place where light showed through the pocket; and for this\r\nhe made and tried to struggle out. The boy, feeling him struggling, gave\r\nhis pocket a slap, which quieted master Jubilee for a time; but after a\r\nwhile he recovered and began to make for fresh air again. This time the\r\nother boy saw his beak coming out and warned his companion in time; so\r\nJubilee was taken out, and they tied the poor prisoner’s legs together\r\nwith one of the bits of string, and put him into another pocket in\r\ncompany with a dead mouse. And now he had to lie still and take things\r\nas they came. He was tired out with fear, and struggling, and hardly had\r\nlife enough left in him to be angry or cry out.\r\n\r\nIt was some time before he was released from the company of the dead\r\nmouse. When he was taken out of the pocket, he found himself in a dark\r\nand grimy room, with hardly any furniture, no fireplace, and only one\r\nsmall window high up in the wall. What a change from St. James’s Palace!\r\nHe was in fact in the cellar of a small house in a back street in\r\nWestminster, where the father of the boys lived: a very poor man, whose\r\nwages were so small, even when he was lucky enough to get work, that he\r\ncould only afford to rent a cellar; and here he and his wife and their\r\ntwo boys lived.\r\n\r\nWhen the door was shut, Jubilee’s legs were untied and he was then put\r\ninto a small box, in the lid of which one of the boys had bored a few\r\nsmall holes to give him air. Some crumbs were dropped through the holes,\r\nbut they quite forgot to give him water, and the poor bird had to suffer\r\ngreat torments of thirst. When night came at last and the family lay\r\ndown on their wretched mattresses in the corners of the room, Jubilee\r\nexpected to get some sleep; but even this was denied him. No sooner was\r\nall quiet than the rats began to prowl about the room; and you may be\r\nsure they soon smelt out Jubilee. They came and climbed up on to the\r\nbox, and when they heard him inside, they began to gnaw the wood between\r\ntwo of the holes. Luckily the nights were still short, and the\r\npoverty-stricken family were stirring early, or they would have got at\r\nJubilee before morning. Even as it was, the poor bird, who used to sleep\r\nso peacefully after a good supper on the roof of the Royal Palace in the\r\nsnuggest corner of the nest, had to spend his whole night within a few\r\ninches of half-a-dozen hungry monsters, who were thirsting for his\r\nblood. He was almost out of his mind by morning.\r\n\r\nThe boys had each a piece of bread given them for breakfast, some crumbs\r\nfrom which they gave their prisoner; and at the instance of their\r\nmother, they also gave him some water, and Jubilee felt a little better,\r\nand began to forget about the rats. Suddenly there came a knock at the\r\ndoor. The father had gone to work; the mother opened it. A man in\r\nuniform came in. Jubilee thought it must be a special messenger from the\r\nQueen, come to demand his instant release.\r\n\r\nBut it was only the School Board attendance officer, who had come to see\r\nwhy the boys were not at school. They shrank into a corner and presently\r\nmade for the door, but the officer was too quick for them. He told\r\ntheir mother that he did not wish to have the father fined, and that if\r\nthe boys would go to the school with him at once, and promise to go\r\nregularly, he would not summon him. The boys were frightened and went\r\noff with the officer: and Jubilee was left alone with the mother, who\r\nnow began to try and clean up a bit, and make the room tidy; though,\r\nindeed, poor thing, she was too thin and starved to do any real work.\r\n\r\nSoon she came to the box where Jubilee was.\r\n\r\n“Ah, poor bird!” she thought to herself, “you have come out of fresh\r\nair, and away from kind friends, just as we did when we came to this\r\ndreadful London. Oh, why did I ever leave the village, and father and\r\nmother, and the orchards, and the meadows where we used to gather\r\nbuttercups and tumble in the hay?” And she sat down on a broken chair by\r\nJubilee’s box, and thought of the sweet air of the country, and wiped\r\naway a few slow tears with her apron. At last she got up, and took the\r\nbox in her hands. “He’ll only starve here,” she thought, “and the rats\r\nwill get at him. I’ve a great mind to let him go.” But then she thought\r\nhow vexed the boys would be, and she gave up that idea. If she could\r\nonly sell him they might all be the better for it. She would try and\r\nsell him for sixpence and they would buy a fourpenny loaf, and the boys\r\nshould have a penny each to console them for the loss of their bird. She\r\ntook him down the street in the box, turned down another street, and\r\noffered him at a shop where numbers of birds in cages were hanging in\r\nthe window.\r\n\r\n“Will you give me sixpence for this bird?” she asked. A pang went\r\nthrough Jubilee; to be sold for a sixpence, and he a royal bird!\r\n\r\nThe shopman, who was in his shirt (and very dirty it was), and had an\r\nevil face, and a short stubbly gray beard, looked with great contempt at\r\nJubilee.\r\n\r\n“Sixpence,” he shouted; “why, it’s only a sparrow!”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” thought Jubilee, “if I could only tell him that I am a Jubilee\r\nsparrow, the only one in London, and worth a thousand times more than my\r\nweight in gold!” He had heard this so often from his father, that he at\r\nlast had come to believe that if ever he really were to be sold they\r\nwould weigh him and multiply the result by a thousand.\r\n\r\n“Sixpence!” cried the shopman. “Sparrows are dear at a penny!”\r\n\r\nThe poor woman was sadly disappointed, and so indeed was Jubilee. She\r\noffered to sell the box as well, and after some bargaining, Jubilee and\r\nhis box were handed over to the man for the sum of threepence, on which\r\nthe starving family dined that day, and were thankful too.\r\n\r\nJubilee had not been long in the shop when the evil-faced man opened the\r\nbox cautiously and seized him before he could escape. Once more his legs\r\nwere tied together, and he was taken into a little dingy back room and\r\nlaid upon a table. Then the man shut the door, lit a gas-lamp, and took\r\nout some paints and washes; and setting a canary in a cage before him,\r\nbegan to paint Jubilee’s feathers to imitate it.\r\n\r\n“What a fat little brute you are,” he said, as he poked his dirty finger\r\ninto the poor bird’s stomach. “But we’ll soon take that down; we’ll\r\nsoon starve you into a nice slim canary. No more fat living for you, you\r\nlittle pig.”\r\n\r\nEvery feather of Jubilee’s wings and tail had to be painted separately,\r\nand washed before it was painted; and the poor worn-out bird had to lie\r\nthere on the table all that day with his legs tied, and was given\r\nnothing to eat. After it was all over he was untied and put in a small\r\ncage, but kept in the same dingy inner room, away from the street. Two\r\ndays later he was taken out again, and the whole process had to be gone\r\nover once more; and all this time he was getting thinner and thinner. It\r\nwas a week after he had been sold, before he was pronounced fit to be\r\ntaken into the shop, and hung in the window in his cage; a label was\r\ntied on to it on which was written--\r\n\r\n                          “Canary, a Bargain.\r\n                     “Warranted Sound. Only 3/6.”\r\n\r\nPoor Jubilee! He was at least worth three and sixpence, and his affairs\r\nwere beginning to go up again. If he could only have the luck to be\r\nbought by one of the royal family, all might be well again. But it was\r\nnot to be. And for a long time nobody even offered to buy him. A fat\r\nbullfinch was sold, and Jubilee was quite glad to get rid of him; he was\r\nso fat, and so proud of his portly red waistcoat. Linnets and\r\nGoldfinches went, and others took their places, and there was always a\r\npretty brisk sale of canaries. But Jubilee was neglected, probably\r\nbecause he used to sit on his perch and mope and ruffle his feathers,\r\nfrom hunger and hatred of the world. He looked sulky, and of course he\r\nnever sang; so the customers would have nothing to say to him. It was a\r\nsad downfall for him, to sit in a cage all day and mope, and have faces\r\nmade at him by street-boys, who loved to flatten their noses against the\r\nwindow and make all sorts of horrible noises and cat-calls, until the\r\nold man ran out with a stick and drove them away. But hunger and\r\nmisfortune had done Jubilee some good, though it had made him very\r\nmiserable. He had lost all his old pride, and had had all the nonsense\r\nknocked out of his head which his foolish father had stored up there.\r\n\r\nOne day he was sitting on his perch, dull and listless as usual, and\r\nterribly annoyed by the shrill singing of three canaries who were in the\r\nwindow with him, and were always making fun of him because he was only a\r\nsham canary and couldn’t sing; when two boys stopped at the window. They\r\nwere of quite a different kind from any who had been there before; they\r\ndid not flatten their noses against the glass, or make horrible noises;\r\nthey wore good clothes, and had broad white collars which were quite\r\nclean, instead of dirty old handkerchiefs. They looked a good deal at\r\nJubilee, and were evidently talking about him; but he could not hear\r\nwhat they said. At last they came into the shop and offered the old man\r\ntwo shillings for him.\r\n\r\n“Make it half-a-crown,” said he, “and you shall have him;” for he was\r\nanxious to get rid of Jubilee. He might begin to moult, or the paint\r\nmight wear off; and then there might be mischief.\r\n\r\nThe boys consented to give half-a-crown, and took Jubilee away with\r\nthem. How glad he was to get out of that shop! Surely better times were\r\ncoming! He was once more in the hands of the aristocracy, and certainly\r\nthey handled him much more gently than the street boys. They carried him\r\nto a big house in Belgravia, put him in an empty cage, and began to\r\nexamine him closely. Then they took him out and turned up his feathers.\r\n\r\n“I thought so,” said one: “I told you so when we were looking at him\r\nthrough the window. That fellow’s a regular old thief. It’s nothing but\r\na common sparrow. Run and ask father to come and see him.”\r\n\r\nThe other boy soon returned with a kind-looking gentleman, who laughed\r\nwhen he saw Jubilee, and told the boys they were lucky to have caught a\r\nwell-known thief and impostor. Then he sent for a cab, took the cage and\r\nthe boys, and drove down to the street where the old man lived, taking\r\nup a policeman on the way. And in another half-hour Jubilee found\r\nhimself at a police-station; he was put in a sunny window, and the paint\r\npartly washed off him, the old man was locked up in a cell, and the\r\ngentleman and the boys were to come next day and give evidence.\r\n\r\nThe next day Jubilee was brought into court in his cage. It was not very\r\npleasant; for he was half yellow and half his natural brown, and all the\r\npeople laughed at him when he was handed up to the magistrate to be\r\nlooked at. But a kind-hearted policeman, who had taken care of him the\r\nevening before, and given him seeds and water, had pity on him, and took\r\nhim out of court as soon as he had been looked at, and washed the paint\r\nquite off him, and put him back in his sunny window. The case was soon\r\nproved, and when the old man had been sent away to prison for obtaining\r\nmoney on false pretences, the policeman asked the boys if he might keep\r\nthe bird, as it was only a sparrow, and his sick wife would be very glad\r\nof it to keep her company while he was out on his beat. The boys gladly\r\nlet him have it, and Jubilee was once more carried off in his cage to a\r\nnew residence.\r\n\r\nThis was a small two-storied house in Pimlico. The policeman carried him\r\nup-stairs to his wife who lay ill in bed.\r\n\r\n“Ah, Harry dear,” said she, “I’m so glad to see you; I’ve been waiting\r\nso long for you. I thought the morning would never come to an end. And\r\nwhat have you got there?”\r\n\r\n“Something to make the time go quicker for you,” said the policeman; and\r\nhe put the cage down on his wife’s bed, and told her the story of the\r\nsparrow.\r\n\r\n“Poor bird,” said she, “poor thing. I can feel for him, as I’m caged up\r\ntoo, and can’t get out into the fresh air. But thank you, Harry, for\r\nthinking of me. He’ll be a companion to me, these long dreary mornings.\r\nBut what shall we call him?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Harry, “I reckon he’s about two months old; and to-day’s\r\nthe 20th of August; so that just about takes us back to Jubilee day. I\r\nthink he must have been born very near about the Jubilee. Let us call\r\nhim Jubilee.”\r\n\r\nAnd Jubilee felt that he was among friends, for now he had his right\r\nname, and was made much of, and was really of some use. And the\r\npoliceman’s uniform was consoling too: for it brought back to his mind\r\nSt. James’s Palace, and the policemen walking up and down the street\r\nbelow, and the scarlet-coated sentinels marching to and fro in front of\r\nthe Prince of Wales’s gates.\r\n\r\nAnd so two or three weeks went by, and Jubilee sat on his perch, and was\r\nfed well with seeds, and wished he could have sung like the canaries to\r\nshow his gratitude and make the time pass quicker for the suffering\r\nwife. She grew paler and paler, and wearier and wearier, and seemed to\r\ntake pleasure in nothing but Jubilee, and in looking for the time when\r\nher husband should come home. She would take the bird out of his cage,\r\nand he would hop about on the bed, and take seeds and crumbs out of her\r\nhand. He did not want to escape, and meet with new perils and\r\nadventures. Never had Jubilee been so happy before.\r\n\r\nOne day the doctor came, and told her husband that if his wife was ever\r\nto get well, she must go into the country for fresh air. It was hard on\r\nHarry, for he could not go with her; he must stay in London, and earn\r\nhis living. But he took his savings out of the bank, and with these he\r\ncontrived to get his wife taken to Victoria station, and thence in the\r\ntrain to the Sussex village where her parents lived. And of course\r\nJubilee went with her.\r\n\r\nI cannot stop to tell the wonders of that journey for Jubilee, or the\r\ndelight of getting into pure fresh breezes among the Sussex downs. He\r\nwas put into a window in an old red-brick cottage, where he soon learnt\r\nto forget all about London, and the pride of his early days, and all the\r\nhorrors he had gone through. And, in spite of his being only a sparrow,\r\nand having never a song to sing, he was able to soothe the sick wife’s\r\nweary hours, and perhaps loved her as dearly as she loved him.\r\n\r\nBut she got no better; and one day the doctor said that a telegram must\r\nbe sent at once to fetch her husband from London. When he came in the\r\nafternoon, she was lying unconscious, with Jubilee on a chair beside the\r\nbed. Jubilee did not know what followed; but before it was dark the\r\npoliceman had taken his cage to the window and opened the door, saying\r\nin a voice that trembled as the bird had never heard it tremble\r\nbefore--\r\n\r\n“We shall not want you any more, little Jubilee; go your way, and take\r\nour thanks with you.”\r\n\r\nJubilee flew out of the cage into the free air. What has since become of\r\nhim I cannot tell you. But we may be sure that he did not go back to the\r\nperils of London streets, or to the pride and glory of a royal palace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FALCON’S NEST.\r\n\r\n\r\nUp the little street of thatched fishermen’s cottages, that ran inland\r\nfrom the stony beach and then curved away under the swelling down, there\r\nhurried early one May morning a dark-eyed girl, with a wounded pigeon in\r\nher hand. The wings of the bird were fluttering, as if it were in pain;\r\na feather dropped here and there upon the road, and there was blood at\r\nits beak. The girl pressed it to her cheek in loving pity, and her loose\r\ndark brown hair fell over it, as the morning breeze followed her from\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nShe stopped at a cottage gate, half way up the street, unlatched it with\r\nher free hand, passed through the little garden, and ran into the\r\ncottage without knocking. No one was in the little room.\r\n\r\n“Harold!” she cried. “Harold! where are you?”\r\n\r\nA boy of fifteen, tall and lithe, bonny-looking, and fair-haired, came\r\nin through the back door. He wore a blue jersey, and seemed made for a\r\nseafaring life.\r\n\r\n“Why, Molly, it’s not seven o’clock, and we haven’t had breakfast yet. I\r\nthought you girls were in bed at this time of day. Hallo! What’s the\r\nmatter with the pigeon?”\r\n\r\nHe took the bird out of her hand, for Molly, in spite of her fourteen\r\nyears, had begun to cry, and could not answer his question. He turned\r\nthe bird over gently and smoothed its feathers. Then he fell to stroking\r\nMolly’s hair.\r\n\r\n“Poor old Molly,” he said soothingly. “Don’t cry. Was it the cat?”\r\n\r\nMolly sat down, took the pigeon back from him, and dried her eyes on its\r\nsilky plumage.\r\n\r\n“No,” she said, still choking a little, “it wasn’t the cat, it was a\r\nterrible great bird. Why should he have come at _my_ pigeon, that _you_\r\ngave me, when there were so many others for him? I saw him, as I was\r\ndressing, come right down, and just as he was seizing poor Snowdrop I\r\nthrew my shoe at him and frightened him, and then he let go Snowdrop,\r\nand made a swoop into Mrs. Timms’s garden, and carried off another\r\npigeon instead. Oh, the horrible, cruel creature!”\r\n\r\nHarold gave a long whistle. “It’s the falcon,” he said, “from the red\r\ncliffs. I know him, the cruel brute! He’s got his nest there, Molly, and\r\nhe’s feeding young ones. That’s why it is he comes here now. Never you\r\nmind, Molly,” he added, as he saw the pigeon was dead, “I’ll give you\r\nanother, and what’s more, I’ll have those young falcons to make all\r\nsafe.”\r\n\r\nMolly looked at him with her usual admiring gaze. Harold and she had\r\nbeen playmates since they were small children and lived as next door\r\nneighbours, and though they did not see quite so much of each other now\r\nthat Harold’s father was dead, and his mother had come to live in a\r\nsmaller cottage further up the street, they were still as fond of each\r\nother as ever. Molly had long ago given up her whole soul to Harold: she\r\nhad no secret from him. He had been a brother to her all her life, and\r\neven more than a brother. Perhaps if she had had any brothers they\r\nwould have either despised her and kept her down, or they would have\r\nspoilt her, but Harold did neither. He was her sun, cheering and warming\r\nher; as to being obliged to do without him, that was a thing she had\r\nnever thought of.\r\n\r\nBut some little time before the appearance of the falcon Harold had\r\nsuddenly taken it into his head that he must go into the royal navy. A\r\ncoast-guard friend of his had for some time been trying to persuade him\r\nto join a training-ship, but Harold had steadily refused, thinking that\r\na fisherman’s free life was the happiest in the world. But as he grew\r\nolder he began to discover that the fisherman’s freedom was bought at a\r\nhigh price. They had to sell their fish for very little, and other\r\npeople made the money they ought to have had. And for a great part of\r\nthe year very little was done in the way of fishing, except lobster-and\r\ncrab-catching, and lobsters and crabs were getting scarcer than they\r\nused to be. There were in fact too many fishermen, and they were\r\ngradually catching all the crabs and lobsters on the coast. And so\r\nHarold at last came to the conclusion that if he was to support his\r\nmother in her old age he should set himself to some work which would\r\nmake him sure of a fixed income, and if possible a rising one.\r\n\r\nWhen Molly learnt that her Harold was actually going to leave her, and\r\nthat in a few days she would see the last of him for a long time to\r\ncome, her whole life seemed to be going to change. It was as if her boat\r\nhad suddenly sprung a leak, and was sinking away from beneath her. The\r\nvillage, the bay, the beach, the lanes, could never be the same without\r\nHarold. She had been used to lean on him, to rest her whole being\r\nagainst his; and she did not know that even boys and girls, like men and\r\nwomen, must lose the props they make for themselves, and yet contrive\r\nsomehow to stand without their help. Seeing her sorrowful eyes, and\r\nwishing to see them bright again, rather than feeling with her in her\r\npain, he had given her the pigeon; and now the cruel falcon’s talons had\r\ntorn her sensitive little heart almost as ruthlessly as the bird’s\r\ntender breast.\r\n\r\nHarold came out of the cottage door and looked at the weather. It was a\r\nstill spring morning with a silky mist lying about the hills, which\r\nwould clear away if the slightest breeze got up.\r\n\r\n“I’ll go to-day, Molly,” he said, “and you shall come with me if you\r\nlike. We’ll have one jolly day together before I go to the\r\ntraining-ship. The tide runs eastward up till twelve, and will bring us\r\nback easily in the afternoon. Come down to the beach in half an hour:\r\nI’ll have the boat ready, and some bread and cheese. You ask your mother\r\nfor some cold tea.” And Harold, delighted with his plan, and with his\r\nmind as cloudless as a sunny summer’s day, ran off to get his boat\r\nready, hardly finding time to give Molly the kiss that her uplifted\r\ngrateful face demanded of him.\r\n\r\nIn half an hour she and the boat were both ready, and they passed out of\r\nthe little bay, she steering and he rowing, as the mist began to lift\r\nfrom the curving outlines of the downs. It was very restful to Molly to\r\nglide over that silky sea, with the gulls quietly sailing above, the\r\nbreeze from the land just breathing on her, and Harold’s bright face\r\nopposite to her; and for a while she was perfectly happy, thinking of\r\nnothing. But suddenly the sound of a big gun reached them, and looking\r\nout to sea they saw the distant masts of a huge ironclad, and a white\r\ncurl of smoke, which had already risen high in air by the time the sound\r\nreached them. As they looked, another white puff, and, as it slowly\r\nrose, another faint boom. Harold’s eyes sparkled, and he rested on his\r\noars, and turned to watch the ship.\r\n\r\n“I expect it’s the _Monarch_,” he said. “I know she’s cruising about\r\nhere. Just think, Molly! Some day perhaps you’ll hear the big guns and I\r\nshall be on board. And thinking of you,” he added, as his face came\r\nround to look at Molly with a look half of pity, half of pride. But\r\nthere was a big tear slowly slipping down Molly’s brown cheek. The\r\nthought of Harold’s going had come over her like a cloud, and the rain\r\nwas beginning to fall. For a moment he felt angry; plunged the oars\r\ninto the water, and rowed on strongly with just a faint flush on his\r\ncheek. Then seeing her face turned away, so that he should not see the\r\ntear, and the little mouth compressed and chin held firm so as to keep\r\nanother from escaping, he shipped his oars, jumped across to her, and\r\nwith boyish energy gave her a host of rough kisses on each cheek. Then\r\nhe took her face between his hands and said--\r\n\r\n“Molly, don’t you be silly. If you’re going to cry every time you hear a\r\nbig gun fired I’ll sail right away to the other side of the world and\r\nmarry some one over there. But if you’ll be a good girl I’ll come back\r\nsome day and be a coastguard, and then we can live in one of those\r\ncottages by the flagstaff, and you shall polish the windows and the\r\nfloors till they shine like mother’s china. And when I get to Portsmouth\r\nI’ll have a likeness taken in uniform, and you shall have it to hang up\r\nin your own room. Now then, let go, silly, or we shall be on the rocks!”\r\n\r\nHe disengaged himself from the fervid embrace in which Molly had caught\r\nhim, and was back in his seat, pulling hard into the current of the\r\ntide again, which was now carrying them fast along the foot of the\r\ncliffs. They rounded one little headland, and then another, and\r\npresently found themselves under a deep curve of the cliffs, here some\r\nthree or four hundred feet high, quite inaccessible from above, where\r\nthe rocks were almost perpendicular, but broken somewhat at the base by\r\nthe action of the sea. These cliffs--the red cliffs as they were called\r\nfrom their colour--were the favourite breeding place of many birds, and\r\nthey were dotted all over, as the boat rounded the headland, with\r\nkittiwakes, guillemots, razorbills, and other sea-birds, who sailed up\r\ninto the air, or far away to sea, with loud cries, as the intruders came\r\nnearer. Harold paid them little attention, but made straight across the\r\ncurve towards the opposite headland, where the cliff seemed almost to\r\nbeetle over, and where the shadow, as they had been rowing eastwards and\r\nit was still morning, lay heavy and black over the water. Here, he knew,\r\nthe peregrine falcon built its nest nearly every year: for the nest\r\ncould only be reached from the sea, and no hardy climber had as yet\r\nattempted to get at it by that way. Once the male bird had been shot,\r\nand for two or three years no nest had been built; but another pair had\r\nfound the place out, and this year had been so far lucky enough to\r\nescape the guns of collectors and gamekeepers.\r\n\r\nHarold put in to the shore, and moored the boat to a stone. No falcon\r\nwas in sight. He told Molly to lie down in the boat quite still; and\r\nstretching himself beside her on his back, he fed her with bread and\r\ncheese, keeping a sharp lookout all the while. For a long time they lay\r\nthere, and it was a happy time for both of them. The gentle sigh of the\r\nwaves daintily lapping the stones, and the call of the sea-birds\r\noverhead, were all the sounds they heard, except the occasional distant\r\nboom of a gun, which still sent a little pang through Molly’s tender\r\nheart. But she thought of the coastguard’s cottage, and all the time\r\nthat was to be passed before she could be polishing its floors and\r\nwindows for Harold melted away before that vision of happiness, which\r\nstood out like a distant peak when all the nearer hills and vales are\r\nhidden in a morning mist.\r\n\r\nSo they lay there in the boat, waiting for the falcon to appear, for it\r\nwas hopeless to try and discover the nest until one of the old birds\r\nshould return to it with food for the young. Every now and then Molly’s\r\nrosy mouth opened to receive a bit of bread and cheese, offered it on\r\nthe point of Harold’s clasp-knife, which his coastguard friend had given\r\nhim; but at last there was no more, and lulled by the gentle motion of\r\nthe boat, she fell into a peaceful doze. She awoke, feeling Harold’s\r\nhand on her mouth.\r\n\r\n“Don’t speak, Molly,” he whispered; “look there! That’s the wicked thing\r\nthat killed your Snowdrop.”\r\n\r\nShe looked up and saw a large bird hovering just at the edge of the\r\ncliffs above them. Its great wings were spread out, as it sailed round\r\nand round for a while, looking to see that the coast was clear: and\r\ntheir sharp eyes could see that it carried something in its talons.\r\nThen, seeing nothing to disturb its solitude, it wheeled slowly down the\r\ncliff, and perched on a projecting bit of rock, not very high above\r\ntheir heads, and stood there, proud and fierce, with one foot still\r\ngrasping its victim, which they could now see was a young leveret,\r\nbleeding and struggling in its last agony. When the last struggle was\r\nover, and not before, the sharp, cruel, beak was driven like a knife\r\ninto the leveret’s neck, and the fur torn from its back; and when the\r\nbutcher’s work was complete, the great bird slowly rose on its wings,\r\nand sailed into the air once more with the bleeding victim.\r\n\r\nHarold slowly changed his position in the boat, and watched the falcon\r\nclosely and silently. Wheeling once or twice, as it rose against the\r\ncliff, and uttering a chattering cry as if to announce its coming to its\r\nyoung ones, it passed within a narrow cleft in the rock, about a third\r\nof the way down the precipice, and disappeared. The boy was on his feet\r\nin an instant, and, springing out of the boat, he took off his blue\r\njersey, and threw it to Molly to take care of; then he took a long look\r\nat the rocks above him, and rapidly made up his mind as to the line he\r\nwould take in climbing. The first part was easy enough; but at the\r\nheight of about a hundred feet from the sea the rocks suddenly became\r\nsteeper. Still there was nothing to prevent an active lad from scaling\r\nthem, if the hold for hand and foot were only firm; but the red rock was\r\nsometimes loose and brittle, and would need great care in handling. If\r\nhe could pass safely along the face of these higher rocks by a little\r\nledge which gave room for a few rock-loving plants to grow, he would\r\nreach the cleft into which the falcon had disappeared; once there, he\r\nmust trust to luck, for he could not see further from below.\r\n\r\nHe quickly passed up the lower and more broken part of the cliff, Molly\r\nwatching the easy motion of his supple form with pride and confidence.\r\nNo shade of anxiety for him crossed her mind; she had often seen him\r\nclimb both rocks and trees before, and had even sometimes climbed with\r\nhim. She too was strong and active, and knew the delight of swinging\r\nherself from rock to rock or from bough to bough, with the perfect\r\nconfidence that young heads place in the resources of their hands and\r\nfeet. She would have been quite willing to dare even these cliffs with\r\nhim, if he had asked her; but Harold knew very well that this would be\r\nthe roughest climb he had ever yet tried, and had all the morning spoken\r\nas if he were going alone; so Molly quietly acquiesced, as she always\r\ndid on such occasions. She sat in the boat, her hands playing with her\r\nblue worsted cap, but her eyes intently fixed on the climber.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the steeper rocks, he went more slowly; and she could\r\nsee him testing the firmness of his foothold by a kick, or loosening a\r\nstone with his hand, which went leaping downwards and fell into the sea\r\nwith a splash, almost too near the boat to be pleasant. Once or twice he\r\npicked up the egg of some Guillemot or Gull which had flown off as he\r\napproached, and held it out for Molly to see; and once he stopped to\r\nexamine the skin of the leveret which the falcon had left behind on the\r\nprojecting bit of rock. At last he safely reached the ledge, and began\r\nto walk carefully along it, steadying himself against the rock above him\r\nwith his right hand. Just before he reached the cleft to which the ledge\r\nwas leading him, Molly saw the falcon sail out of it again within a few\r\nyards of him; but Harold stood perfectly motionless in the shadow of the\r\nrock, and the magnificent bird, too busy to search for intruders, failed\r\nto see him, and rising slowly, passed over the beetling brow of the\r\ncliff and disappeared inland.\r\n\r\nThen he went on again slowly, to the corner where the ledge passed into\r\nthe cleft and out of Molly’s sight: and now she first began to wonder\r\nwhether he would after all be able to reach the nest. The corner\r\nprojected sharply, and in rounding it, the ledge seemed almost to come\r\nto an end; no grass grew on it at that point, and the rocks above and\r\nbelow were cut sharply and steeply. She saw him stop for a minute or two\r\nwhen he came to this corner, and put his foot forward to try the\r\nfooting; her blue cap dropped out of her hands into the boat, and she\r\nsat up gazing with eager eyes and parted lips. Then she saw him rest his\r\nleft foot on the jutting bit of rock he had tested, kneel down on his\r\nright knee, and slowly work himself along with the help of his hands. As\r\nhe turned the corner, he seemed to get into easier quarters, for he\r\nrose to his feet again, and passed in a moment out of her sight into the\r\ndark cleft.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later she heard the cries of the young falcons, and a loud\r\nshout from Harold told her that vengeance was being done for Snowdrop’s\r\ndeath. Sticks and rubbish began to fall down the rocks; he was razing to\r\nthe ground the falcon’s rockbuilt refuge. And then he emerged again,\r\nwith a young bird in his hand, which he proceeded to tie up in his\r\npocket-handkerchief, and button inside the breast of his shirt. When all\r\nwas ready, he again knelt down, this time with his left knee, using his\r\nright foot to support him below wherever it could find a firm support.\r\nMolly watched her hero now impatiently; she wanted him to come down\r\nquickly and show her the young falcon.\r\n\r\nThe difficult part was almost over, when some bit of stone on which he\r\nhad rested his right foot gave away, and rolled down the precipice. He\r\nhad nothing now to hold by except his left knee, and Molly, now standing\r\nup in the boat in real anxiety, saw him keeping his balance with\r\ndifficulty by pressing his unsupported leg hard against the rocks. Then\r\nshe saw him make a spring--such a spring indeed as one can make with\r\nnothing to spring from but one’s left knee--and try to catch at a big\r\nred knob which lay just at the end of the perilous part of the ledge.\r\nHis hands caught the knob, and he turned with his face to the rock\r\nstruggling to bring his feet up once more to the level of the ledge. But\r\nthe stone was treacherous and gave way, and the boy, after another\r\nmoment’s effort to save himself, fell after it down the steeper part of\r\nthe rocks, till he was caught by another ledge below, and there lay\r\nquite still.\r\n\r\nMolly uttered an inarticulate sound as she saw him fall; she did not cry\r\nor scream, but she trembled all over. A cold feeling went down her back,\r\nand her heart beat so violently that for a moment she was obliged to sit\r\ndown panting. She looked all round to see if any boat was in sight, but\r\nthe fishermen did not often come so far at that time of the year, and\r\nthe sea was unbroken by an oar. Only far out in the offing lay the huge\r\nform of the ironclad; and for an instant there flashed through Molly’s\r\nmind the picture of Harold in his young strength sitting opposite her\r\nwith his oars, turning to watch the firing of the big guns, then holding\r\nher face in his hands, and bidding her not be silly. Something told her\r\nthat now an effort was needed from her, such as she had never had to\r\nmake in her life before; and, strong and healthy as she was, she felt\r\nher faintness passing, and her will growing strong. She was quite alone;\r\nshe must act; what should she do?\r\n\r\nAt first she thought of rowing back for help, but she knew that the tide\r\nhad not yet turned, and that she would be a much longer time getting\r\nback than they had taken in coming. And then she would have to leave\r\nHarold all that time, and he perhaps dying, or at least badly hurt. He\r\nmight indeed be dead; but at none of these possibilities did she quail\r\nagain, now that she had fully nerved herself for action. She must climb\r\nand reach him; and she set about it instantly. With a woman’s instinct\r\nshe took what was left of the cold tea that they had brought with them,\r\ntied Harold’s blue jersey round her neck by the sleeves, stepped firmly\r\nout of the boat, and after marking the spot where he fell, began to\r\nclimb.\r\n\r\nOnce at the top of the easier rocks, she found herself not far below the\r\nshelf upon which he must be lying, and called to him. No answer came.\r\nPanting with effort and excitement, but with firm limbs and steady head,\r\nshe began to ascend the steeper rocks, and presently reached what seemed\r\nto be a faint track, made perhaps by some animal, which led her easily\r\nupwards to the shelf. When she reached it her strength failed for a\r\nmoment, and her eyes seemed dim; but mastering herself again she\r\nadvanced, and suddenly came upon Harold, lying on his back in a little\r\nbed of rough grass and samphire. She saw in an instant that he was\r\nalive, and spoke to him, but he did not answer. Then she knelt down\r\nbeside him, folded up the jersey and put it under his head; opened the\r\nbottle of cold tea, and moistening her fingers with it, rubbed his\r\ntemples and wetted his nostrils. She gave his forehead one kiss; but\r\nthere was work to be done, and this was no time for kisses: she felt\r\nhalf ashamed even of this one. She searched for wounds, but could find\r\nnone; only she feared that one arm on which he was lying must be badly\r\nhurt. But she could not move him, and must wait till he came to himself;\r\nand she went on rubbing and chafing, yet sparing the tea till he should\r\nwake and be able to drink some. It was quite an hour before he came to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nAt last his eyes opened slowly, and his lips moved a little, but without\r\na sound. She held the bottle to them, and he swallowed a little of the\r\ntea; then the eyes closed again, and he seemed to sleep. Presently she\r\nsaw a fisherman’s boat passing at some distance from the shore. She\r\nstood up, waved her handkerchief and shouted; but the boat was too far\r\noff, and she was neither heard nor seen.\r\n\r\nHer shouting woke Harold again, and in a faint voice he said, “What’s\r\nthe matter, Molly?” and then, after a pause, “Where’s the young\r\nfalcon?”\r\n\r\nShe looked in his shirt; the handkerchief was still there, and the young\r\nbird was in it, though dead. “Here it is, Harold,” she said; “and now\r\nyou must try and get up and come down with me to the boat, and I’ll row\r\nyou home and take care of you till you’re all right again.”\r\n\r\n“Dear old Molly,” was all that Harold answered; but they were words that\r\nMolly never forgot.\r\n\r\nHe tried to get up, but the pain in his arm was so great that he fainted\r\naway again; and Molly had to sit, now silent and sad, and watch for some\r\nboat coming round the headland, chafing his temples from time to time\r\nwith fingers as gentle as a lady’s. When he came to himself once more,\r\nit was getting towards evening; the sea was cold and gray, and the mist\r\nbegan to creep again around the cliffs. Molly had been thinking of what\r\nwas to be done; her mind seemed stronger and clearer than it had ever\r\nbeen before, and she spoke to Harold firmly, like a mother talking to\r\nher little boy.\r\n\r\n“Harold dear, I must leave you and go and get help; you will die of cold\r\nif we have to stay out all night. But first I must make you as\r\ncomfortable as I can. Which pocket is your knife in?”\r\n\r\nHe told her, and she succeeded in getting it out without hurting him.\r\nThen she took the jersey from under his head, cut off the sleeve that\r\nbelonged to the injured arm, and contrived to slip the warm garment over\r\nhis body and right arm; took off her own jersey, and laid it under his\r\nhead, gave him a kiss and stroked his fair hair, and told him to lie\r\nstill and go to sleep, and she would be back soon. And then she started\r\ndown the rocks, marking her way carefully that she might recollect it\r\nwhen she returned, and stepping into the boat, pulled westwards as fast\r\nas she could. The sun was setting when she reached the village.\r\n\r\nHer news spread like wildfire. Her father borrowed a horse, and rode off\r\nto the nearest town for a doctor; her mother put on her bonnet and went\r\nto break the news to Harold’s mother. By the time Molly, still steady of\r\npurpose though stiff and tired, had eaten such a meal as she could get\r\ndown, and put up some more provisions and some brandy for Harold, four\r\nstalwart fishermen were ready with a big boat and lanterns, and were\r\nwaiting for her on the beach. Tired as she was, Molly would have liked\r\nto have taken an oar, and even asked to be allowed to do so. She could\r\nnot bear to be doing nothing; she was in a state of restless activity\r\nand energy. One of the men laughed, and bade her lie down in the boat\r\nand go to sleep. But an older man, who saw her dark eyes sparkling in\r\nthe moonlight with a strange wildness, did Molly a good turn.\r\n\r\n“Give her the tiller, Dick,” he said: “don’t you see the lass must be at\r\nsomething? Come, Molly, lass, steer us straight, and tell us all about\r\nyou and the lad.”\r\n\r\nSo Molly took the helm, and went over the story with them again, and\r\nkind old Martin kept asking her to describe this or that once more and\r\nonce again, and they pulled so strongly and quickly that they were at\r\nthe Red Cliffs long before she expected. Then she asked them to shout,\r\nand held her hands to her ears in hopes of catching an answer from the\r\ncliff, and after the second shout there came a feeble answer.\r\n\r\nShe led the way up the rocks in the moonlight. They found Harold very\r\ncold and in pain; but the brandy soon revived him, and he even contrived\r\nto eat a little.\r\n\r\n“Dear old Molly,” he said once more. And Molly kissed him again, and\r\nstepped downwards with the lantern, to show them the best places for\r\ntheir feet, while they lifted the boy, groaning sadly with pain, laid\r\nhis injured arm over his chest, and began to carry him slowly down the\r\nrocks. She guided them safely down, though the work took a long time,\r\nand was perilous for men who could not use their hands, and terribly\r\npainful for Harold: but it was over at last, and he was laid safely in\r\nthe bottom of the boat, and made as comfortable as possible with the\r\nrugs and pillows which Molly’s mother had provided. Molly sat in the\r\nstern again holding the tiller; but she soon began to droop over it now\r\nthe tension was taken off her, and in a few minutes was fast asleep.\r\nOld Martin took the tiller from her hand, laid her down by Harold, and\r\ncovered her with his own rough pilot-coat. When they reached the\r\nvillage, where the beach was crowded with eager faces, and lanterns were\r\nmoving about here and there, he took her in his arms and carried her to\r\nher mother’s cottage.\r\n\r\n“That’s a rare lass of yours,” he said, “and I never would have thought\r\nit of her. They two must make up together one of these days; and a fine\r\npair they’ll be! Good-night, ma’am.”\r\n\r\nMolly was put to bed, and slept an unbroken sleep till late in the\r\nmorning. When she woke she was so stiff and tired that she could hardly\r\nturn round; but when she did so, she saw the two mothers, her own and\r\nHarold’s, standing by the bedside. The latter kissed her many times on\r\nthe forehead, and told her how Harold had slept well and was now wide\r\nawake, and asking for her; and how he had sent her another pigeon, even\r\nmore beautiful than the last.\r\n\r\n“But, Molly,” she went on, “the doctor says his spine is injured as\r\nwell as his arm, and he won’t be able to go into the Navy. He’s terrible\r\nvexed about it, poor lad.”\r\n\r\nMolly sprang out of bed, in spite of her stiffness. She felt a real and\r\nlively pity for Harold, and she must go to him at once. All her\r\nchildishness was gone; if she could have seen Harold that moment in his\r\nsailor’s dress, marching off to Portsmouth, she would have jumped for\r\njoy. There was work still left for her to do; she must comfort Harold.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe case was more serious than the doctor at first supposed. Harold had\r\nbefore long to be taken away to a London hospital, where he could get\r\nthe benefit of constant attendance and all kinds of appliances. His\r\nmother went with him, and took up her abode in London, in the house of\r\none of Harold’s uncles, who was a small dealer there, and Harold slowly\r\nrecovered his strength, was apprenticed to a carpenter, learnt his trade\r\nwith a good will, and began to make a start in life. It was full four\r\nyears before Harold and Molly met again.\r\n\r\nWhen at last he came to pay a visit to the old fishing-village, he found\r\nMolly a tall, strong and sensible-looking maiden of eighteen. It was she\r\nwho proposed a row to the Red Cliffs, to see the scene of their\r\nadventure four years ago; and it was she who rowed this time, while he\r\nsat in the stern and steered. But it was he who, on their homeward way,\r\njust before they rounded the last headland into the little harbour, let\r\ngo the tiller, took her brown face between his hands, and said once\r\nmore,\r\n\r\n“Dear old Molly!”\r\n\r\nAnd they plighted their loves as the old thatched cottages came in sight\r\nunder the curving embrace of the down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA DEBATE IN AN ORCHARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was one of those midsummer evenings which to the discontented seem\r\nalmost too long. In the orchard the old birds had finished finding the\r\nyoung ones their supper, and the long labours of the day were over. The\r\nswifts were flying, and screaming with delight as they flew, round the\r\nold church tower, and the swallows were gliding less noisily in and out\r\nof the long shadows of the apple-trees; but most of the dwellers in the\r\norchard had taken a quiet perch, and were singing, or dallying in some\r\npleasant way with the last half-hour of daylight, until it should be\r\ntime to go to roost.\r\n\r\nA blackbird, a robin, a sparrow, and a blue titmouse found themselves\r\ntogether on a single tree. They were old acquaintances, for they had\r\nlived together in the orchard and garden the whole winter; friends, in\r\nthe proper sense of the word, they were not, for they differed a good\r\ndeal in their opinions, and had quarrelled nearly every day in the\r\nwinter over the crumbs which had been put for them outside the farmhouse\r\nwindows. But they contrived to put up with one another, and had been so\r\nbusy with their young of late, that all ill-feeling had passed away from\r\ntheir minds.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the sparrow, “here we are again. Upon my word I wish the\r\nsun would set; there’s nothing more to do.”\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you sing?” said the robin.\r\n\r\n“That’s a stale joke,” was the answer. “And your song is getting stale\r\ntoo, Mr. Robin; you’ll have to leave it off a bit soon.”\r\n\r\n“One should not sing too much,” observed the blackbird. “I wonder you\r\nrobins don’t get tired of hearing yourselves. It’s too hot to sing this\r\nevening: spring is the time for that. Let us do something else to amuse\r\nourselves.”\r\n\r\n“Let us see who can hang from a bough best with his head downwards,”\r\nsaid the blue tit; and he instantly performed the feat with great\r\nagility. The sparrow, being in want of something to do, tried to imitate\r\nhim, but he couldn’t do it a bit, and made himself ridiculous.\r\n\r\n“What a lubberly creature!” said a swallow, who had paused in her flight\r\nthrough the orchard to rest for a moment at the end of a dead bough of\r\nthe same tree. “Are you so hard up for something to do? Why don’t you\r\nhave a debate? There was a debate going on in my barn the other evening,\r\nand very amusing it was. Old Squire Wilmot was in the chair. He told the\r\nmen and boys that they were going to have a debate once a month to\r\nsharpen their wits, and--”\r\n\r\n(“That’ll take a long time,” put in the blue tit.)\r\n\r\n“And the young squire was going to propose a motion himself that night.”\r\n\r\n“What do you think it was about? Bird’s-nesting! He said it was cruel, I\r\nbelieve; and some one else said it wasn’t; and there they were\r\nchattering away all the evening. But I had young to attend to, and of\r\ncourse I couldn’t listen, even if it had been worth while. Why don’t you\r\nhave a debate? I dare say you wouldn’t talk quite such nonsense. Good\r\nevening.” And off she went, without waiting for an answer.\r\n\r\n“That’s not a bad idea,” said the blue tit; “only I don’t much care to\r\nimitate Man. What a lumbering animal it is! However, if we are to have a\r\ndebate, why not debate about _him_? We shall all have something to say\r\non that subject, anyhow.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said the Robin, who had a way of taking things into his own\r\nhands, “very well, we will discuss Man. But first we must elect a\r\npresident. I am willing to be president, if you like. Our family has\r\nencouraged Man for many centuries, and we ought to know something about\r\nhim by this time!”\r\n\r\nThere was silence for a minute. The Robin was not so popular in the\r\norchard as to be elected at once by acclamation. At this moment the\r\nSwallow returned to her twig, just to see how they were getting on, and\r\nwas informed of the difficulty.\r\n\r\n“Oh, by all means elect Robin,” said she; “they always elect some\r\nrespectable person president. They like some one who looks better than\r\nhe talks. Presidents don’t make speeches as a rule; they sit and look\r\ngrand, like the beadle in the church where I nested last summer. And now\r\nI think of it,” she added, “that beadle had a red waistcoat just like\r\nBobby’s; so he had.”\r\n\r\nAnd off she went again.\r\n\r\n“Bother that bird,” said the Robin; “she’s like a wild-rose bush, all\r\nprickles and no caterpillars. I won’t be president if I am not to be\r\nallowed to speak. Let the Blackbird preside; it would just suit his\r\ncapacity.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t pretend to be better than I am,” said the Blackbird in his\r\nmellowest tones; “but we had better vote at once, it will soon be dark.\r\nEach of you imitate the voice of the bird you wish to elect. All the\r\nbirds in the orchard shall be welcome and eligible: Starling, Nuthatch,\r\nCreeper, Wren, Flycatcher, Chaffinch. Now then, one, two, three----”\r\n\r\nA variety of strange sounds were heard, so strange and discordant that\r\nthe farmer’s wife looked out at her back-door to see what could be going\r\nforward. But while it was still going on, there was heard at the top of\r\nall the din the clear shrill song of a Wren from a heap of old sticks by\r\nthe wall.\r\n\r\n“The very bird for you,” said the Swallow, alighting once more on her\r\ntwig. “He’ll only have to turn on his loudest song to stop the speakers\r\nif they get tiresome or lose their tempers. He’ll be like the organ in\r\nthat church I was telling you of; it was put there to prevent the\r\nsingers being heard, and it did its business very well. Yes, yes, elect\r\nthe Wren; he’s small, but he’s afraid of no one. And in some countries\r\nthey call him king.”\r\n\r\nShe flew to the heap of sticks, and returned with the Wren, who took his\r\nstation on a prominent bough, cocked his tail very high, and sang his\r\nvery loudest.\r\n\r\n“That will do capitally,” said the Swallow. “Turn on that whenever they\r\nmake fools of themselves, and you’ll have the debate to yourself after\r\nall.”\r\n\r\nAnd she was gone again, leaving them another pleasant little keepsake.\r\nBut they were too eager for the debate to begin, to mind much what she\r\nsaid, and they all consented to accept the Wren as president.\r\n\r\n“I appoint the Blackbird to open the debate,” said the Wren, who had\r\nbeen duly instructed in his duties by the Swallow. “Let the Blackbird\r\nstate what motion he will propose.”\r\n\r\n“I will propose,” replied the Blackbird, “that too close an association\r\nwith Man is degrading to the race of birds.”\r\n\r\n“I won’t speak on that motion,” said the Robin, “I consider it\r\npersonal.”\r\n\r\n“So do I,” said the Sparrow; “grossly personal and insulting.”\r\n\r\n“What’s insulting?” said the Swallow, who was back again for the fourth\r\ntime. “Oh, most insulting to birds who use men’s buildings for their\r\nnests! Look at me and the Sparrows, see how refined and elevated we have\r\nbecome through ages of association with man! One doesn’t like to talk\r\nof one’s self, but I put it to you whether the Sparrow’s charming,\r\nfairy-like grace, dainty appetite, and chastely brilliant colouring, can\r\nwell be ascribed to any other cause? But dear me, I never meant to make\r\na speech. Good-bye; don’t quarrel, and, above all, don’t be sarcastic;\r\nit’s a habit I abhor.” And she glided away once more.\r\n\r\n“That’s one for you, Philip,” said the mischievous Blue-Tit to the\r\nSparrow. “Let her have it back again next time, my dear boy; have a\r\nrepartee ready. Make haste, you have no time to lose.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” said the Sparrow. “Don’t fidget so. I’ll think of my\r\nrepartee during the Blackbird’s speech.”\r\n\r\n“Silence!” called the president. “Trrrrrr-lira-lira-lira-la-trrr! I must\r\ncall on the Blackbird to put his motion in another form, as it is\r\nconsidered personal.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the Blackbird, “I move that Man is an animal as useless as\r\nhe is pernicious. That’ll suit everybody, I hope.”\r\n\r\n“Won’t do,” said the President. “You must\r\n\r\n[Illustration: And the Blackbird began his oration.--P. 117.]\r\n\r\nhave three adjectives, and they must all begin with the same letter. It\r\nalways is so, I assure you; the Swallow told me so just now, and she\r\nheard it all going on in the barn. The young squire proposed that\r\nbird-nesting was mean, mischievous, and malevolent; and a very sensible\r\nmotion too.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said the Blackbird, “then I move that man is a mean,\r\nmischievous, and malevolent animal. Will that do for you?”\r\n\r\n“Excellent!” said every one. “Go on, and be quick.”\r\n\r\n“Be as quick as you can,” said the Robin, “or there won’t be time for my\r\nspeech.”\r\n\r\n“Silence!” cried the president. “I call on the Blackbird.” And the\r\nBlackbird began his oration.\r\n\r\n“Man,” he said, “is in the first place _mean_. This may be thought\r\nperhaps too obvious a proposition to need proof. I need but ask you to\r\nlook over the orchard wall into the kitchen-garden yonder. What do we\r\nsee there? Gooseberry-bushes, currant-bushes, covered with delicious\r\nfruit; I know it, for did I not try the flavour of every one of them\r\ndaily till yesterday? And now, now, just as their juices are mellowing,\r\neach of those trees has been covered over with a most vile and\r\ntreacherous netting! If time were not pressing I could easily produce\r\nstatistics to show----”\r\n\r\n“What are statistics?” asked a Flycatcher deferentially.\r\n\r\n“A new kind of earwigs,” said the Blue-Tit promptly. “Don’t interrupt.\r\nWhat a flow of eloquence!”\r\n\r\n“I could produce statistics to show,” continued the Blackbird, “that\r\nthose gooseberries and currants would be sufficient to feed scores of\r\nblackbirds for several weeks together. Think of what is here lost to the\r\nworld through the meanness of Man!\r\n\r\n“The raspberries indeed are not netted; but, friends, I would ask you,\r\nif you can control your feelings for a moment, to look in the direction\r\nof the raspberry canes. There you may see--I can hardly bear to mention\r\nit--the dead bodies of two cousins of mine, who lost their lives through\r\nthe meanness of Man, in the exercise of their natural rights and\r\nappetites. Shot, cruelly shot, by the farmer’s son, and exposed to view\r\nto frighten us!”\r\n\r\nHere the speaker was overcome by emotion, and paused for a few moments.\r\n\r\n“Go on,” said the Robin, “or you’ll never get to the end of your speech.\r\nWhy do you want to eat fruit? Caterpillars are much better.”\r\n\r\n“Order, order,” cried the President. “Trrrrr-lira-lira-trrr.” The\r\nBlackbird resumed the thread of his argument.\r\n\r\n“I do not care,” he said, “to notice unseemly interruptions at a moment\r\nwhen such painful thoughts have obtruded themselves on my mind. I will\r\nproceed in the next place to show that man is _mischievous_. I need not\r\ndwell on this point; the fact is known to you all. The word is far too\r\nmild. Which of us has not lost a nest, or seen our young caught and\r\nkilled, either by man himself, or by his parasite the cat? They are the\r\nonly two animals who kill for the pleasure of killing. Of the two, as\r\nyou know, man is far the worst; he is more cruel and more awkward than\r\na cat. A cat is agile, nimble, even beautiful to look at, terrible as\r\nshe is; and she does not steal the nests which we have taken such\r\ninfinite pains to build. A kitten is a pretty and even a harmless little\r\ncreature; but the young of man is horrible to contemplate. What dreadful\r\nnoises he makes! What a contemptible object he appears! Though compelled\r\nby nature to keep to the ground and go along on two stumps, he will\r\nsometimes climb trees if he can but see a chance of doing us a mischief.\r\nYou hear the awkward creature crashing through the branches; you are\r\nforced to fly for your life, and to leave your young and eggs to the\r\nmonster’s mercy! I will not harrow your feelings further, but will\r\ncontent myself with the simple assertion that cats are far better.\r\n\r\n“I now come to the third point. Man is _malevolent_. Man, that is (as\r\nsome of you may not understand the word), is evilly disposed towards us.\r\nHis evil deeds are the result of an evil will. I see you are getting\r\nimpatient, so I will only give you a single instance of this, which\r\nshall at the same time be a crushing proof. As I was enjoying myself in\r\na gooseberry bush a day or two ago, before the meanness of man displayed\r\nitself in those malicious nets, I heard the farmer’s wife singing to her\r\nbaby as she sat on the seat under the pear-tree close by me. I kept very\r\nquiet, as you may imagine, and heard all she said. Fancy my horror when\r\nI heard her begin--\r\n\r\n    “Four-and-twenty blackbirds, baked in a pie.”\r\n\r\nThus you see from his earliest years--from the egg, I might have said,\r\nhad Fate destined him for a higher sphere than that he occupies--is Man\r\ntaught malevolence towards the birds. His mother whispers the poison\r\neven into his baby ears; he grows up thinking of baked blackbirds; and\r\nthough no doubt in later life he prefers what he (luckily for us) calls\r\nbigger game, the malevolence of his mind towards us singing-birds is\r\never on the increase. Such then is Man: mean, mischievous, malevolent; a\r\ncreature that might indeed, in many ways be our equal if he could but\r\nrestrain his evil instincts; but as he is, degraded, demoralized, and\r\ndangerous.”\r\n\r\nThis burst of eloquence took the company by surprise; they never\r\nsuspected the Blackbird of possessing such genius. There was general\r\napplause, which was broken in upon however by an unlucky incident. The\r\nRobin, when the Blackbird stopped, had instantly taken possession of the\r\norator’s bough, a prominent one directly below that of the president.\r\nThe Sparrow, seeing this, and being always ready to pick a quarrel with\r\nthe Robin, had flown to the bough with angry screams, and was trying to\r\nturn out the new orator. Robin fought as might be expected of him, the\r\nother birds were preparing to join in, the President was calling for\r\norder, and whistling his very shrillest, when up came the Swallow once\r\nmore. She preferred to be absent during the speeches, but looked in, she\r\nsaid, to see if their wits were getting sharpened.\r\n\r\n“What!” she exclaimed, “quarrelling already! Ah, I see, no wits to\r\nsharpen, so try claws and beaks instead!”\r\n\r\n“Where’s your repartee, Philip?” said the Blue Tit. But before the\r\nrepartee was forthcoming the Swallow was gone again.\r\n\r\nThe Swallow’s remark had the result of calming the troubled waters; and\r\nas the Robin had been first on the bough, the President called on him to\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n“I do not pretend to eloquence,” said the Robin; “but I know what I\r\nthink, and shall say it as well as I can. Some things the Blackbird has\r\nsaid I agree with; but birds who habitually eat fruit must expect man to\r\nmake war upon them. Now between my family and man there has been for\r\nages a treaty of peace--a treaty which man keeps up, because he knows\r\nhow much it is to his advantage; and which we keep up, not only for our\r\nown benefit, but because we hope that in due time we may improve and\r\nelevate man. He is powerful, but he is by nature vicious, as the\r\nBlackbird has observed. Well, we hope we have done something in the\r\npast, and may do something in the future, to rid him of his baser\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\n“You probably do not know how this treaty of peace came to be made. I\r\nwill tell you as shortly as I can. Long ages ago there was a king of\r\nthis island who married and had two lovely children, a boy and a girl.\r\nThese children went out one day to play in the wood near their papa’s\r\npalace, and lost their way. Night came on, and they lay down to sleep;\r\nthey never woke up again, but lay there dead and cold. _We_ saw them\r\nthere; _we_ covered them with leaves, and paid a last tribute to their\r\nbeauty and innocence. The king and queen found us at the good work, and\r\nthen and there made a treaty with us, which has lasted in this island\r\never since. By this treaty it was ordained--\r\n\r\n“1. That man should not use his strength or his dreadful engines of\r\ndestruction to kill or molest any robin.\r\n\r\n“2. That man should abstain from taking the nest of any robin; but that\r\nhe should be allowed to take one egg now and then, if he should feel his\r\nevil desire for collecting getting the better of him.\r\n\r\n“3. That man should put food outside his windows for the robins in the\r\nwinter, and should take care that it was not all eaten up by sparrows.”\r\n\r\n(Here the Sparrow asked the President whether the speaker was in order\r\nin introducing such offensive matter into his speech. The President\r\ndecided that as the Robin was quoting a historical document, no offence\r\ncould be taken.)\r\n\r\n“These,” said the Robin, “are the most important clauses of the treaty.\r\nOn our side it was agreed:\r\n\r\n“First, that the robins should abstain as far as possible from damaging\r\nman’s property, _i.e._ his fruit or his corn, and should do him as much\r\ngood as possible by eating the grubs and caterpillars in his gardens.\r\n\r\n“This clause has been faithfully kept by us, to our own lasting benefit\r\nas well as that of man. I would advise all birds who insist on eating\r\nfruit and corn to observe how excellent are the results of a grub and\r\ncaterpillar diet.” Here the Robin paused a moment, and displayed his\r\nportly red waistcoat in all its glory to the audience. Then he went\r\non:--\r\n\r\n“Secondly, it was agreed that the robins should take up their dwelling\r\nas far as possible in the haunts and gardens of man, and should sing to\r\nhim, not only in the spring or the summer, but all the year round, as\r\noften as they should feel able and disposed to do so. This clause has\r\nalso been faithfully kept by us, and the result is, in my humble\r\nopinion, that we are now not only the most regular, but the most\r\nversatile and accomplished singers who affect the haunts of man. I will\r\nnot however press that point, as I see some of you seem to dissent.\r\n\r\n“Now you will observe that though, as was right and proper, this treaty\r\nwas framed much to the advantage of the robins, both parties to it have\r\ncertainly gained by it, and man, who has on the whole kept it fairly\r\nwell, has learnt from it to respect and to care for at least one family\r\nof birds. I would therefore conclude by asking you to consider, before\r\nyou pass this motion, and commit yourselves to perpetual enmity to\r\nmankind, whether it would not be wiser to follow our example, and make a\r\nlasting peace with him. I am convinced that you would do yourselves no\r\nharm; and I am still more firmly convinced that you would find a\r\npleasure in joining us in the good work of raising mankind to a higher\r\nlevel of life, and a better appreciation of the superior creatures\r\naround him.”\r\n\r\nThere was but faint applause when the Robin left the orator’s bough. He\r\nwas not popular, as has been remarked; and he was always posing (so they\r\nthought) as a superior person. And now he claimed superior wisdom on the\r\nground of his intimacy with man! The Sparrow, who had listened very\r\nimpatiently to his speech, sprang up at once to the bough, and began in\r\nloud and rather angry tones:--\r\n\r\n“What rubbish people can talk! The motion itself is absurd, the\r\nBlackbird’s speech was silly, and the Robin’s speech shows that his\r\nwhole race, from the beginning, have, as I always said, been the victims\r\nof a delusion. You none of you know the least bit how to deal with man.\r\nWe Sparrows found out the secret ages ago, and look how we have\r\nprospered! Talk of treaties! why in the name of all that’s feathered\r\nshould any one want to make a treaty with man? I say it’s ridiculous.\r\nThat isn’t the way to do it. Only idiots would do that.”\r\n\r\n“Order, order!” said the President. “I really must call on the\r\nhonourable speaker to control his feelings and modify his expressions.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said the Sparrow; “but really when one hears such\r\nblathering nonsense talked--”\r\n\r\n“Order, order!” called the President, and whistled his loudest. “The\r\nhonourable Sparrow must positively address himself to the point, and not\r\nbe rude, or I shall call on him to retire.” Thus admonished, the Sparrow\r\ncontinued in milder tones:--\r\n\r\n“Well really, you know, what I was going to say was, when the President\r\ninterrupted me, that man is here to be made use of, not to be made\r\ntreaties with. We found out long ago how to make use of him, just as we\r\nfound out long ago how to use the martins’ nests. (Loud cries of\r\n‘shame.’) Shame, indeed! Rubbish! If you want to prosper, take what you\r\ncan get, and don’t go to make treaties about it, or fight for it more\r\nthan you can help; lay your claws into it when no one’s looking, and\r\nmake sure of it. You’ll be the better, and no one else the wiser. Man\r\nsows corn: we take it; thousands of us live on it nearly all the year\r\nround. Man sows peas: we take them--at least all the juicy young\r\nones--he can have the old ones for himself. Man plants crocuses: we\r\nfound out that there was good food inside the blossoms, and we take\r\nthem. Man puts bread-crumbs outside his window, in fulfilment of his\r\ntreaty with the robins, no doubt: we take it nearly all. Man does no end\r\nof other things, and we take advantage of them all. And see how it pays!\r\nWe sparrows are the rising race. We increase every year by thousands; we\r\ngo everywhere; we despise nothing; we eat anything; and we have a good\r\ntime of it. All you other birds will disappear in time; there’ll be no\r\nroom for you, and nothing left for you to eat. Man will remain, but only\r\nto support us; we must have peas and corn, so man must remain. And may\r\nhe ever remain,” added the orator, in a burst of eloquence, “the\r\ninfatuated slave that he is now!”\r\n\r\n“Bravo!” said the twittering voice of the Swallow, who had returned\r\nagain, attracted by the Sparrow’s loud tones. “Capital! and how pleasing\r\nto think that there’s one animal in the world who’s a greater blockhead\r\nthan a Sparrow!”\r\n\r\n“Now then, Philip,” said the Blue Tit, “here’s your chance; where’s that\r\nrepartee?”\r\n\r\nThe Sparrow ruffled his feathers, and pecked at them, as if half\r\nexpecting to find the repartee there; but not succeeding, he was just\r\nabout to fly at the Swallow and drive her from her perch, when lo! a\r\nlittle maiden of seven years old came running and dancing into the\r\norchard, and made for the very tree on which the birds were perching.\r\nThe Blackbird went off instantly with a loud cackle; the Sparrow\r\nchattered excitedly and went off too; the Robin departed very quietly to\r\nanother part of the orchard; and the Starling, Chaffinch, and others\r\nmade off as fast as they could go. Only the Swallow and the Wren were\r\nleft; neither of them were a bit frightened.\r\n\r\n“Now by the salt wave of the Mediterranean, which I have so often\r\ncrossed,” said the Swallow, “I am glad we were spared that repartee.”\r\n\r\n“Now by the sweet juices of a green caterpillar, which I have so often\r\nsucked,” said the Wren, “I am glad we have come to the end of this\r\nfolly. Good-night; the sun has set. There’s a bat; I really must get\r\nhome.”\r\n\r\nThe Swallow was left alone. “Well,” said she to herself, “once is\r\nenough; I’ll not ask them to have another debate. I’m glad I didn’t hear\r\nthe speeches. We swallows trust in man, and he loves us; but we cannot\r\nunderstand him, nor he us. But we live all our lives by love and trust,”\r\nsaid she, as she opened her wings to fly; “as for understanding, that\r\nmust wait.”\r\n\r\nShe was gone, and the orchard was silent again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TRAGEDY IN ROOK-LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a fine day early in February, and the rooks, after roosting on\r\nthe elm-trees in the village, and surveying the remnants of the nests of\r\nlast year, were assembled, some on the moist pastures, some on the\r\nploughed land, hard at work searching for grubs and worms. The bachelor\r\nrooks were also looking out for partners, and some of them were already\r\nsettled in life--for that season at least.\r\n\r\nThere was a certain young bachelor among them who had not as yet won his\r\nway to the heart of any black maiden. Jetsom had certain ways about him\r\nthat were looked on with suspicion by his fellows. His father and mother\r\nhad had some doubt whether they ought to bring him up. His very egg had\r\nbeen unlike the others in the nest; it was longer and narrower, and not\r\nso thickly covered with dark spots. It was clearly an ill-omened egg. A\r\none-eyed old rook, famed for wisdom and foresight, had been consulted\r\nabout it, and was of opinion that no good would come of it. He sat on\r\nthe edge of the nest, and turned his battered old bill this way and\r\nthat, uttering now and then a hoarse inward caw. “I remember,” said he\r\nat last, “an egg exactly like this; it was the year the new allotments\r\nwere made, long before you two were born. It was a lucky year in that\r\nway, for those allotments are a great blessing to us all, though you\r\nyoung folks don’t value them as you ought. But let me tell you (and here\r\nhe ruffled his feathers, and made a dab with his bill at the unlucky\r\negg), the chick from that egg became a scare-crow on those allotments!”\r\n\r\nAnd overcome with his emotions, he gave several loud caws, and flew away\r\nto his own tree, leaving the young parents in great anxiety.\r\n\r\n“We’d better turn it out,” said the father; “it’ll never do to see his\r\nbody on a stake every time we go to feed in the allotments.”\r\n\r\n“Let us hatch it first,” said the mother, “and see what it looks like.\r\nThat old Gaffer thinks himself too wise; if it turns out all right we’ll\r\nproclaim him as a humbug.”\r\n\r\nThis was too tempting a proposal to be resisted. The egg continued in\r\nthe nest, and in due time it was hatched. There was no difference\r\nbetween the chick of the queer egg, and those that came from the others.\r\nThe mother-bird was right, and on the strength of this she got her own\r\nway in other matters. Her husband had loved and admired her, and now he\r\nalso obeyed her, because of her prudence and wisdom. When old Gaffer\r\ncame, uninvited, to look at the chick, she actually ordered her husband\r\nto drive him away; which he did with such valour that the old gentleman\r\nlost three of his tail feathers, and retired in great wrath to a\r\nneighbouring branch to recover his breath. When he had got it he croaked\r\nout a dismal prophecy for the chick, which struck terror into the hearts\r\nof the rooks in that tree; and in fact the whole matter was the cause\r\nof much scandal.\r\n\r\nOld Gaffer did not venture to the nest again; his reputation for wisdom\r\nhad been shaken, and his damaged tail was secretly made fun of by the\r\nyounger birds. But he let it be known through a friend that there was no\r\ndoubt whatever in his mind that young Jetsom would be shot--and serve\r\nhim right--at the rook-shooting next month. It is only the oldest birds\r\nthat think of the shooting beforehand; they know it is coming and take\r\nit as a matter of course. The colony must not be overstocked with young\r\nbirds, which are often impudent and annoying, and the old inhabitants\r\nare not sorry to get rid of them.\r\n\r\nWhen May came the young birds were one day perching on the edges of\r\ntheir nests, and taking short flights to exercise their wings; Jetsom\r\nwas among them, as fine a young bird as any, and the peculiar pride of\r\nhis parents. Some men came under the trees with guns, the parent-birds\r\ncawed loudly to their young, and all was noise and disturbance. Bang\r\nwent the guns; half-a-dozen young rooks fell dead or struggling through\r\nthe branches. The others took flight a short way, but thinking all was\r\nsafe again, returned very soon to their tree. Young Jetsom however, who\r\nwas stronger of wing than most, got carried on by a gust of wind, and\r\nfound himself very soon over a ploughed field, where a few rooks were\r\npeaceably feeding. He dropped down on it, rather flustered and tired,\r\nand seeing the other birds poking their bills into the ground, and\r\nturning over the clods, began to do the same. Presently one of them came\r\nnear him, looked at him, cawed, flapped its wings, and said, “Who are\r\nyou? You don’t belong to us.”\r\n\r\nJetsom explained as well as he could.\r\n\r\n“My young friend,” said the rook, “you had better make haste and go.\r\nIt’s my duty to hustle you to death for coming here, and I shall do it\r\nif you stay another minute. Be off, before the others see you. Here they\r\ncome--”\r\n\r\nJetsom heard no more; he was off, and on the other side of the nearest\r\nhedge, before the other rooks could come up; and there he lay for some\r\ntime, too frightened at first to think. When he recovered himself life\r\npresented itself to him in a new aspect; it was evidently not all grubs\r\nand wire-worms. It was rather a serious matter. There were other rooks\r\nbesides those of his colony, and they were not friendly. It was possible\r\nto get hustled to death by them. How much there was to be learnt in the\r\nworld! You had hard work to keep the skin on your bones, to avoid being\r\nshot, made a scare-crow of, hustled to death. Why was all this? Why not\r\nlive in peace with your neighbours? Why should men shoot at you when\r\nthey laid out allotments for your express benefit? All this was very\r\npuzzling to Jetsom, as he lay still under the hedge; things were\r\ncertainly not as they should be. He could hear the shooting going on in\r\nthe distance, but at last it stopped, and he summoned up courage to take\r\nflight homewards.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the tree, and perched tired out on the first branch he\r\ncame to, all was hubbub and confusion: but above the din he could hear\r\nthe hoarse voice of old Gaffer, who had ventured himself quite close to\r\nthe nest, and was addressing his parents.\r\n\r\n“Do you know what they do with the young birds they shoot?” said that\r\nwell-informed old bird. “They pull all the feathers out of their bodies,\r\nput them all together into a big dish, and bake them over the fire. Then\r\nthey eat them, and the cat and the dog get the bones. I’ve seen it all\r\nthrough the window. That ill-omened young Jetsom is in the pie-dish now.\r\nTake advice when you can get it. The cook plucked him an hour ago.\r\nCapital eating, you may be sure! You fed him so well with worms, you\r\nknow. So kind of you! Take advice when you can get it. I see the smoke\r\ncoming out of the chimney now; they’re baking down below. You’ll find\r\nhis feathers in the back-yard presently. Take advice--”\r\n\r\n“Stop that, and go and look for your tail-feathers,” said the angry\r\nvoice of the mother. And she ordered her husband to drive the old wretch\r\naway, but at that moment Jetsom flew into the nest. Great was the\r\ndelight and excitement of the parents; but seeing his exhausted state,\r\nhis mother sent her husband off on the instant for a cargo of worms, and\r\nwhen she bethought herself next of old Gaffer, that prudent old rook was\r\nnot to be seen.\r\n\r\nIt was a great triumph. Gaffer’s fame as a prophet was at the lowest\r\nebb. But he knew the ways of the world, and the foibles of his kind; he\r\nstuck to his point none the less for his defeat, and never ceased to\r\nassert that young Jetsom was a mistake, and ought never to have been\r\nhatched out. Some of the older birds shared this opinion, and as time\r\nwent on Gaffer began to notice with great satisfaction that Jetsom was\r\nof a disposition likely to get him into trouble.\r\n\r\nThe fact was that his first adventure had caused him to reflect on the\r\nnature of things; and, as we all know, that is a dangerous habit to get\r\ninto. He had told them of his adventure with the foreign rooks, and had\r\nreceived most strict injunctions to have nothing to do with them\r\nhenceforward. He naturally asked why, but was sharply told to hold his\r\ntongue. His mother told him ghastly stories of what happened to young\r\nrooks who asked questions; and his father sat on a twig close by and\r\ncawed his admiration of his wife’s wisdom and eloquence.\r\n\r\nOld Gaffer watched them at a safe distance, and promised himself revenge\r\nfor the loss of his tail-feathers.\r\n\r\nAll these dreadful stories had their due effect on Jetsom’s mind, and he\r\nasked no more questions, but he could not help reflecting silently on\r\nthe nature of things. And so it came to pass that he grew up a silent\r\nand philosophical rook, and it was frequently remarked that he did not\r\nmake his proper contribution to that chorus of cawing which at certain\r\ntimes of the day is so necessary to the happiness and comfort of a\r\nrookery. He would sometimes, too, decline to accompany the others when\r\nthey wheeled about in the air of an evening before settling down to\r\nroost; and from his solitary habits was often chosen to sit on a tree as\r\nsentinel when the rest were at work feeding on a ploughed field. His\r\nfather and mother were quite content that this should be so, and so was\r\nhe, for it redeemed him a little from the suspicion that was beginning\r\nto\r\n\r\n[Illustration:....Deep in meditation on the problem which occupied his\r\nmind.--P. 141.]\r\n\r\nfall on him; and he would often sit on his perch by the hour, pretending\r\nto keep a look-out, but really deep in meditation on the problems which\r\noccupied his mind.\r\n\r\nAnd so the winter passed; and with the first approach of spring the\r\nyoung birds of the year began to find themselves mates, and to think\r\nwhat tree they should select to nest in; but on that day in February\r\nwith which this veracious story began, Jetsom had not yet found a bride.\r\nYet he was too much of a rook to consider his spring complete without\r\nthe duty and honour of bringing up a nestful of young, as his fathers\r\nhad done before him.\r\n\r\nThat morning the billing and cooing (or rather cawing) of the lovers was\r\nvery distasteful to him; they played such silly games, and talked such\r\namorous rubbish. No one took any notice of him, until at last a flirting\r\npair came in playful pursuit of each other close up to the railing on\r\nwhich he sat disconsolate, and he heard the young lady ask her lover not\r\nto take her near that horrid Jetsom.\r\n\r\n“He’s got an evil eye,” she said, “and if I marry you (which I probably\r\nsha’n’t), depend on it all the eggs will be addled.” And off she flew,\r\nwith her admirer after her.\r\n\r\nThis was too much for Jetsom; he also took flight to escape further\r\ninsult; and flying straight ahead while he meditated on his wrongs, he\r\npassed over several miles of open country before he found himself\r\nhungry, and descended on a juicy-looking meadow to look about for food.\r\nHe had not been there long, when, happening to look round, he saw that\r\nthere was another rook in the field; only one, walking slowly about in a\r\nfar corner. Flying quietly a little nearer, he perceived by her ways\r\nthat she was a young maiden of scarce a year old. Every moment he\r\nexpected to hear the caws of her companions, and prepared to fly for his\r\nlife; but none came, and she continued to walk about with a pensive air,\r\nturning her head from side to side, and wholly unconscious of his\r\npresence. But forced by curiosity, he came nearer and nearer, and now\r\nshe could not help noticing that she was not alone.\r\n\r\n“Oblige me, sir,” she said, “by retiring from this corner. I have not\r\nthe honour of your acquaintance, and am at present engaged in reflecting\r\non the problems of life.”\r\n\r\n“So,” said Jetsom, “am I; allow me to ask what you make of them?”\r\n\r\n“I can make nothing of them,” she replied; “I run my bill against a\r\npebble everywhere, and cannot get hold of a single worm. Perhaps you\r\nhave been more fortunate. For my part, I find the ground everywhere hard\r\nfrozen; I can make no impression on it. Excuse my putting my ideas in\r\nthis vulgar way.”\r\n\r\n“Your field of thought may be hard,” he said, “but your words are soft\r\nand sweet as the juiciest grubs. I am an outcast, because I think; and I\r\nfind comfort in listening to an alien voice. But destiny surrounds us,\r\nas the hedge surrounds this field; we rooks are bound by eternal and\r\nimmutable laws; and one of them forbids us, as you have reminded me, to\r\nhave anything to do with an alien. I must apologize for my intrusion,\r\nand retire to my life of misery.”\r\n\r\n“Stay,” said she; “we are alone and unseen. Your presence is not\r\ndisagreeable to me. Destiny, if it keeps aliens apart, has at least\r\nbrought you to me. Day changes to night, summer to winter; old trees\r\nwear out (so my grandmother tells me) and we are obliged to take to new\r\nones. Can it be that the nature of our race never changes too? Is there\r\nnot a future to be realized when the narrowing bonds of our society may\r\nbe relaxed, and when in ever-widening circles our race may stir the\r\nworld with a new life? And may it not be you--you the outcast and\r\nphilosopher--who are destined to lead the van in this glorious\r\nmovement?”\r\n\r\n“I!” he replied. “Can it be so? But not alone--not alone.” And he\r\nglanced at her curiously.\r\n\r\n“Hush,” she hurriedly whispered; “I heard a distant caw. Meet me here\r\nagain to-morrow when the sun is at its highest.” And so they parted, to\r\nmeditate on the destinies of the ages, and the enfranchisement of\r\nrook-society.\r\n\r\nWhen Jetsom returned to his rookery he found that his absence had not\r\nbeen noticed, so occupied was every one with the business of wooing and\r\nstick-collecting; and he kept his appointment next day without much\r\nmisgiving. What fears he had were easily overcome by the thought that\r\nthere might be a great and happy future in store for him if he could\r\ninduce his new acquaintance to become his partner, and to help him to\r\ncarry out in practice the ideas that were floating through their minds.\r\nHe little knew, poor bird, what was really in store for him. Though he\r\nhad not been aware of it, one eye had all this time been upon him. Old\r\nGaffer, who was always on the look-out for his chance of revenge, had\r\nseen him leave the meadow, and noticed his late return; and when he made\r\nquietly off again the next day, Gaffer as quietly followed him. From a\r\ntree near the trysting-place he saw Jetsom meet his friend, and knew in\r\na twinkling that his chance had come. He watched them for a while as\r\nthey walked about the meadow together, deep in philosophic converse; but\r\nwhen they flew up into a tree (luckily it was not Gaffer’s) with some\r\nlittle serious attempt to play with each other, he felt he might go home\r\nsafely and consider what was the best plan to bring this wilful pair to\r\nshame and ruin.\r\n\r\nSlipping warily out of his tree he flew slowly homewards, and before he\r\nreached the rookery had made up his mind as to what should be done. He\r\nmentioned to a few old friends, the ancient dignitaries of the\r\nsettlement, that he wished to consult them at once on an important\r\nmatter; and a meeting was accordingly held on a tree hard by. An aged\r\nand highly respected bird, with two white feathers in his wing, was\r\nvoted into the chair, who, taking his perch on a prominent bough,\r\nrequested Gaffer to open his mind.\r\n\r\n“My friends,” said Gaffer, turning his one eye with an evil look round\r\nand round upon the assembly, “you will perhaps remember that last spring\r\nI was asked advice about a certain egg, and that my advice was not\r\ntaken. I will ask you whether that egg has been a credit to our\r\nrookery?”\r\n\r\nA chorus of cawing encouraged him to proceed.\r\n\r\n“I will not allude,” said he, “to painful circumstances connected with\r\nthat egg, and to personal insults which I suffered on account of that\r\negg. I may feel that I hardly received at that time the support which I\r\nmight have looked for from the older and wiser among us. But let bygones\r\nbe bygones. I have to tell you that the bird which was the ill-omened\r\nresult of that egg is about to bring home a wife who is not one of our\r\ncommunity. (Great disturbance, lasting several minutes.) I have watched,\r\nand I have seen the guilty pair but an hour since, and we may expect\r\nthem at any moment. This is painful news to have to tell you, but I must\r\nsacrifice my own feelings. I wish to know what line of action you would\r\npropose that we should take?”\r\n\r\nAlmost before he had finished speaking, such a hubbub of indignation\r\narose, that the president had the utmost difficulty in restoring order.\r\n\r\n“Friends,” said he at length, “let us take a flight to calm our spirits\r\nafter the terrible news which has been sprung upon us; then we will\r\ndeliberate on the case.”\r\n\r\nAgreed. They all sailed about above the tree for a few minutes, and then\r\ndescended again, cawing so loud that a passing wayfarer looked up at\r\nthe tree in astonishment. The president then called on the oldest rook\r\nin company to give his opinion.\r\n\r\n“Kill her,” he said; “it’s the shortest way and the least trouble. As\r\nfor him, he’ll soon get over it.”\r\n\r\nThis proposal was received with a round of cawing, in which Gaffer did\r\nnot join. When it came to an end the President asked whether any one\r\nelse had a plan to propose. A worthy old rook flapped her wings and\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n“I object to killing. It excites the young birds. When they have done it\r\nonce they want to do it again. We might be breaking up the very\r\nfoundations of society by encouraging this kind of punishment. Let them\r\nbuild in a tree by themselves. Live and let live, I say.”\r\n\r\nThis plan found a few supporters, but more assailants: Gaffer prudently\r\nheld his tongue. Every one began to give his own opinion, and the two\r\nopposing parties got so angry that the president felt obliged to order\r\nanother flight. When they returned, Gaffer spoke as follows:--\r\n\r\n“I hope my worthy friends who have made their proposals, will not take\r\nit amiss if I state my opinion that they are both open to serious\r\nobjection. If we kill this upstart’s bride, surely we shall be leaving\r\nthe real criminal unpunished. (Loud caws of approval.) If on the other\r\nhand we let them build in a tree by themselves, they will bring up their\r\nyoung, and instead of having two rebellious birds to deal with, we shall\r\nhave a whole family to keep aloof from. I ask you, is it likely, is it\r\npossible, that we should be able to keep our young birds from\r\nassociating with them? Now what I propose is this: let them come and try\r\nto build in our trees, as I know they will; let us tell our younger\r\nbirds, who will be very glad of the job, to take away every stick they\r\nbring, and worry them till they are sick of it. If they get a few\r\nbruises, or a broken leg or wing, so much the better; if they give up\r\nthe attempt, and go elsewhere, we shall have got rid of bad rubbish\r\n(applause), and they won’t get on better anywhere else, depend upon it.\r\nIf any rook here thinks that I have a personal grudge against this young\r\nJetsom, I trust that the moderation of this proposal will undeceive\r\nhim. I request the President to put my motion to the vote without\r\ndelay.” (Much cawing.)\r\n\r\nThe President did as he was desired; and the motion was carried by a\r\nlarge majority. Each old bird was then directed to tell his younger\r\nfriends that they might freely take any nesting materials collected by\r\nJetsom and his spouse; and the meeting broke up.\r\n\r\nThe victim of these hard-minded old birds brought his wife home that\r\nnight, and they roosted in one of the trees without being molested or\r\neven noticed. Next morning early they set about choosing a place for a\r\nnest, and while they were looking about, Gaffer sent a polite message,\r\nby a lively young bird, that an excellent position was vacant in his\r\ntree. The wily old gentleman wished to witness the success of his plot,\r\nwithout taking part in the proceedings himself. Jetsom began to think he\r\nwas getting into Gaffer’s good books again, and gladly accepted the\r\noffer. “That old fellow,” he said to his wife, “is a great authority\r\nhere, and if we can enlist him in the great cause, it will be the best\r\nthing that could happen to us. Now, my dear, we will begin our labours\r\ncheerfully.”\r\n\r\nAll that day they went backwards and forwards bringing sticks to lay the\r\nfoundation of the nest; and Gaffer sat on a high bough and looked down\r\non them benignly with his one eye. He even condescended once or twice to\r\ngive them a little advice as to how the sticks should be placed. In the\r\nevening they went off to rest, bathe, and enjoy a little conversation\r\nabout the happy future of the race of rooks; and a happier or more\r\nloving pair of birds were not to be found in all that large rookery. How\r\ntheir hearts sank within them on their return when they found that every\r\nstick they had laid had been taken away!\r\n\r\nGaffer was still sitting there, looking very wise: and Jetsom asked him\r\nwho had done them this bad turn, and why.\r\n\r\n“My dear young friend,” said Gaffer, with an ill-concealed leer, “these\r\nare little troubles that we have all had to go through. It’s only fun,\r\nyou may be sure. Some of those idle young birds have been amusing\r\nthemselves at your expense. Don’t be disheartened: begin again.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, you dear, kind old bird,” said Jetsom’s wife. “How good of\r\nyou to take such an interest in us. May I have a little talk with you\r\nsome day about the problems of life?”\r\n\r\nGaffer was overpoweringly polite. “My dear,” he said, “you do me great\r\nhonour. I shall be delighted to discuss them with you. But perhaps you\r\nwill solve them for yourselves.” And he seemed to leer at her with his\r\nvacant eye, while he winked the other at a friend in a tree hard by.\r\n\r\nThe work began again next day; the same thing happened again, and again\r\nGaffer encouraged them to persevere. Next day Jetsom stayed on guard,\r\nwhile his wife collected sticks. Seeing this, Gaffer took himself off,\r\nand only returned to find, to his extreme delight, his victim in a very\r\nruffled state, the other rooks in possession of all his sticks, and his\r\nwife in very low spirits. She appealed to him to protect them.\r\n\r\n“My dear,” said Gaffer, “this is one of the problems of life. You are\r\nnow beginning to face the facts of the world. Go on, persevere, and\r\nsooner or later you will solve the problems.”\r\n\r\nThe luckless pair took his advice once more, and day after day went on\r\ncollecting their sticks, only to find them stolen directly their backs\r\nwere turned. If one remained on guard, battles ensued; and Gaffer could\r\nhardly repress his delight when he saw Jetsom’s feathers begin to fall\r\noff in these fights. Several times he had to retire by himself to a\r\ndistant tree, to enjoy his revenge in solitude.\r\n\r\nAt last the younger birds began to get tired of this game, and having\r\nfinished their own nests, were no longer in want of the sticks that\r\nJetsom collected. Gaffer began to get sulky and anxious. He sat on his\r\nbough and saw the nest beginning to rise at last: something must be done\r\nat once. He waited till both birds were away together; then down he went\r\non the nest and began to pull it all to pieces. But it was a long job\r\nfor one bill, and before he had done, back came the owners. Gaffer was\r\nsurprised, and was quite unable to persuade them that he was only\r\nhelping to arrange the sticks; it was all too plain. Jetsom fell into a\r\nfury that frightened his poor wife out of her wits, and before Gaffer\r\ncould stammer out something about “the problems of life,” he was\r\nattacked, pecked, driven from one tree to another, worried, pushed,\r\nflapped at, till his one eye closed for ever, and he fell to the ground\r\nlifeless. But the problems of life had been too much for Jetsom. He felt\r\na moment of glorious triumph as his enemy fell, and was just returning\r\nto his wife and nest with pride and honour, with heart swelling with joy\r\nand hope: when his senses gave way, his bill opened, his eyes grew dim,\r\nand in the moment of victory he expired, falling to the ground by the\r\nside of his conquered foe. He had solved his problem.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later a gentleman walking down the road, stopped to watch a\r\nstrange assembly of rooks in an adjoining meadow. They were standing in\r\na large circle, making a great noise; in the centre of the circle stood\r\na single rook, ruffled and miserable-looking. As he watched, the noise\r\ngradually ceased, and after a moment’s silence, the whole company rose\r\non their wings and rushed upon the victim in the middle. The noise again\r\nbecame deafening, and nothing could be seen but a _mêlée_ of wings,\r\ntails, and beaks, on the spot where the solitary bird had been seen a\r\nmoment before. The gentleman scrambled over the hedge, waving his stick\r\nand shouting: the rooks flew away with loud cawings. When he reached the\r\nspot, he found nothing but a mangled mass of feathers--the lifeless body\r\nof one miserable bird.\r\n\r\nIt was the body of Jetsom’s widow. She too had solved the problem of her\r\nlife, and the rookery was no longer troubled with revolutionary ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA QUESTION BEGINNING WITH “WHY.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOne warm summer afternoon two young men were leaning out of a window,\r\nsmoking their pipes, and enjoying a lazy half-hour. The window was one\r\nof a long row in the garden-quadrangle of an old gray Oxford college;\r\nand you looked out of it on a beautiful close-shaven lawn, bordered with\r\nflower beds, and inclosed on one side by one of watery Oxford’s many\r\nstreams. This lawn, in the summer, is never without its family of\r\nwater-wagtails. Here there is no fear of bird-nesting boys, and\r\ncomparatively little peril of cats; and the turf is mown so often and so\r\nclosely, that even the youngest bird can find his food there without the\r\nleast trouble. And there they were that July afternoon, sometimes\r\nrunning so quickly that you quite lost sight of their little black legs,\r\nthen stopping suddenly and moving their tails rapidly up and down for a\r\nfew moments, then pouncing upon some unlucky insect on the grass, or\r\nperhaps pursuing it in the air with a quick fluttering of wings and\r\ntails; and all the while uttering that contented little double-note of\r\ntheirs, which seemed to say to the occupants of the old panelled rooms\r\nabove them, “This is real happiness; we take what comes, and ask no\r\nquestions; _we_ don’t puzzle our heads over Philosophy, and Biology, and\r\nConstitutional History, and Economical Science. Why, even _you_ wouldn’t\r\nbe trying to find out a reason for everything, if you weren’t afraid the\r\nExaminers were going to ask you for it! Come down here and lie on this\r\nbeautiful lawn in the shade, and forget all about the why and the\r\nwherefore. Take things as you find them; there are no Examiners about\r\njust now!”\r\n\r\nThe two young men were not thinking of the wagtails; but neither were\r\nthey thinking of anything else in particular, and the invitation to go\r\nand lie on the lawn found its way somehow into their temporarily vacant\r\nminds. They put on their flannels and their boating coats and went and\r\nstretched themselves at full length under the cool shade of an acacia.\r\nThere they lay quite quiet and happy, and were for some time so silent\r\nthat the wagtails ventured up quite close to them without any sign of\r\nfear.\r\n\r\nOne was a poet; at least his friends thought him one, and as he himself\r\nwas not quite sure that they were right, it is not impossible that he\r\nhad a few poetic streaks in his nature. The other was a student of\r\nscience, and spent most of his time in cutting earth-worms and frogs\r\ninto beautiful little slices, and looking at them through a microscope.\r\nThey had a liking for each other, because neither fully understood the\r\nother’s thoughts and ambitions; so there was plenty of room for\r\ncomfortable silence, and cosy human companionship.\r\n\r\nAt last the silence was broken by the poet. He spoke as much to himself\r\nas to his friend.\r\n\r\n“It’s very puzzling,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Very,” said the man of science, without taking his pipe from his lips,\r\nand not in the least knowing what the other was thinking of. At this\r\nmoment a young wagtail took a long run, and stopped, in all the innocent\r\nfearlessness of youth, within half-a-dozen yards of them. There was a\r\npause again.\r\n\r\n“I never can make out,” at last pursued the poet, “why Shakespeare wrote\r\nno more plays during the last years of his life. He wasn’t old, and he\r\nmust have had plenty of time at Stratford.”\r\n\r\n“He probably liked better to lie in his garden and think of nothing at\r\nall,” said the other. “But I don’t see why you want to find out. Much\r\nbetter to leave the poor man alone.--”\r\n\r\n“Why, what do you do all day up at the Museum?” asked the poet. “I\r\nthought you were always trying to find out something or other. I dare\r\nsay you’d like to find out why that bird wags its tail,” he added, as\r\nthe young wagtail made another little run forward, and stood there just\r\nin his line of vision with her tail going gently up and down.\r\n\r\n“Why it wags its tail?” said the man of science: “you just catch it and\r\nbring it up to the Museum, and we’ll soon tell you why it wags its\r\ntail. It’s only a matter of nerves and muscles, and spinal cord you\r\nknow, and all that sort of thing. The professor would soon put you up to\r\nall that. But that reminds me that I said I’d help him with some\r\nspecimens this afternoon, and it’s past three o’clock.” And up he\r\njumped, and ran off to get his hat, startling the young wagtail, which\r\nflew away to the other end of the lawn.\r\n\r\nLittle did these two lads know how much trouble and anxiety their\r\nconversation was to bring upon the inhabitants of that peaceful lawn.\r\nThat young wagtail had heard what they said; for birds certainly\r\nunderstand what men say. Do they not carry secrets? People should be\r\ncareful what they say in their hearing.\r\n\r\nNow up to this time this young bird, like her brothers and sisters, had\r\nnever given a moment’s thought to what she did, or what she looked like.\r\nNor had she noticed what the others did, or what they looked like. She\r\nwagged her tail, but she did it without thinking of it; as for asking\r\nwhy she did it, that was very far from the mind of herself or any of the\r\nfamily. And now she suddenly became aware, not only that she did it,\r\nbut that it was possible to ask _why she did it_.\r\n\r\nShe looked at the others: they were all doing it, every other minute or\r\nso. Then she wagged her own tail, to see what it felt like, now she knew\r\nthat she did it. And now she began to feel very ill at ease.\r\n\r\n“What can it all be for?” she said to herself. “Even that man didn’t\r\nseem to know all about it. There goes my tail again! Really, it wags\r\nalmost without one’s knowing it. There can’t be any harm in it, I should\r\nthink, as father and mother are doing it too. But why do we all do it? I\r\ndon’t see any use in it. There it goes again, before I ever thought of\r\nholding it still. I must really go and ask mother about it.”\r\n\r\nShe flew up to her mother, who was in a very happy and contented frame\r\nof mind, having brought up her young so prosperously in the midst of\r\nplenty and comfort.\r\n\r\n“Mother,” she said, “will you please tell me why we all wag our tails?”\r\n\r\nThe prudent mother was rather taken aback; but after taking a little\r\nrun and flight, to collect her mind, she returned answer very decidedly,\r\n\r\n“We don’t wag our tails. Who’s been putting such fancies into your\r\nhead?”\r\n\r\n“A big man on the other side of the lawn said he should like to know why\r\nwe wag our tails!”\r\n\r\n“Men are blockheads,” said the mother. “Don’t you go near them, Kelpie,\r\non any account. They know nothing about us. I tell you we don’t wag our\r\ntails, and I won’t be contradicted. Go away, child, and look for\r\nbeetles.”\r\n\r\nKelpie went away, but she could not throw herself into the\r\nbeetle-catching with the same ardour as before. Whenever she looked up\r\nshe saw some one’s tail moving, and she got more and more puzzled over\r\nit. At one moment she thought she was rid of the puzzle: “Mother says we\r\ndon’t,” she reflected, “so of course, at least I suppose, it’s all my\r\nfancy;” and she began to search for food. But the next minute she felt\r\nthat her own tail was going up and down, and back came all the puzzling\r\nthoughts as lively as ever again. At last she lost all confidence in her\r\nmother, and resolved to ask her father’s opinion.\r\n\r\n“What does my little Kelpie want?” said he, as the young one came flying\r\nup.\r\n\r\n“I want to ask a question, father. Mother says we don’t wag our tails,\r\nbut a man I heard talking said we did. Which do you think is right?”\r\n\r\n“Your mother’s sure to be right, my dear,” said he; “I never, never knew\r\nher wrong. Never,” he said with warmth, and wagging his tail to\r\nemphasize his words. “Believe all she says, and do everything she tells\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“But father, dear, you’re wagging your own tail now as fast as you can!”\r\ncried Kelpie.\r\n\r\n“I do it sometimes when I am a little excited,” he said, taken by\r\nsurprise. “But don’t you think any more about it, Kelpie, there’s a\r\ndear; it would vex your mother so, you know. And promise me you won’t\r\nsay anything about it to your brothers and sisters. Will you promise?\r\nAll sorts of dreadful things might happen, you know, if one went about\r\nasking questions like that.”\r\n\r\nWorse and worse for poor Kelpie! Her mother had plainly told her an\r\nuntruth; her father had half admitted it to be so, and had seemed quite\r\nfrightened at the idea of such questions being asked. What could the\r\nmystery be? Kelpie’s little mind was all in a flutter.\r\n\r\nShe went on as usual however from day to day, and said nothing to the\r\nrest of the family about the troubles of her mind. At last however it\r\nstruck her that she might question other birds, though it was clearly no\r\ngood consulting her own kith and kin. A thrush who frequented the lawn,\r\nand always looked very wise, seemed likely to be a friend in need; so\r\nshe took an opportunity one day, when the others were out of hearing, of\r\nasking him her question.\r\n\r\nThe thrush put his head on one side, and listened very attentively while\r\nKelpie was speaking. “Now,” thought she, “I shall get an answer. Oh,\r\nwhat a relief.” She stood quite still and waited patiently.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said the thrush, quite suddenly, “I thought I heard it!” And he\r\nmade a quick dig into the earth with his bill, and pulled out a long\r\nworm by the tail. Kelpie watched while he swallowed it,--it did not take\r\nmore than a few seconds--and then said timidly, “If you please, sir, I\r\ndon’t think you heard me, I--”\r\n\r\nThe thrush again put his head on one side, stood quite still in an erect\r\nattitude, and seemed absorbed this time in Kelpie and her troubles.\r\n\r\n“I asked you a question, sir,” said she again; “I’m very much afraid I’m\r\ntroubling you, but I do _so_ want to find out the answer.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve found it,” said the thrush, as suddenly as before; and he darted\r\nhis bill into the ground again, pulled out another worm, and this time\r\nflew away with it. Kelpie was left alone, a sadder but not a wiser bird.\r\n\r\nShe was greatly disheartened for a time. At last however she determined\r\nto try once more. An old jackdaw, with a very gray head, used to come\r\nvery early of a morning on to the lawn when no one was about except a\r\nfew starlings. Kelpie didn’t think the starlings looked very promising,\r\nthey were so restless, and there were so many of them together. But the\r\njackdaw, she had heard her parents say, was the wisest bird in the whole\r\ngarden; so she watched her chance, and approached him one morning very\r\nmodestly.\r\n\r\n“I fear, sir,” she said, “that you will think me very bold, but I have\r\nheard of your great wisdom, and I thought you would be good enough to\r\nexplain something to me.”\r\n\r\nThe jackdaw looked at her, not unkindly. “Have you asked your parents?”\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, but they won’t explain it to me.”\r\n\r\nThe jackdaw shook his head. “Probably they couldn’t,” he replied.\r\n“Wagtails are very ignorant birds. But I’ll give you a bit of advice. If\r\nanything puzzles you, go and listen in chimneys. There are no fires\r\nthere now, and you can hear what men and women say. That’s how my family\r\nhas come to be so wise. But you must get into the habit of it, you know;\r\nyou must spend a good deal of time there; it may be years before you get\r\nan answer to your question.”\r\n\r\n“But perhaps _you_ could answer my question,” said Kelpie; “because, you\r\nsee, you might have heard the answer yourself in a chimney.”\r\n\r\n“No doubt, no doubt,” said the jackdaw gravely. “But, my dear child,\r\nwhat would be the use of knowledge if we were always giving it away,\r\nlike the lecturers we hear from these Oxford chimneys? No, no; you go\r\nand listen in chimneys (you’re black and gray, like us, and it wouldn’t\r\nspoil your feathers), and when you find out the answer to your question\r\nkeep it safe and don’t part with it. That’s the way to get wise.”\r\n\r\nThe jackdaw made a grave bow, and flew up to the college tower. Kelpie\r\nflew on to the college roof, perched on a chimney, and looked down. It\r\nsmelt very nasty and was quite dark; however she tried to descend a\r\nlittle way, but she got so frightened that she came up again directly,\r\nand gave up the attempt for good.\r\n\r\n“I must give it up,” she thought; and with a deep sigh she joined her\r\nfamily at their breakfast on the lawn. She found them in a state of some\r\nexcitement, for after breakfast father Wagtail was to make an important\r\nannouncement.\r\n\r\n“My dears,” he said, when they had all gathered round him, “the summer\r\nis almost over; you are all old enough to shift for yourselves, and our\r\nlittle party must now break up. We may very likely meet again, but your\r\nmother and I, having brought you up as well as we can, will not be\r\nresponsible for you any longer. You are free to go when and where you\r\nlike. Some of you may like to cross the sea, and visit foreign\r\ncountries; some may prefer to take the chance of a mild winter here. Do\r\njust as you like: but we advise you all to travel more or less, and get\r\nacquainted with the world. Now good-bye, and good luck to you all.”\r\n\r\nKelpie was overjoyed at hearing this news. She had not been happy for a\r\nlong time; now she could go out into the wide world, and try to find out\r\nthe answer to the question that so weighed on her mind. She bade adieu\r\nto the rest at once, and started off by herself in high spirits. She\r\nwould be very careful, she thought, as to whom she questioned, and would\r\ntry and find some really friendly and open-hearted adviser.\r\n\r\nShe was so occupied with all the new and strange things she saw--the\r\nrivers, the ploughed fields, the hills and downs she passed over, and so\r\ndetermined not to be put upon any more by thrushes and jackdaws, that\r\nautumn had set in before she ventured to address a single bird on the\r\nsubject she had at heart. But one day in September she was enjoying\r\nherself by the side of a rapid little brook which ran through pleasant\r\nmeadows, when she caught sight of a very long tail going up and down, up\r\nand down. The bird it belonged to was hidden behind a stone in the\r\nstream. She watched, and saw a gray wagtail come from behind the stone,\r\nand fly with graceful curves a little further on, then she saw another\r\nbird join him, and stood in speechless admiration of these beautiful\r\ncreatures, so slender, so gentle-looking, and so beautifully covered\r\nwith gray above and yellow beneath. But what most fascinated her was the\r\nmotion of their long tails, which were never for a moment still.\r\n\r\nShe went up and introduced herself. They received her kindly as a\r\ndistant connection, and said she was welcome to the brook; and in their\r\ncompany she remained for the greater part of the day, before she\r\nsummoned up courage to open her heart to them.\r\n\r\n“You are very kind and good,” she said at last, “and I think you must be\r\nvery clever too. Would you mind telling me, as I see you wag your own\r\ntails so constantly and so nicely, why you do it, and why all our family\r\ndo it too? If you only would, I should be so happy and grateful; you\r\ncan’t think how it’s been troubling me!”\r\n\r\nThe gray wagtail looked at his wife, and she looked at him, and they\r\nseemed to nod to one another in rather an odd way.\r\n\r\n“Dear, dear!” said the wife,--“what a sad pity!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear me, dear me!” said the husband, “how sad! And such a nice\r\nyoung creature too! What can we do for her?”\r\n\r\nThe wife shook her head silently; Kelpie felt dreadfully ashamed of\r\nherself. What could be the matter?\r\n\r\n“Please tell me if I have done anything wrong,” she said.\r\n\r\n“My dear,” said the wife very kindly, “I fear you are not very well. If\r\nI were you I should\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Would you mind telling me, as I see you wag your own\r\ntails so constantly and so nicely, why you do it?”--P. 170.]\r\n\r\nget advice as soon as possible. I strongly recommend the kingfisher, who\r\nlives yonder up the brook; I believe he is very clever in cases like\r\nyours, and he eats fish, which is very good for the brain, you know.\r\nYou’ll be sure to find him if you wait about a little. I am very sorry,\r\nmy dear, but we must go away, for they say it’s extremely catching.” And\r\nfollowed by her husband she flew away down the stream.\r\n\r\nKelpie was now quite frightened. Something seemed to be altogether wrong\r\nwith her. She began to think she must have eaten something that fatal\r\nday on the lawn, which was growing up inside her, and causing her all\r\nthis trouble. She hastened away up the brook, and after searching for a\r\nwhile, she found the kingfisher sitting on a bough overhanging the\r\nstream. She addressed him without any apology, for she wanted dreadfully\r\nto know what was the matter with her; and she poured out her whole sad\r\nstory from beginning to end. The kingfisher sat quite quiet on his\r\nbough, and listened with great attention.\r\n\r\n“Yours is a very curious case,” he said when she had done; “a very\r\ninteresting case indeed. I should strongly recommend constant change of\r\nscene; a tour on the Continent, now, would be very likely to do you\r\ngood. Frequent application of cold water could hardly fail to be useful;\r\nkeep to your usual insect diet, but vary it a little with the small\r\ncrustaceans you will find in the stream; I can speak warmly of their\r\nvalue from my own experience; they are an excellent tonic. This is what\r\nI advise you to do; but if you should find yourself still troubled, I\r\nshould go to some one who has made a special study of these cases, which\r\nI have not.”\r\n\r\n“Whom would you recommend?” said Kelpie nervously. She felt quite sure\r\nthat she would have to go to the specialist, because the kingfisher had\r\ntold her to do exactly what she always did. She changed her scene, she\r\ndabbled in the water, and she lived on flies and anything she could get\r\nin the brooks.\r\n\r\n“You might consult a crow,” said the kingfisher. “They are the most\r\nhighly developed of all birds, and are nearest to man. There is one who\r\nlives in a wood a mile or two higher up. You can mention my name if you\r\nlike.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you very much,” said Kelpie; “but would you be so very kind as to\r\ntell me what is the matter with me?”\r\n\r\nThe kingfisher sat still for another moment as if in deep reflection;\r\nthen he made a dart downwards into the water, dived, brought up a fish,\r\nand glided with it in his beak round a turn of the stream and\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nKelpie went at once in search of the crow. She felt that whatever came\r\nof it, she must find out what was wrong with her. After a long search\r\nshe found the crow sitting on the dead branch of a hollow old oak-tree.\r\nThe bones of a young rabbit, which he had been dissecting, doubtless\r\nwith a scientific object, lay on the ground below. Kelpie felt very\r\nfrightened when she looked at this huge black bird, with his enormous\r\nblack bill, curved into a sharp hook at the end. But there was no help\r\nfor it; she felt she must go through with it. As she approached, he gave\r\na low hoarse croak.\r\n\r\n“What do you want here?” he said.\r\n\r\n“The kingfisher recommended you, sir,” said Kelpie, “as a--”\r\n\r\n“The kingfisher _recommended me_, did he?” said the crow. “The impudence\r\nof these small practitioners! But never mind the kingfisher: pray go on,\r\nmy time is limited.”\r\n\r\n“I have been greatly troubled,” said the trembling Kelpie, “with a\r\ndesire to find out--”\r\n\r\n“I see,” said the crow decisively. “Yours is a very simple case. What\r\ndid the kingfisher say about it?”\r\n\r\n“He said I was to have change of scene, and cold water, and--”\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” said the crow. “He’s quite wrong. You would certainly have\r\ndied if you hadn’t come to me. You are suffering from a _tumor\r\ninquisitivus esuriens_ of a very virulent kind. I can take it out for\r\nyou.” And he began to sharpen his beak on the bough.\r\n\r\n“Is it a very--a very dangerous operation?” asked Kelpie.\r\n\r\n“One and a half per cent survive it,” said the crow.\r\n\r\n“I think I would rather not have it done,” said Kelpie.\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said the crow; “but you won’t live through the winter. And\r\nif you don’t make haste and go,” he added fiercely, “I’ll do it whether\r\nyou like it or not!”\r\n\r\nKelpie flew away as fast as she could, and never stopped till she was a\r\ngood mile away, and she left that part of the country the very same day.\r\nShe resolved to ask no more questions, but to pass the rest of her life\r\nas well as she could, and die contentedly in the winter. As for foreign\r\ntravel, that was plainly no good now; so she thought she might as well\r\nreturn to the pleasant place where she had been brought up, try and find\r\nsome of her relations, and get a little help and comfort before she\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nSlowly and sadly she made her way towards Oxford. It was now getting\r\ntowards November, and the country was growing sad with falling leaves\r\nand creeping mists; but that was quite in keeping with her own feelings,\r\nand she did not notice the absence of the sun, or feel any sorrow at the\r\nbrowning of the trees and fields; only just one little gleam of sunshine\r\nbrought her a moment’s pleasure, when she saw the spires of Oxford\r\ncatch it in the distance, as she came flitting up the river-bank from\r\nthe point where she had struck the Thames.\r\n\r\nAbout two miles below Oxford she met a boat coming easily down stream,\r\nwith two human beings in it; one was sculling, the other steering. She\r\nstopped on the towing path at a safe distance from them, and waited till\r\nthey should pass. They were within a few yards of her, and she was just\r\ngoing to take flight again, when the one who was steering called out to\r\nthe other in a voice she remembered only too well,\r\n\r\n“Easy a moment, Poet, I want to look at that bird.”\r\n\r\nKelpie stood quite quiet, except that her tail was moving up and down\r\nwith great rapidity. The Poet looked round and saw her.\r\n\r\n“Aha, Chick,” he said (his friend was called Chick because he spent so\r\nmuch time in studying the development of fowls in the egg), “do you\r\nremember that hot afternoon when we lay in the garden and watched the\r\nwagtail? I suppose you’ve found out by this time why they wag their\r\ntails?”\r\n\r\n“No, I haven’t,” said Chick. “Nor have you found out why Shakespeare\r\nwrote no plays the last three years of his life.”\r\n\r\n“Quite true,” said the Poet; “but then I don’t work at the Museum, where\r\nthey find out everything!”\r\n\r\n“No, they don’t,” said Chick; “you’re quite out of it. Spare your irony\r\nfor once. I’ll just tell you what happened that afternoon. I kept\r\nthinking of that bird all the way up to the Museum after I left you, for\r\nwhen I came to think of it, that tail-wagging was rather an interesting\r\npoint. So when I got there, I asked the Professor about it. Well, he was\r\na bit bothered with his specimens that afternoon, and rather short in\r\nhis temper, and I was late, which made him worse; so he gave me a\r\nlecture on the spot. He’s a good lecturer, you know, even when he’s\r\nquite serene: but when he’s savage there’s no one like him. He comes out\r\nwith home-truths then, and blows you into little bits. I wish you would\r\ncome and let him demolish you, Poet, it would knock such a heap of\r\nrubbish out of your poetic head.”\r\n\r\n“Very likely,” said the Poet: “but what nonsense did he knock out of\r\n_your_ head? Plenty there to operate upon.”\r\n\r\n“I quite allow it,” said Chick. “That is a scientific view of education\r\nwhich you poets would do well to act on. But the Professor growled at me\r\nwhen I asked him why wagtails wag their tails, and said there would have\r\nbeen some use in asking _how_ they do it. And then he took me into his\r\nroom, and showed me diagrams, and explained the muscular system of a\r\nbird, which I never understood before; and he kept me a whole hour\r\nthere, till at last he got quite sweet again. And after that he said\r\nhe’d give me a piece of advice, which I’ll hand on to you, and I hope it\r\nwill do you good.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sitting at your feet,” said the Poet, “go on.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what he said was this: ‘You young fellows are a deal too anxious\r\nto get hold of a reason for everything; and I dare say you think it a\r\nfine thing to come and try to puzzle us with questions. Now what you\r\nhave to learn here at present is not reasons, but facts. Leave alone\r\nfor the present these questions that begin with the word _why_; there\r\nare many of them that can never be answered, as far as I can see, or\r\nthey can only be answered by getting together and properly arranging a\r\ngreat quantity of facts. Your wagtail question is just one of this kind.\r\nYou have no more business to be asking me such a question, than a young\r\nwagtail has to be asking its parents why it wags its tail. You stick to\r\nfacts, and don’t ask _why_ a thing is, until you know altogether and\r\nexactly _that_ it is and _how_ it is.’\r\n\r\n“And I’ve been sticking to facts ever since,” added Chick; “and you’d\r\nmuch better do the same. Pull on, Poet; and whenever you see a wagtail\r\nthink of what I’ve told you, and your poetic brain will be all the\r\nbetter for it.”\r\n\r\n“There she goes,” said the Poet: “I wonder why she stopped so long. I\r\nreally think she was listening to us.”\r\n\r\n“I might have spared you the Professor’s sermon,” said Chick. “Pull on,\r\nPoet; go ahead. Here we are running into the bank while you’re asking\r\nquestions that begin with _why_!” And they dropped slowly down the\r\nstream.\r\n\r\nThe Poet was quite right. Kelpie had been listening--drinking in every\r\nword of the Professor’s sermon. A delicious and soothing feeling grew\r\nupon her at each sentence, and when it was over she sprang upon her\r\nwings with a sense that a whole load of trouble had been taken off her\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n“They were all wrong,” she said to herself: “thrush, jackdaw,\r\nkingfisher, and especially that wicked old crow. Why couldn’t they tell\r\nme the truth? But that’s a question that begins with _why_, and I must\r\nstick hard to facts.”\r\n\r\nKelpie kept hard to her facts, and found her happiness in doing so. She\r\nkept to flies, beetles, and small crustaceans; she kept hard to her\r\nhusband when the pairing-time came, and to her eggs and young; she kept\r\nto the laws of her kind, and left the questions that begin with “why” to\r\nthe Professor and his species.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIGHTHOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a wild and gusty day early in April; a wet wind from the\r\nsouth-east drove the waves into a little bay, where the sea had long ago\r\nforced an opening in the great chalk rampart of the coast. The downs\r\nrose steeply above this opening, their short sweet grass freshened by\r\nrain and wind; down below in the hollow a little stream, clear as every\r\nchalk-stream is, trickled through the long grass, still brown with the\r\nsun of last summer, and nestled here and there under a fringe of dwarf\r\nwillows or alders. As it reached the shore, which was a huge bank of\r\nrounded flints from the white cliff, the brook spread itself out for a\r\nlittle space on a stony bed, and played with a few green weeds that had\r\nfastened themselves upon the larger pebbles, then crept quietly into the\r\nflinty bank, and vanished utterly before it lost itself finally in the\r\nsea-waves.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning of that April day you might have seen a tiny bird\r\nfly in from the sea, and settle, more dead than alive, upon the top of\r\nthe bank. Here the strong wind, coming now from behind it, blew up its\r\nfeathers and made it so uncomfortable that in a minute or two it\r\nfluttered down the stones to the wider bit of stream beyond; and then\r\nagain, seeing still better shelter a little further on, it struggled\r\nalong the brook till it reached the first little group of fringing\r\nwillows, and there, close to the water, in a little hollow under the\r\nbank, where the willow-roots were thick and close, and where a turn in\r\nthe brook gave respite from the gusts and rain, it felt itself safe and\r\ntolerably warm, began to preen its feathers, and at last put its head\r\nunder its little brown wing and slept.\r\n\r\nIt was a willow-warbler; olive-brown on head, back, and tail, but with\r\njust a tinge of yellow too; whitish-gray on throat and breast, and with\r\na faint light stripe over the bright hazel eyes. It was very small, not\r\nmore than five inches from point of beak to end of tail; but it had that\r\nnight crossed the sea from France, and in the last few days it had made\r\na journey of some thousand miles from the north of Africa where it had\r\npassed the winter. It had not travelled alone; it had left the coast of\r\nNormandy with a company of tired friends; but in the night the wind rose\r\nhowling in the south-east and scattered the weary but hopeful little\r\nband. Many a time in that trying night it would have sunk upon the waves\r\nif the thought had not ruled its soul of the cool moist and of varied\r\nsunshine and showers, where it had first learned to fly, where the next\r\nsummer it had learnt to use its voice and to woo a mate, and had brought\r\nup its young without disaster. Driven northward by the burning heat of\r\nthe south, which had dried up the streams, and killed the juicy insects\r\nit loved, it had made its way steadily with its comrades to the green\r\nmoist land of its birth, and its heart was full of ardent hope for\r\nanother long summer of love and song and happiness.\r\n\r\nAfter a while the clouds passed and the sun came out; then the little\r\nbird woke up, and realized that it had eaten nothing since it left the\r\ncoast of France. In a moment it was stealing up the willow, searching\r\nevery twig for insects, and finding very few, for the pelting rain had\r\nwashed the boughs clean; it made its way slowly up the brook, and\r\npresently coming to a bit of treeless marsh land, whence the stream was\r\nfed, it took a longer flight across a ploughed field, and stopped at a\r\nlikely-looking spot--a small round pond, closely shut in by willows and\r\nhazels. Hardly had it alighted on one of these, when it recognized the\r\nfaint voice of a bird of its own kind, and returned the single cheep by\r\nanother like it. In a moment the two birds were together, and recognized\r\neach other as having been in company all the way from Africa, until the\r\nstorm separated them at sea.\r\n\r\n“I’m very glad to see you,” said our friend; “but where are the others,\r\nand how did you come here?”\r\n\r\nJust then it saw an insect on a twig hard by, and went off in an\r\ninstant to seize it; then another and another; and in its hunger forgot\r\nall about the answer to its question.\r\n\r\n“Well, you had better catch your fill of insects, and then I can answer\r\nyour questions,” said the other. “I have been here ever since the sun\r\ncame out, and though I thought I could hardly have eaten anything after\r\nthe loss of poor Pipi, I managed to make a good meal as soon as I got my\r\nfeathers in order.”\r\n\r\n“The loss of poor Pipi! What _do_ you mean? Is he only lost or is he\r\ndead?”\r\n\r\n“Dead as a thrush’s snail!” was the answer of the other bird, who seemed\r\na little put out by his long journey. “I’m very sorry of course, but it\r\nwas all his own fault. You know how Pipi was always ready for any game;\r\nalways for prying and poking his beak into anything strange, just like\r\nany vulgar sparrow.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t talk like that, please,” said our friend whose name was Flip.\r\n“Pipi was my particular friend and if you insult him you insult me.”\r\n\r\n“Well, don’t get angry,” said the other, “but wait till I tell you how\r\nthat foolish Pipi came by his end. We started, as you know, at\r\nnightfall; Pipi was near me. He was as lively as ever, and was making\r\nfun of old Blossom because he had only half his tail feathers--you\r\nremember that sunny garden by the Mediterranean, where the cat got hold\r\nof Blossom and we thought his last hour had come?--Blossom couldn’t fly\r\nquite straight, and Pipi, that mischievous Pipi, said he wondered what\r\nsort of a _tale_ Blossom would have to tell when he got to land!”\r\n\r\n“But he helped on old Blossom, too,” said Flip; “and don’t you remember\r\nhow we all had to slacken pace halfway across, before the storm came on,\r\nin order not to leave the old creature behind? Pipi would have it so!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I do indeed,” said Twinkle; “and it was a mercy that we ever got\r\nhere alive. I should like to know why we should risk our lives for old\r\nBlossom, or why we should obey Pipi--Pipi of all birds.”\r\n\r\n“Come,” said Flip, “don’t be so crusty. You have no cause to be angry\r\nwith Pipi. I remember very well, when we were among those cruel\r\nItalians, how Pipi saved your life: I saw it with my own eyes. You were\r\nin an olive-tree by a stone wall, and on the top of the wall sat a boy\r\nwith a bow and arrows, aiming at you; Pipi gave you our alarm-note, and\r\nwhen you took no notice he flew right at you and made you move. The boy\r\nshot the arrow, but seeing two birds he luckily missed both.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Twinkle, “didn’t I say I could hardly eat because of Pipi’s\r\ndeath? Now I am going to tell how it was. You know how even in our first\r\njourney we were specially warned about those lighthouses, which we\r\nalways so much want to go to: I really don’t know how it is, but somehow\r\none does want dreadfully to go and see what that light is. Pipi was\r\nalways excited about it; he declared he would find out some day what\r\nthey are, and now he has found out with a vengeance. Poor old Pipi! He\r\nand I and one or two more were together the greater part of the way, but\r\nit was very hard to stick to one another. We had better have put off our\r\ncrossing a day or two. The wind changed to the south-east, and that is\r\nvery disagreeable; it comes behind you, and forces you on whether you\r\nwill or no, and it gets in among the feathers and ruffles them about,\r\nand lays bare your skin, and blows the breath out of your body, and\r\nbangs you about this way and that--I can feel it now,” said Twinkle, in\r\nan injured tone, as he turned round his head and smoothed his feathers\r\nwith an air of great feeling and commiseration for himself.\r\n\r\n“Now I didn’t ask him to tell about himself,” thought Flip. “Here he is\r\nsafe and sound anyhow.” But he held his tongue, and Twinkle went on:--\r\n\r\n“After we had got half-way across, a sudden blast of wind broke up our\r\ncompany, and for some time I was quite alone in the darkness. Every now\r\nand then I could hear the voices of our comrades, and they must have\r\nbeen close to me, for the wind howled so, that it would have been\r\nimpossible to catch them at any distance. I was high up, as we all had\r\nbeen, but now it began to rain, and I flew lower down, to see if there\r\nwas any island or object on which I could rest and get shelter; but that\r\nwas hard work, I can tell you, for the wind seemed to come from below\r\nwhenever I opened my wings wide, and gave me such a lifting that I was\r\nquite giddy.”\r\n\r\n“Go on, please,” said Flip, as the other paused again to recall his own\r\ndiscomfort. Flip felt much inclined to make unpleasant remarks, but\r\nswallowed them down with a juicy green fly, which he found at that\r\nmoment. All this time they had been quietly working about the willows,\r\nand eating what they found; for willow-warblers are seldom still, and\r\ncan talk very well as they search for their food.\r\n\r\n“Well, don’t be in too great a hurry,” said Twinkle. “Consider what\r\nself-denial it is to me to tell you such a story: it’s nearly as bad as\r\ngoing through it all again. When I succeeded in getting lower down, and\r\ncould see the white foam of the waves, I suddenly saw a light below me,\r\nand a little in front, twinkling like a great hawk’s eye, and--”\r\n\r\n“The lighthouse!” cried Flip, with a pang, for he felt sure that the\r\nworst part of the story was coming.\r\n\r\n“No, not the lighthouse,” said Twinkle. “Don’t interrupt. You’re a most\r\nunpleasant bird to tell a story to, stopping one just in the most\r\nexciting part: it quite spoils the pleasure of story-telling.”\r\n\r\n“Why, I thought--” Flip was going to have reminded him that it was such\r\n_self-denial_, but he thought better of it, and swallowed his impatience\r\nwith another fly.\r\n\r\n“And down I went,” continued Twinkle, “to get a rest; for where there is\r\na light, there must be something to perch on. Well, in a minute or two I\r\nfound myself clinging with all the strength of my poor claws--” (here he\r\nlooked at them compassionately for a moment, and gave them a peck or two\r\nwith his bill, to clear away some tiny particles of salt that still\r\nadhered to them).\r\n\r\nFlip could hardly help making an angry dash at him, and indeed ruffled\r\nhis feathers indignantly, but the other was too much occupied with\r\nhimself to see it.\r\n\r\n“Clinging with my poor claws,” said Twinkle, slowly and sadly, “to the\r\nrigging of a ship, and trying to get my breath. I hadn’t been there very\r\nlong, when I heard a voice I knew, and who should seize hold of the\r\nsame rope but Pipi himself!”\r\n\r\n“Was Pipi very bad and tired too?” asked Flip.\r\n\r\n“Not a bit,” was the answer. “I never knew such a bird as Pipi. Of\r\ncourse I pointed out to him that we were in great danger, and that we\r\ncouldn’t hope to hold out much longer--and what do you think he said?\r\n‘Twinkle,’ he said, ‘think of your first nest last year. Don’t you\r\nremember those sunny days in the meadow by the brook, and the excitement\r\nas the hatching days drew near?’ Can you imagine such folly as to talk\r\nof hatching when we were sitting in a place like that, hardly able to\r\nhold on for the wind?”\r\n\r\nFlip thought he knew why Pipi had said that, but he did not interrupt\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\n“Well,” continued Twinkle, “he went on like that, and told me to cheer\r\nup, and said we couldn’t be far from land, for the ship was only a\r\nfishing-smack caught in a storm, and they never venture very far from\r\nshore; and at last I got very angry with such nonsense, and told him\r\nnothing should make me leave go except the wind. So Pipi declared at\r\nlast that he was going on, and I had better come too; but I wouldn’t, so\r\nhe opened his wings, and just as he left the rope, somehow or other I\r\ndid so too.”\r\n\r\n“Why,” said Flip, unable to suppress himself this time. “I thought you\r\nsaid Pipi was the last bird in the world you would obey!”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t obey Pipi,” said Twinkle, indignantly. “I went of myself.”\r\n\r\nBut Flip knew better, for Pipi had a wonderful influence over the other\r\nbirds, and they all knew that Twinkle in particular could always be led\r\nby him.\r\n\r\n“Well, there we were again at the mercy of this horrible south-easter.\r\nPipi was a little ahead of me, and kept up his call-note continuously: I\r\nkept on answering it as well as I could. We had not been flying long,\r\nwhen suddenly, at no great distance, a light burst out in the darkness.\r\n‘Land and the lighthouse!’ called out Pipi, and on we went at a\r\ntremendous speed, for the gale was now almost behind us, roaring\r\nfuriously. In another moment the light went out as suddenly as it had\r\nbegun, and then I knew that it was one of those revolving lights that we\r\nhave sometimes seen in our travels, and I guessed that it was that one\r\non the headland yonder, where we arrived a year ago, that beautiful calm\r\nnight with the gentle westerly breeze.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear, dear!” said Flip, “I remember that it puzzled Pipi dreadfully\r\nthat night, and he declared he would find out all about it some day.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Twinkle, “his wish has been gratified this year. I was\r\nalmost too faint and tired to fly any farther, and my pace had\r\nslackened, so that Pipi was some way in front, when out came the light\r\nagain, a great deal bigger than before, and just ahead of us. As I\r\nreached it, and was sinking down on the land exhausted, I saw Pipi fly\r\nright up to it, and heard a loud tap of his bill against something hard;\r\nand then he fell down on the balustrade in front of the light, and there\r\nhe lay, as dead as a thrush’s snail, as I said before.”\r\n\r\nFlip was silent, and put his head under his wing to hide his grief. “Did\r\nyou go and look at him?” he said at last.\r\n\r\n“How can you ask such a question?” answered Twinkle. “I sank to the\r\nground, and got into some long grass under a bit of hedge by the\r\nlighthouse. I hadn’t strength left to take wing again; and if I could\r\nhave done it, I should have been blown against the lighthouse: and what\r\nwas more, the light had gone out again, and I couldn’t see where it\r\nwas.”\r\n\r\n“But the light came out once more, I suppose?” asked Flip.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” said the other. “I put my head under my wing and went to\r\nsleep under the hedge; which is exactly what you too would have done, if\r\nyou had been there.”\r\n\r\nFlip said no more; but he formed a strong opinion about Twinkle, and\r\nfelt that he did not care for his company any longer. Watching his\r\nopportunity, while the other was at work on a fly, he flitted quietly\r\ninto the thick of the alders on the other side of the round pond, and\r\ntaking a perch right down in the roots by the water, began to give vent\r\nto his own sorrow by uttering a sad cheep every minute or two. Poor\r\nPipi, the kindest and the cleverest of them all! always helping some\r\none, and always in good humour! never without some little fun of his\r\nown, even in the most awkward moments! How could they possibly get back\r\nagain to Africa, when the summer was over, without Pipi? How indeed\r\nwould Flip have the heart to sing to his wife during the nesting-time,\r\nunless Pipi’s voice was heard from the next tree? Pipi was always\r\nsinging, and his voice was the best of all: for while the others were\r\nalways finding their voices go up with a turn at the end of their\r\nstrain, like those commonplace chaffinches, Pipi almost always brought\r\ndown his in a perfect cadence, which is the great accomplishment of a\r\nwillow-warbler. And when the young were fledged, no young father of a\r\nbrood was so careful or so beloved as Pipi. _He_ did not leave all the\r\nwork to his wife, as some did; Mrs. Pipi had been hard-worked ever since\r\nthey built their nest at the foot of the big elm-tree, and now she was\r\nsent off every day in the early morning to eat her fill of insects in a\r\nneighbouring garden, with a special warning to beware of the old gray\r\ncat, who was always creeping about between the pea-rows. Then Pipi used\r\nto take the young ones under his own charge, and put off his own\r\nbreakfast till he had fed them well, popping the food into their gaping\r\nbeaks as fast as if his wife had been there to help him. What fun he\r\nused to make of them! Flip remembered how he was once sitting on a\r\nbough, singing to his own wife, who had not yet hatched all her eggs,\r\nwhen he saw Pipi trying to entice his young ones out of the nest. They\r\nall came out at last, except Dot the youngest, who sat at the door of\r\nthe nest, and looked through the buttercup stems into the wide world\r\nwith fearful and restless eyes. Pipi tried all he could to make her come\r\nout; he perched on the bough above her and sang his best, so that her\r\nlittle black eyes twinkled, for she knew that music well; but still she\r\nhesitated. Then he picked up a little green caterpillar and put it down\r\njust in front of her; her bill opened wide at the sight of such a juicy\r\nmorsel, but still she did not come. Just then a snail came slowly by,\r\nwith its shell on its back.\r\n\r\n“Dot,” said Pipi, “do you see that creature with his nest on his back?\r\nShall I tell you why he must always carry it? When he was a nestling, he\r\nwouldn’t come out of his nest like the others; so at last the nest stuck\r\nto him, and he carries it to this day, and always will. So take care the\r\nsame thing doesn’t happen to you, Dot--I rather think I see your back\r\nbeginning to stick to that bit of moss; and if you don’t make haste--”\r\nBut before he could finish the sentence, the horror-stricken Dot was out\r\nof the nest; and in another minute she was on a twig beside him.\r\n\r\nRecollections like these passed through poor Flip’s clouded mind, as he\r\nlurked in the stems of the alder-root. But after a while, as the wind\r\nwent down, he bestirred himself, and flying up to the top of the alder,\r\nbegan to look about him. There was the sea, and there the little gap,\r\nwith the stream, where he had landed: and there, right above it, on a\r\nheadland, was the lighthouse. It would not take long to get there, and\r\nhe felt that he must go and find out if anything was to be seen of poor\r\nPipi. A flight would do him good, and there were plenty of hedges to\r\nrest on. So after a number of quick low flights from hedge to hedge and\r\ntree to tree, he came to the front of the lighthouse, and sank rather\r\ntired into the long grass where Twinkle had landed in the night. Peeping\r\nout after a while, he flew about a little, searching for poor Pipi’s\r\nbody: but nothing was to be seen of it. Then, taking courage, he flew up\r\non to the platform in front of the light, on which Twinkle had described\r\nPipi’s falling, but neither here was there a trace to be seen of Pipi.\r\n\r\nJust as he was going to fly off he heard a voice inside the\r\nlantern-room, and listened, for birds can understand all languages.\r\n\r\n“Well, Peter,” said the voice, “what did you get in last night’s gale?\r\nThe warblers ought to be coming now; we have had the chiffchaffs and the\r\nwheatears, and a few redstarts; who are the next earliest this year?”\r\n\r\nFlip peeped in at a corner of the window; it was dangerous, but he might\r\nsee or hear something of Pipi. The man who had spoken was a tall, hale,\r\nand hearty looking old gentleman, with a face glowing with its own\r\ngood-nature as well as with the blustering of the gale. He was answered\r\nby the lighthouse-man, who wore an oilskin hat, and was short and\r\nweather-beaten.\r\n\r\n“Good afternoon, Professor,” he said, as he put his hand into a deep\r\npocket of his overcoat, “I’ve a thing or two for you this time; sure to\r\nget something in a gale like that, though for the matter of that a calm\r\nnight suits ’em better. We’ll have more to-night again, I’ll answer for\r\nit. Here they be: some of ’em knocked agen the window and fell on the\r\nplatform (Flip felt his ears tingling and his brain swimming); some on\r\n‘em were blowed right away and we couldn’t find ’em. Wrens we calls ’em\r\nhere, though they ben’t just like our jenny wrens, all the same,” said\r\nhe, as he pulled out a number of little birds and laid them on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nFlip shuddered; he recognized his kindred, but their eyes were closed,\r\ntheir heads hung down, and their feathers lay loose and heavy: there was\r\nno telling one from another, especially at his distance from the table.\r\nStill, he had no doubt in his mind that Pipi was among them.\r\n\r\n“Willow-wrens, if you like,” said the Professor; “willow-warblers, I\r\nlike to call them; _Phylloscopus trochilus_ is the scientific name, and\r\nyou will find all about them in that book of mine I gave you, at page\r\n432. A redstart too, I see, poor fellow; so much the worse for\r\nsomebody’s garden or field this next May or June. But now, where’s the\r\ndiary; let us have them all down--wind, what was it, south-east by\r\nsouth?”\r\n\r\n“That’s it, sir,” said the lighthouse-man; and they sat down together at\r\nthe table, and began to turn the birds over one by one. Flip watched\r\ntill they came to the last, in the dim expectation of recognizing Pipi;\r\nbut it was impossible, for the dead eyes showed no traces of their\r\nluckless owner’s identity. It was a mournful scene, and Flip was just\r\nabout to take flight, when he heard Peter’s voice again.\r\n\r\n“There be another on ’em down stairs, Professor,” he said; “he were only\r\nstunned like, and my missus said as she’d keep un a bit, and see if he’d\r\ncome to life again.”\r\n\r\nFlip’s feathers stood on end with excitement.\r\n\r\n“Missus,” called out Peter, putting his head out of the door, “what ha’\r\nyou done with that bit of a wren as I give you this marnin’?”\r\n\r\n“Putten him in the old canary cage, and given him some crumbs and milk,”\r\nsaid the wife from below; “but he won’t touch neither of ’em, and he’s\r\nas bad as can be. Ask the Professor gentleman if he’ll come down and see\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nThereupon the Professor and Peter went down stairs, and Flip could hear\r\nno more. He felt sick at heart. Even if this was Pipi, it was clear\r\nenough he was going to die. If he got nothing better than crumbs and\r\nmilk, how in the name of all that’s feathered was he going to live?\r\n“What stupid creatures these men-folks are!” thought Flip; and perhaps\r\nhe was not far wrong. But he did not know what a professor meant, and he\r\nwas not aware that the genial old gentleman from the distant University\r\nknew almost as much about the food of willow-warblers as he did himself.\r\n\r\nFlip flew round to the back of the lighthouse, and looking in through\r\nthe window, he saw the Professor sitting by the fire with something in\r\nhis hand. But his back was turned to the window, and Flip could not see\r\nwhat it was. The woman was looking over the Professor’s shoulder, and a\r\nsmall bird-cage stood on the table, the sight of which made Flip tremble\r\nall over. At last the Professor put down on the table the thing he had\r\nin his hand: it was a willow-warbler, still alive, for the beak was\r\nslowly opening and shutting; but the eyes were closed, and it was\r\nevidently dying. Flip could not tell whether or no it were Pipi; the\r\nroom was now getting dark, and the window was away from the sun. But it\r\nwas no use waiting any longer; Flip felt sure the bird must die, and\r\neven if it did not, it would be put into the cage to pine away for want\r\nof air and proper food; and after all, how was he to tell that Pipi was\r\nnot among the dead birds up stairs? So he flew away with an aching\r\nheart, feeling that there was nothing left to do, but to try and forget\r\nall about it. “And yet,” thought poor Flip, as he reached the little\r\npond once more, “I can try and remember what poor Pipi used to do, and\r\nhow good-natured and cheerful he was; and so far as there ever can be\r\nanother Pipi, I will be he.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe willow-warblers do not all take flight together to their inland\r\nhaunts after their arrival from the sea, but work their way gradually\r\nthrough woods and hedges, refreshing and strengthening themselves as\r\nthey go. The party to which Flip and Twinkle belonged had not far to go\r\nto get to the meadow by the brook, of which Pipi had reminded Twinkle on\r\nthe fishing-smack--the meadow where they themselves had reared their\r\nbrood last year, and close to another, not less delicious, where they\r\nthemselves had been born. In two or three days they had reached it, and\r\nsoon began to exercise their voices, so as to be ready for the arrival\r\nof the hen birds, who always come a few days later. This year the\r\nweather continued cold and stormy, with strong April showers, and the\r\nhens did not come for a day or two later than usual. What excitement\r\nthere was when they arrived at last, straggling in by twos and threes\r\nalong the bushes that grew by the brook’s edge, so as to keep sheltered\r\nfrom the wind! Flip went down the willows to meet them, and asked each\r\none whether she had come by the lighthouse, or seen anything of Pipi;\r\nbut the hens were either too tired or too excited to pay much attention\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n“That is not the way to welcome us,” they said; “accidents must happen,\r\nand must be forgotten. No, we saw nothing of Pipi. Why don’t you sing,\r\ninstead of telling us sad tales?” And on they went into the meadow,\r\nwhere the songs of the cock birds were calling them.\r\n\r\nOne well-known song was missing from the tall elm by the brook-side; and\r\nFlip, in spite of his excitement in singing, and his hopes that his\r\ncourtship might be successful with a certain little brown member of a\r\nlast year’s brood, could not help thinking now and then, with a heavy\r\nheart, of Pipi the best of singers, and of all the happiness they might\r\nhave had but for that unlucky lighthouse. Twinkle too would sometimes\r\nremind him of his sorrow in\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pipi looked up and saw Flip; in an instant they were\r\ntogether.--P. 205.]\r\n\r\nhis blunt and selfish way, and Flip felt his company still so unpleasant\r\nthat he moved to a tree further up the brook.\r\n\r\nOne day, not long after the arrival of the hens, when Flip had made sure\r\nof his little spouse, and they were flying after one another from tree\r\nto tree round the field, then into another field and another, in loving\r\nchase, Flip caught a low song that made him stop instantly and perch. It\r\nsounded again from a low willow, and then Flip could see the singer\r\nmoving about inside the tree, where the leaves were just beginning to\r\nappear. In another moment a willow-warbler fluttered out; its flight was\r\nfeeble, and as it perched again, Flip could see that it held on with\r\nsome difficulty to the twig, for its right leg was injured. But it was\r\nPipi!\r\n\r\nYes, it was Pipi beyond all doubt; and Flip, glued to his bough by\r\namazement, gave out such a strain of song as he had never in his whole\r\nlife before been able to produce. Pipi looked up and saw Flip; in an\r\ninstant they were together, and in such a state of tremor and delight,\r\nthat poor Mrs. Flip was left quite out in the cold, and became for the\r\nfirst time in her life jealous of a cock bird.\r\n\r\n“Never mind me,” said Pipi at last; “look at me, Mrs. Flip, a poor\r\nwreck, with a bruised bill, and a game leg, and only half a song: who\r\ncould be jealous of me? Leave off fluttering round poor Flip, and let me\r\ntell him my story, and then you shall have him all to yourself.”\r\n\r\nSo Mrs. Flip perched quietly on a bough hard by, for she was a sensible\r\nbird, or she would not have married Flip; and she had so often heard him\r\ntalk of Pipi that she felt he must want sadly to hear the story.\r\n\r\nThen Pipi told how he had suddenly come upon the light, and then lost\r\nall his senses as suddenly; how, when he came to himself, he was in a\r\nhorrible cage, with nothing fit to eat, even if he could have eaten it;\r\nhow the Professor had taken him in his hand and stroked him softly, and\r\nthen had bound up his leg without hurting him a bit; how he had told\r\nPeter’s wife to keep Pipi warm, and to get some insects off the trees\r\nfor him if he got any better. And then how he felt the warmth slowly\r\nreviving the life within him, and how he began to flutter a little\r\nabout the room, and was very nearly caught by the cat, and then put into\r\nthe cage out of her reach; how Peter brought a great piece of\r\nwillow-bough, as the Professor had told him, on which Pipi had contrived\r\nto find a few insects; and how, as strength returned, a great desire\r\ngrew within him to get away to the meadow and the brook, and he\r\nfluttered so much that his feathers began to fall out, and he could take\r\nno more food. And lastly, how Peter’s good wife had taken the cage into\r\nthe garden and opened the door, and how he had made his way, slowly and\r\nwearily, to the old summer home.\r\n\r\n“And now you know all about it,” he said, and sang one strain with\r\nsomething like the old force. “Let us go and find old Blossom,” said he,\r\n“and see if his _tale_ is equal to mine. And Twinkle too--poor grumpy\r\nTwinkle; I shall never be able to hold up my head before him any more,\r\nand he will be more unpleasant than ever. But after all,” he went on\r\nafter a moment, “Twinkle was my only companion that dreadful night, and\r\nhe is not such a bad bird after all, and is sure to be glad to see me.\r\nAnd let me tell you,” he added, in a serious voice, “that I intend to\r\nvisit that kind lighthouse-woman again, and the Professor too, if I can\r\nfind him; for I have found out one thing in the lighthouse, and that is,\r\nthat though men are often cruel to us birds, they are not all so; and\r\nthough they must, most of them, know very little about us, there are a\r\nfew at least who understand our ways.”\r\n\r\nPipi soon regained his strength, his song, and his spirits; he found a\r\nwife, and when his young ones were old enough to understand, he told\r\nthem many stories of his wonderful adventures. And he did not forget to\r\ngo and see Peter and his wife in the autumn, when the birds were on\r\ntheir way once more to the south. He came into the garden, and from the\r\nstunted currant-tree on the wall he looked into the kitchen, and uttered\r\na little low note of greeting. The woman looked up from her washing, saw\r\nPipi, and uttered a cry of delight. “Peter!” she called, “it is the sick\r\nbird! Come quick and see!” But Pipi could not stay for Peter, and the\r\ncage, still standing on the dresser, made him even now feel a little\r\nuncomfortable. His voice, like that of all his comrades, had been almost\r\nsilent for several weeks; but as a gleam of autumn sunshine shot into\r\nthe garden, and lit up the hardy little double daisies that still\r\ncontrived to bloom in that bleak spot, he called up all his strength,\r\nand uttered a single strain, the faint echo of his old spring song,\r\nbefore he flew away. It went straight to the good woman’s heart, and she\r\nnever forgot it.\r\n\r\n“Peter,” she said, as the lighthouse-man came into the kitchen, “don’t\r\nforget to tell the Professor gentleman that the little bird came back to\r\nthank him and us. And, Peter, don’t you ever go for to keep any more\r\nbirds in cages, when you can have ’em sing to you out o’ doors; for the\r\nblessed creatures are worth better than that, and there’s human beings\r\nas might take a lesson from ’em.” And those kind eyes of hers were moist\r\nas she went on with her washing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OWLS’ REVENGE.\r\n\r\n(A TALE OF BIRDS AND MEN.)\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nIn May all woods are beautiful; but of all the woods I know, there is\r\nnone on which the month of bluebells so freely lavishes her delights, as\r\non the ancient and unkempt wood of Truerne. The blue carpet spread in\r\nevery clearing, the gray-green oak-stems rising softly out of the blue,\r\nthe fleecy clouds of spring, seen gently moving eastwards through the\r\nruddy young leaves overhead, can never be forgotten by any one who has\r\nrambled here for a whole May-morning. No trim park-paling shuts in\r\nTruerne wood; its outskirts are set about, in these sweet spring days,\r\nwith an untidy maze of “whitening hedges and uncrumpling fern,” with\r\nstretches of gorse and trailing bramble, with dense thickets of\r\nblackthorn where the nightingale builds his nest and sings unheeded. It\r\nis all this wild setting of the woodland, as well as the freedom of the\r\nwood itself, that makes it so dear to such of its human neighbours as\r\nlove quiet and solitude, as well as to the birds and beasts that find\r\nhome and happiness in its shelter.\r\n\r\nOf the few human beings who haunted it a few years ago, old Oliver the\r\nwoodman was the only one to whom it had wholly yielded up its secrets;\r\nand when one day he was found under his favourite old oak-tree, wrapped\r\nin a slumber from which there was no awakening, we felt that the good\r\ngenius of the wood had vanished, leaving no successor. But on the\r\nmorning of that 16th day of May on which my story begins and ends, old\r\nOliver was still vigorous, and had risen at daybreak in order to finish\r\nhis work early. He meant to set forward about midday for the\r\nneighbouring town on the hill; for it was fairday, or “club” as we call\r\nit in these parts, at Northstow, and he wished once more to buy a\r\nfairing for the rheumatic old wife sitting by the chimney-corner at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nHe is sitting, and eating his dinner, at the foot of his favourite oak,\r\nwhich is separated by a few yards of bluebells and undergrowth from one\r\nof the grassy rides, or “lights” (as we call them) which intersect the\r\nwood, and let sunshine and fresh air into its tangled depths. It is his\r\nfavourite tree, partly because its gray-lichened stem divides on one\r\nside, as it nears the ground, into two big root-branches which leave a\r\ncomfortable space between them--a mossy arm-chair of which he only knows\r\nthe comfort who has toiled since daybreak without ceasing; and partly\r\nbecause the tree is old, as old as the abbey of Truerne which once stood\r\nunder the shadow of the wood in the meadows below; and because it is\r\nhollow enough to be the home of a family of brown owls, whose ancestors\r\nhad been tenants of the wood long before the monks became its owners.\r\nThese owls were some of Oliver’s best friends; he seldom saw them, nor\r\nthey him; but, boy and man, he had known them for more than half a\r\ncentury, and knew them well to be discreet and quiet creatures, who did\r\nno harm and gave no trouble to any one but vermin. There was\r\n\r\n[Illustration: He is sitting and eating his dinner at the foot of his\r\nfavourite oak.--P. 212.]\r\n\r\na silent, mysterious sageness about their ways, which suited well with\r\nthe old man’s humour.\r\n\r\nAs he sat there eating and resting, the silence of the wood was broken\r\nby the sudden squeak of a pig; and half turning his face in the\r\ndirection of the ride, Oliver saw an uplifted sapling descend on the\r\nback of the squeaker, who raised his piteous voice again, and rushed\r\nonwards down the path with his companions. They were followed by the\r\nowner of the sapling, a tall man in a long greasy coat of a yellowish\r\ncolour; his face was fat and ruddy, and out of it there looked two small\r\ncunning eyes, which followed the movements of his pigs to right and left\r\nwith merciless swiftness. It was the kind of face which men seem to\r\nacquire who spend their lives in driving pigs and driving bargains, and\r\nwho are ever bullying animals and browbeating their fellow-men. Close at\r\nhis heels was another smaller man, a little wizened, discontented\r\nfarmer, whom Mr. Pogson, with his natural imperativeness, had pressed\r\ninto his service in driving his pigs to Northstow fair. An umbrella, as\r\ndecrepit as the farmer himself, was the weapon he used, without much\r\nenergy, when a pig chanced to stray in his direction.\r\n\r\nOliver kept very quiet as they passed: he did not like Pogson, and had\r\nno respect for Weekes the little farmer. At last they had disappeared\r\ndown the ride, and after sitting a while longer, listening to the\r\nsibilant notes of the wood-wren overhead, and watching the squirrels and\r\nthe nuthatches who were fellow-owners of the tree opposite to him, he\r\nrose with something of a sigh,--for he was unwilling to exchange the\r\nquiet wood for the noise and worry of the fair,--and stepped into the\r\nbridle-path to set out on his walk.\r\n\r\n“Are ye ganging to the fair, Oliver, ye lonesome auld dog?” said a grave\r\nbut friendly voice in a Scotch accent. It was the voice of Mr. McNab the\r\nkeeper, who without his gun, and in his best velveteen, was on his way\r\nto look out for a spaniel-puppy or two to fill vacant places.\r\n\r\n“Ay,” said Oliver simply, and they walked on side by side; Mr. McNab’s\r\nserious gray eyes glancing here and there through the wood, and Oliver’s\r\nearnest and rather wistful gaze kept steadily on the bluebells at his\r\nfeet, as was his wont when walking. Neither of them was a man of many\r\nwords or many friends; nor had they spoken to each other half a dozen\r\ntimes a year since the Scotchman came into the neighbourhood. Yet each\r\nof them felt, as they went along, that he had a reasonable man beside\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nIt was high tide at Northstow fair: the broad, sloping street was\r\ncrowded with pens of sheep and pigs, and resounded with the noises of\r\noppressed animals, with the loud voices of their tyrants, and with the\r\nhideous braying of the organs which of late years have added new\r\nattractions to the merry-go-rounds. Old Oliver, soon wearied of the\r\ncrowd and the hubbub, had bought his wife’s new shawl early, and was\r\nabout to turn his steps homewards, when it occurred to him that it would\r\nbe as well, if circumstances were favourable, to get a comfortable shave\r\nbefore leaving.\r\n\r\nThe Northstow barber had a double shop, one window of which was\r\ndecorated with his own wigs and perfumery, while the other showed caps\r\nand bonnets, and was the domain of the milliner, his wife. As Oliver\r\npassed this latter window, and was about to step into the shop, his eye\r\ncaught the well-known form of an owl--a young one, perched in an uneasy\r\nattitude on a lady’s hat. He stopped to look at it, and then discovered\r\na placard, conspicuously placed just underneath the hat, and bearing the\r\nfollowing inscription:\r\n\r\n                   Wanted at once, by a London firm,\r\n                 ONE THOUSAND OWLS![7]\r\n\r\nThe old fellow stood rooted to the pavement, spelling out this placard\r\nagain and again. What could it mean? and what the owlet on the lady’s\r\nhat? As he lingered, two men came up behind him, and there jarred\r\nsuddenly on his senses the bud coarse voice of Mr. Pogson, already a\r\nlittle thickened by frequent glasses of ale and brandy. “Wanted, one\r\nthousand howls!” spelt out Mr. Pogson, slowly. “How much a-piece, now?\r\nThere be scores on ’em in Truerne, be’nt there, Oliver, eh?”\r\n\r\n“Ay, there be brown uns in the wood, and white uns in my barn, and in\r\nHighfield church tower,” said the feeble voice of Mr. Weekes the farmer.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the barber, relieved for a moment from his duties, came\r\nout on his doorstep to enjoy the cheering sights and sounds of the fair.\r\n\r\n“Good day, Mr. Pogson,” he said. “How’s the pigs? Coming in for a shave?\r\nLow prices in pigs to-day, so I hear tell. Ah, you’re looking at the\r\nnotice? My wife brought it down from town yesterday. There’s a chance\r\nfor making money now!”\r\n\r\n“What do they want ’em for?” said Mr. Weekes.\r\n\r\n“What do they give for ’em, you mean,” said Mr. Pogson with some\r\ncontempt.\r\n\r\n“What do they want ’em for?” answered the barber, shirking Mr. Pogson’s\r\nquestion. “Why you haven’t got any pretty daughters, Mr. Weekes, or\r\nyou’d know that by this time. Look at that there owl on the bonnet! Why,\r\nbless you, ’tis all birds now with the ladies in London--and in the\r\ncountry too for the matter o’ that. Birds on their hats, and birds on\r\ntheir dresses; and a very pretty taste too, in my opinion. What’s\r\nprettier, now, than birds? Think of their songs, Mr. Pogson, and all\r\ntheir pretty ways! Why when you sees ’em a fluttering about on the\r\nladies’ hats in town, you could a’most believe as you was out in the\r\ncountry seeing the little creeters a-flying round you and singing! And\r\nnow it’s all owls, I take it. Such softness o’ feathers, you see, such\r\nwings, such----”\r\n\r\n“But what’ll they pay for ’em?” asked Pogson impatiently, tired of the\r\nbarber’s talk.\r\n\r\n“Fancy prices, sir, fancy prices,” said the barber; “why there’s a\r\nfortun’ in that placard! There’s birds o’ paradise selling in town--so\r\nmy wife tells me--for fifty guineas a-piece, and there’s kingfishers and\r\nwoodpeckers fetching a mint o’ money. I tell you even blackbirds and\r\nsuch like brings in something, for they dodges ’em up with other birds’\r\nwings, or dyes ’em red and green, as pretty as can be. And now here’s a\r\nrun on owls, you see; can’t get enough of ’em. Half-a-sovereign a-piece\r\nfor the best ones, I think it was she told me. If pigs is down, Mr.\r\nPogson, why owls is up, you see. Want a shave then? Come along,\r\ngentlemen, I’m free.”\r\n\r\n“There be scores on ’em in Truerne wood,” said the pigdealer again to\r\nWeekes, as he preceded him into the shop; but catching sight of Oliver,\r\nwho had shrunk away from the pair, and stood at a little distance\r\nriveted by the barber’s speech, Mr. Pogson added, “There’s that old tree\r\nby the ride: Oliver’s armchair, the Highfield folks calls it; there’s\r\nowls there now, and young ’uns as well, I’ll be bound. Ain’t there now,\r\nold soft-head?” And he made a playful cut at Oliver with his sapling as\r\nhe went up the steps.\r\n\r\nThe old man was seriously alarmed. That these two men would be ready to\r\nmeddle in the wood for the sake of a few guineas, or even a few\r\nshillings, if they had the chance, he knew very well; and the fact of\r\nthe placard being there on fair-day was quite enough to set all the\r\ngun-owners in the neighbourhood owl-hunting. As he turned away from the\r\nwindow, he caught sight of the tall form of Mr. McNab sauntering through\r\nthe fair, and regarding its various follies much as a grown-up man looks\r\nat the frolic of a pack of children just let out of school. He went\r\nafter him quickly, and touched him on the arm.\r\n\r\n“Mr. McNab! Mr. McNab!” said he, with earnest and imploring eyes,\r\n“there’s mischief up there; there’s mischief in the barber’s shop.\r\nThere’s a placard out for a thousand owls, and they’re going to shoot\r\n‘em in Truerne wood!”\r\n\r\n“They might do waur,” said the keeper, not at all taken aback.\r\n\r\n“‘Tis hard as Lunnon folk can’t leave us alone,” continued Oliver with a\r\nrueful face. “They’ll cut the wood down next and burn it for charcoal;\r\nI’ve heard talk on it afore now. But I’ll be in my grave before then, if\r\nso be as my prayers be granted.”\r\n\r\n“They winna do that,” said the keeper; “dinna fash your auld head with\r\nsic notions. And we maunna hae the owls killed oot either, or we’ll be\r\nowerrun with rats in a year or twa. When the cat’s awa--ye ken. But what\r\nfor is a’ this about owls, I wonder? Are they gaun clean doited in\r\nLunnon then?”\r\n\r\nAnd leaving Oliver, Mr. McNab walked up to the barber’s shop, and after\r\nlooking at the milliner’s window, he went in, and did not come out again\r\nwhile Oliver remained within sight.\r\n\r\nThe old fellow waited a while, and walked about the fair; but he saw no\r\nmore of McNab, and had to turn his face homewards without a word of\r\nreassurance. As he passed through the narrow passage, thronged with\r\nhard-faced men and boys, which divided the pens of crowded pigs and\r\nsheep, it made him wince a little to see Mr. Pogson, his ruddy face\r\nstill ruddier, and his sunken little eyes sparkling with drink and with\r\nunwonted expectations of wealth, cutting at the hind-quarters of his\r\nnewly-bought pigs with the sapling, shouting in a hard voice to greasy\r\nfriends, and looking at every one who came near him as if they had\r\nbetter mind what they were about. For old Oliver he had a profound\r\ncontempt; and as the old man passed him, he caught the pig that was\r\nnearest him at the moment such a cut with his switch, that its squeaks\r\nresounded through the street; it tried to escape over the backs of its\r\nfellows, who all with a loud chorus of squeaking rushed to the further\r\nside of the pen. Which so pleased Mr. Pogson that he turned to the old\r\nman with a wink, as if to say, “Now you see the proper way to treat\r\nanimals.” But Oliver had passed on quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nOld Oliver trudged down the road from the little town on the hill, with\r\nhis fairing under his arm, thinking of his old wife sitting in her\r\nchimney-corner, and of the old days when he bought the pretty young\r\nfarm-servant her first fairing, in that same town and on that very same\r\nday in May, some five-and-forty years ago. Straight before him were the\r\nCotswold hills, and on their slope he could see the spire of Highfield\r\nchurch, and further down and nearer was the great dark mass of Truerne\r\nwood, hiding the hamlet where he had lived all his life. The sight of\r\nthe wood made him think of the owls, and he unconsciously quickened his\r\npace, as if to make haste and see that all was right with them as yet.\r\n\r\nDown the long sloping road he went, and then turning off by a\r\nbridle-path, passed through another wood--not his, and therefore no\r\nplace for dallying in--and crossing the river by an old flood-beaten\r\nbridge, took his way through a wealth of buttercups that gilded his old\r\nboots with yellow dust, to the further side of the water-meadows, where\r\nhis own beloved wood came down in gentle slopes to the valley. Evening\r\nwas coming on and the light was subdued; all was quiet and peaceful\r\nunless a nightingale broke out suddenly in song from a thicket, or the\r\nvoice of the chiff-chaff rang out from overhead. Over the bluebells the\r\nshadows were lengthening, and against their deep blue, as it mingled in\r\nthe distance with the blue of the sky peeping through the branches, rose\r\nthe straight and darkening stem of many an ancient tree. What a change\r\nfrom the noise and worry and ill-dealing and cruelty of the fair!\r\n\r\nWhen he came to his own old oak he paused and listened; but no sound\r\nwas heard but the song of the wood-wren in the higher foliage.\r\n\r\n“‘Tis all right as yet,” he said to himself; “they’re not astir so early\r\nas this; but maybe they’ll be hooting when Pogson and the pigs come\r\nalong later, and then they’re marked birds; the warrant ’ll be out\r\nagainst ’em. The Lord deliver them out of the hand of the Philistines,”\r\nsaid the old fellow, quite aloud. “I’ll get a bit of supper, and come\r\nand have a look presently”; and he went on up the ride.\r\n\r\nClose behind him was the gamekeeper. Mr. McNab, finding that there were\r\nno spaniel-puppies at the fair, had no further reason to stay there; for\r\nhe had a poor opinion of the people of those parts, and did not care to\r\nlisten to their stupid talk, or to help them to drink bad beer. Moreover\r\nduring his visit to the barber he had satisfied himself that his domains\r\nwere really in danger of being invaded by unsportsmanlike clod-hoppers\r\nin search of owls; and the more he thought of it, the more impossible it\r\nseemed to have fellows like Pogson roaming about in his woods with\r\nfirearms. It was bad enough to have pigs driven through your wood every\r\nfair-day, though that could not be helped where there was a right of way\r\nfor man and beast; but he had reason to suspect Mr. Pogson of other\r\nstill more objectionable practices, and at all times disliked the man as\r\na noisy, bullying lout.\r\n\r\nSo he had left the fair soon after Oliver, only stopping at a shop in\r\nthe outskirts of the town to buy a good-sized twist of strong cord. He\r\ndid not stay to look at the view, or to sit on the bridge and watch the\r\nwater, or to admire the bluebells when he came to Truerne wood. Mr.\r\nMcNab was a man of a practical mind, and a swift walker; and he had\r\nnearly caught up Oliver when he arrived at the old oak-tree, so that he\r\njust heard the old fellow’s ejaculation about the Philistines, and then\r\nsaw his smockfrock retreating up the ride. The Scotchman stopped and\r\nwatched it disappear.\r\n\r\n“Yon auld Oliver has mair gude sense,” he said to himself, “than a’\r\nthese blathering gowks o’ pigdrivers; and he kens his Bible too! A wee\r\nbit too saft--mair backbane, mair backbone! But he’s no sae doited as\r\nthe rest!”\r\n\r\nThe sun was almost setting, but the owls in the old oak were still\r\nsilent. “They’ll be hooting in an hour or twa,” he said, as Oliver had\r\nsaid it before him; and drawing the twist of cord from his pocket, he\r\nstepped aside among the bluebells to the oak-tree. Plenty of young\r\nground ashes were shooting up among the flowers, and with the help of\r\nthese, and of a low hazel bush or two, he contrived to fasten the cord\r\nin a pretty tight circle round the tree-trunk, at a distance of some\r\nhalf-dozen yards from it, and about a foot and a half from the ground.\r\nThere being still plenty of cord, he looked about for a log of wood, and\r\nfinding one not too heavy, he tied the cord round it, and hoisted it up\r\non a low branch of the big tree, on the side nearest the ride, just\r\nbalancing it at the junction of one gnarled bough with another, so that\r\na strong pull at the string would easily bring it down. This done, he\r\nfastened the other end tightly down to his circle below, and then\r\npaused, with a face of extreme gravity, to contemplate his apparatus.\r\n\r\nSuddenly his severe features relaxed. There had shot across his memory\r\na certain scene, when as a bare-legged callant playing on his native\r\nbraes, he had devised just such a booby-trap to catch another boy, with\r\na view of securing for himself a certain nest in which eggs were about\r\nto be laid. The grim features of Mr. McNab relaxed, I say, and in his\r\nsolitude in the wood he burst out into a hearty ringing laugh.\r\n\r\n“At bairn’s wark in my auld age! And what wad the Dominie say? Wad I be\r\nfor a crack wi’ the tawse, or the knuckle-end of the auld crab-stick at\r\nhame, eh!”\r\n\r\nMr. McNab lit his pipe, the better to resume his ordinary composure; and\r\npuffing at it with lips which now and then a convulsive movement almost\r\ncompelled to laughter, he strode away through the wood to his own\r\ndwelling on the further side of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nAnd now the wood was left once more in profound peace. Since old Oliver\r\npassed through it the shadows had grown still longer, and from the west\r\nthere now came a flush of sunset through the boughs, turning the blue\r\ncarpet into one of deeper purple; while against the fading light the\r\ngreat tree-trunks stood up solemnly, slowly blackening as their shadows\r\ndied away. Here and there a wood-pigeon broke the stillness in the\r\nboughs, or a nightingale broke out into a flash of song, and ceased\r\nagain as suddenly; but the owls in the old tree began to bestir\r\nthemselves in soft silence, and reserved their hootings until they\r\nshould have procured a meal for the downy nestlings in the deep warm\r\nhole. But beware, O ye owls and owlets, for the Philistines are at hand,\r\nand the warrant of the ladies is out against you!\r\n\r\nAs the last hues of sunset died away on the Cotswold hills there came\r\nthrough the wood unlucky little Mr. Weekes; small in person and small\r\nin acres; discontented with his dealings at the fair, and with things in\r\ngeneral, and ready for any project that might put a pound or two into\r\nhis pocket without actually endangering his limbs or his liberty. As he\r\npassed the great oak, a large creature flew noiselessly over his head in\r\nthe direction of the tree, and woke up Mr. Weekes’ memory, which had\r\nbeen halting in the slough of his discontent.\r\n\r\n“Ah, the owls!” he thought. “Half-a-guinea a-piece, did he say? Well, it\r\nmight be, if there’s a run on ’em; and that fellow Pogson said he was\r\ncoming here first thing to-morrow morning to shoot ’em; but I’ll be even\r\nwith the prosperous fat brute.”\r\n\r\nMr. Weekes thought of the morning’s pig-driving, into which he had been\r\ncompelled by Pogson’s superior force of character; of the two ribs of\r\nhis wife’s umbrella which he had broken on the back of one wayward\r\nsqueaker; and of the long detour he had taken when leaving Northstow, to\r\navoid falling again in with the pig-driver, and being once more driven\r\nto drive.\r\n\r\nSo he went home to his rickety little homestead beyond the wood, and\r\nreached down his old gun from its place above the chimney-piece; only\r\nyielding to the injunctions of his wife that he must eat a bit o’ supper\r\nfirst, and that if he must be for shooting owls, he should begin by\r\nshooting the one which was stealing all their young pigeons. Obedient as\r\nusual, though querulous, Mr. Weekes presently took up his station in his\r\nyard, watching the dovecote and the darkening sky; but luckily for the\r\npigeons, whom the owls were nightly protecting from their enemies the\r\nrats, no owl made his appearance for a full half-hour after Mr. Weekes\r\nhad given them up in despair, and had carried off his gun to the wood in\r\nhopes of better luck.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mr. Pogson, after purchasing some dozen or so of fine porkers,\r\nand a bottle of brandy to help him in the arduous task of getting them\r\nhome safely, began in the late afternoon to drive them down the long\r\nhigh road towards the wood. The pigs were lively, and their owner began\r\nto be a little unsteady on his legs--a sensation which he more than once\r\nsought to correct by a draught of strong ale at a roadside\r\npublic-house. The remedy did not have the desired effect, and his\r\nprogress became slower and slower; but in spite of all obstacles, and by\r\ndint of extreme severity and a lavish outlay of bad language, he\r\ncontrived to conduct himself and his charges across the bridge and the\r\nmeadows to the edge of the wood without serious mishap, arriving there\r\nabout the time at which Weekes was prowling in his yard after the barn\r\nowl. The bottle of brandy was by this time more than half empty, and the\r\nwood was as dark as pitch.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Pogson had been in full possession of his wits he would hardly\r\nhave tried to force his way through the wood, and would have avoided the\r\nbridle-path, and taken his pigs a couple of miles round by the road; but\r\nhe had gone like an unreasoning animal in the way he was accustomed to,\r\nand now it was too late to turn back. He took another pull at the\r\nbottle, switched the nearest pigs, and pulling himself for a moment\r\ntogether, forced his drove into the narrow ride, trusting that they\r\nwould follow their noses and keep to the open path.\r\n\r\nIn the dense black darkness and stillness, a sleepy and a sickly\r\nfeeling came over Mr. Pogson’s usually hide-bound senses, from which he\r\nwas only for a moment awakened by a sudden movement of the pigs in front\r\nof him. Whether it were a badger in the path, or a prowling fox that had\r\nfrightened them, certain it is that at this moment they all faced about,\r\nand rushing with loud squeakings past the legs of their driver, vanished\r\nin a general stampede away into the wood.\r\n\r\nMr. Pogson stood aghast, and leant against a tree-trunk for support. The\r\nnoise of the pigs died away, and he was alone--alone in blank darkness.\r\nEven pigs are company, and now he would have given a good deal for the\r\ncompanionship of a single one of his victims. There was a singing in his\r\nears, a cold sweat on his hard brow; he felt quite unable to go further;\r\nhis head swam.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he heard a voice from overhead--a gentle voice, reproachful and\r\nsomewhat hollow and ghostly--\r\n\r\n“Whoo? Tu-whoo?”\r\n\r\nMr. Pogson felt a creepy sensation, and would have cast himself to the\r\nground and hidden his face in the bluebells, but again the voice asked--\r\n\r\n“Whoo? Whoo? Tu-whoo?”\r\n\r\n“Pogson o’ Highfield,” cried the belated man in answer. But in still\r\nmore reproachful accents, the voice demanded for the third time--\r\n\r\n“Whoo? Tu-whoo?”\r\n\r\n“Pogson o’ Highfield, pig-dealer,” cried the wretched man in stuttering\r\naccents; “a man as never did no harm to nothing in all his life!”\r\n\r\n“Whoo? Whoo?” said the voice, seeming to retreat, and urged to follow it\r\nby some mysterious influence, Mr. Pogson staggered forward a few paces.\r\nBut he had hardly left his tree for more than half a minute, when\r\nsomething caught him on the shins and tripped him up; at the same moment\r\nhe received a violent blow on the head which, added to the effects of\r\nthe brandy, stretched him quite unconscious on the ground. There he lay\r\nin the darkness, with the bottle slipping out of his pocket, while the\r\nmysterious voice continued to question him in vain from the old oak-tree\r\noverhead.\r\n\r\nAnd now, but for the voice, all is silent again for a few minutes.\r\nStay, who is this coming down the “light,” betraying his presence by the\r\ncrackling of a dry twig beneath his boot? It is Mr. Weekes, bent on\r\nfurther profitable destruction; who would not have ventured himself in\r\nthe wood after dark for fear of ghosts and other terrors, but is now\r\nurged to unwonted courage by the hope of gain and by the companionship\r\nof his old gun. He is making for the tree where he saw the owl at\r\nsunset.\r\n\r\nAs he advanced deeper into the dead blackness of the wood, Mr. Weekes\r\nbegan to feel a slight uneasiness, which was soon uncomfortably\r\nincreased by strange noises on his right-hand, as of weird creatures\r\nmaking towards him through the underwood. But he was now close to his\r\ntree, and he could hear the hooting of the owls that were to be his\r\nprey. He was in the act of raising his gun, ready to fire when an owl\r\nshould cross the bit of sky-line open above him, when the noises\r\nincreased to his right, and with a terrific crackling and confusion an\r\narmy of terrible creatures burst out upon him into the ride. All his\r\ncourage fled. With a yell of fear he discharged his gun at the\r\nadvancing foes, and then throwing it at them as a last resource, took to\r\nhis heels and ran from them. But he had not run many yards when he\r\ntripped first over a heavy body, and then over a tightened cord, and\r\nlosing at once his balance and his senses, Mr. Weekes swooned outright.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n“Did ye hear the gun then?” said the keeper to Oliver, as they met a few\r\nminutes later at the entrance to the wood. “There’s mischief _here_,\r\nforbye at the barber’s. Tak’ yon big stick, mon, and gang ye on wi’ the\r\nlantern.”\r\n\r\nThey went softly down the ride together, neither speaking again.\r\nPresently the keeper stumbled over some solid body lying in the grass,\r\nand Oliver, applying the lantern to it, discovered the corpse of a pig.\r\nThe keeper whistled softly, and turned it over with his foot.\r\n\r\n“Lawfu’ spoil,” he whispered, “lawfu’ spoil. Ye shall taste Pogson’s\r\nbacon yet afore ye die, Oliver!”\r\n\r\nThen they found the gun, which Mr. McNab, now in his element, seized as\r\nfurther spoil, and gave to Oliver to carry instead of the big stick. And\r\nnow he turned aside for a few yards to see what other sport his bairn’s\r\ntricks of that day might have brought him. Oliver followed close at his\r\nheels with the lantern.\r\n\r\n“Whoo! Tu-whoo!” said the owl overhead.\r\n\r\n“Ay, ye may weel hoot at ’em,” said the keeper, as the lantern revealed\r\nthe prostrate forms of Mr. Pogson and Mr. Weekes; the latest arrival\r\nlying across the other, and seeming to embrace him with one arm, while\r\nthe hand of the other was thrust into a tuft of faded primroses.\r\n\r\nOliver and McNab regarded this spectacle for a few moments in silence.\r\nThen Oliver, catching sight of the bottle slipping from the pig-dealer’s\r\npocket, turned his wistful eyes on the Scotchman.\r\n\r\n“Mr. McNab,” he said, “I’m an old man, and maybe as I won’t be\r\nwoodcutting here much longer; but don’t you--for my sake don’t you”\r\n(here he shyly laid his wrinkled hand on the keeper’s arm), “let such\r\nsodden brutes as these come along and take the lives of innocent\r\ncreatures--creatures as God above loves, and has made me for to love\r\ntoo--and all for a few shillings, or maybe guineas, and to please the\r\nladies in Lunnon as don’t know what a wood be like, nor what creatures\r\nlives their lives here. I’ve known this tree for more nor fifty year,\r\nbut the owls ha’ known it belike for five hundred; and now, afore I’m\r\ndead, the warrant’s out agen them. The fine ladies wants their feathers,\r\nbut they don’t know what they’re doing--they don’t _think_ what they do,\r\nMr. McNab. ’Tis fashion, I take it, only fashion, and it’ll blow over in\r\na bit if you’ll but stop ’em now. I’m an old fool maybe, but God knows\r\nI’ve none too many to care about, or for to care about me, but my old\r\nwoman, and beside her there’s none but these birds and beasts in the\r\nwood. And the peace of it, and the quiet of the life in it! Don’t you\r\nlet it be rooted up, Mr. McNab, nor the wild beast of the field devour\r\nit!”\r\n\r\nThe keeper slapped him on the back of his smockfrock, and then seized\r\nhim by the hand. “Oliver, my auld lad,” he said, “ye’ve just saved them\r\nout o’ the hand of the Pheelistines! And ye shall never want for friends\r\nto care for ye, be they owls or be they McNabs!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd this was the story that old Oliver used to tell, with many a kindly\r\nword of respect for his friend the keeper, till one day, as I said at\r\nthe beginning, death came upon him painlessly under that very tree,\r\nwhile the cuckoo sang in the distance, and the chiff-chaffs two notes\r\nechoed from the sunny end of the wood. How he came to know what happened\r\nto Mr. Pogson and the pigs is more than I can tell; probably the owls\r\ntold it to him, or it may be that the conscience-stricken pig-dealer\r\nrevealed to him alone the story, as to one who understood, as none else\r\ndid, the mysteries of Truerne wood.\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, it is certain that the enemy never again invaded\r\nhis paradise. The owls were never disturbed, and by some mysterious\r\nagency the placard disappeared almost at once from the barber’s window.\r\nMr. Pogson never passed through the wood again, and finding that\r\ndistorted versions of his adventures were abroad in Highfield (where\r\nthey are still told with relish by the winter fireside), he removed to a\r\nvillage some miles away, a milder and more merciful man. Mr. Weekes too\r\nwas not long in giving up his farm, and disappearing entirely from the\r\nneighbourhood. In peace the owls and Oliver lived out their days under\r\nthe grave but kindly guardianship of Mr. McNab the keeper; and when I\r\nlast passed through the wood it showed no signs of the presence of the\r\nPhilistine.\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nR.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks."
