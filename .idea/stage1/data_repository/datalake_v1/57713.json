Several\r\nfootnote markers have been inserted where they were missing from the\r\ntext. The _very_ long table of contents has somewhat inconsistent\r\nlevels of indentation that don’t correspond accurately with headings\r\nused in the text. Some illustrations have been moved nearer to the\r\nrelevant text and their locations may differ from those specified\r\nin the list of illustrations. A few illustrations that lacked an\r\nidentifying number have been correctly numbered. The book contains\r\nextensive sections of quoted text but these are identified by square\r\nbrackets rather than by traditional quotation marks. Two different\r\nsized fonts were used to print the original body text, a feature that\r\nis replicated in this transcription. Several short passages of text\r\nwere inserted by the printer at the last minute, and these are enclosed\r\nin lightly shaded text boxes.\r\n\r\nA list of spelling corrections and inconsistencies is appended at the\r\nend of the book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE ANIMAL\r\n  PARASITES OF MAN\r\n\r\n\r\n  BY\r\n  H. B.

The result is that parts of the\r\nbook have been rewritten, and, apart from early historical references,\r\nthe work of Braun has disappeared. This is more particularly the case\r\nwith the Protozoa section of the present work. The numerous additions,\r\ndue to the great output of scientific literature and other delays in\r\npublication, have led to the book being somewhat less homogeneous\r\nthan we desired, and have necessitated the use of appendices to allow\r\nof the presentation of new facts only recently ascertained. Many new\r\nillustrations have been added or substituted for older, less detailed\r\nones. Some of these new figures were drawn specially for this book.\r\n\r\nThe first section, on the Protozoa, has been written by Dr.\r\nFantham, there being little of the original text left except parts\r\nof the historical portions, and thus the section on Protozoa must\r\nbe considered as new. The second section, on Worms (except the\r\nAcanthocephala, Gordiidæ and Hirudinea), has been remodelled by\r\nProfessor Stephens to such an extent that this, too, must not be looked\r\nupon as a translation of Braun’s book. With regard to the Arthropoda,\r\nmuch remains as in the last English edition, but some new matter added\r\nby Braun in his fourth German edition is included, and much new matter\r\nby Mr. Theobald has been incorporated. As regards the Appendix by Dr.\r\nSeifert, the first section has been remodelled, but the sections on\r\nthe Helminthes and the Arthropoda are practically translations of the\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\nThe authors desire to express their thanks to Miss A. Porter, D.Sc.,\r\nJ. P. Sharples, Esq., B.A., M.R.C.S., and H. F. Carter, Esq., F.E.S.,\r\nfor valuable help. They also wish to thank the authors, editors,\r\nand publishers of several manuals and journals for their courtesy\r\nin allowing the reproduction of certain of their illustrations.

There are both plants\r\nand animals (Phytoparasites and Zoöparasites) which lead a parasitic\r\nlife in or upon other plants and other animals.\r\n\r\nPhytoparasites are not included in the following descriptions of the\r\nforms of parasitism, but a very large number of animal parasites\r\n(zoöparasites) are described. The number of the latter, as a rule, is\r\nvery much underrated. How great a number of animal parasites exists\r\nmay be gathered from the fact that all classes of animals are subject\r\nto them. Some of the larger groups, such as _Sporozoa_, _Cestoda_,\r\n_Trematoda_ and _Acanthocephala_, consist entirely of parasitic\r\nspecies, and parasitism even occurs among the vertebrates (_Myxine_).\r\nIt therefore follows that the characteristics of parasites lie, not in\r\ntheir structure, but in the manner of their existence.\r\n\r\nParasitism itself occurs in various ways and degrees. According to\r\nR. Leuckart, we should distinguish between OCCASIONAL (temporary)\r\nand PERMANENT (stationary) PARASITISM. Occasional parasites, such as\r\nthe flea (_Pulex irritans_), the bed-bug (_Cimex lectularius_), the\r\nleech (_Hirudo medicinalis_), and others, only seek their “host” to\r\nobtain nourishment and find shelter while thus occupied. Without being\r\nbound to the host, they usually abandon the latter soon after the\r\nattainment of their object (_Cimex, Hirudo_), or they may remain on\r\nthe body of their host throughout their entire development from the\r\nhatching of the egg (_Pediculus_). It follows from this mode of living\r\nthat the occasional parasites become sometimes distinguishable from\r\ntheir free-living relatives, though only to a slight extent. It is,\r\ntherefore, seldom difficult to determine the systematic position of\r\ntemporary parasites from their structure.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of their mode of life, all these temporary parasites\r\nlive on the external surface of the body of their host, though more\r\nrarely they take up their abode in cavities easily accessible from\r\nthe exterior, such as the mouth, nose and gills. They are therefore\r\nfrequently called EPIZOA or ECTOPARASITES; but these designations do\r\nnot cover only the temporary parasites, because numerous epizoa (as for\r\ninstance the louse) are parasitic during their entire life.\r\n\r\nIn contradistinction to these temporary parasites, the permanent\r\nparasites obtain shelter as well as food from their host for a long\r\nperiod, sometimes during the entire course of their life. They do not\r\nseek their host only when requiring nourishment, but always remain with\r\nit, thus acquiring substantial protection. The permanent parasites,\r\nas a rule, live within the internal organs, preferably in those which\r\nare easily accessible from the exterior, such as the intestine, with\r\nits appendages. Nevertheless, permanent parasites are also found in\r\nseparate organs and systems, such as the muscular and vascular systems,\r\nhollow bones and brain, while some live on the outer skin. Here again,\r\nthe terms ENTOZOA and ENDOPARASITES do not include all stationary\r\nparasites; to the latter, for instance, the lice belong, which pass\r\nall their life on the surface of the body of their host, where they\r\nfind shelter and food and go through their entire development. The\r\nectoparasitic trematodes, numerous insects, crustacea, and other\r\nanimals live in the same manner.\r\n\r\nAll “HELMINTHES,” however, belong to the group of permanent parasites.\r\nThis term is now applied to designate certain lowly worms which lead\r\na parasitic life (intestinal worms); but they are not all so termed.\r\nFor instance, the few parasitic TURBELLARIA are never classed with\r\nthe helminthes, although closely related to them. The turbellarians,\r\nin fact, belong to a group of animals of which only a few members are\r\nparasitic, whereas the helminthes comprise those groups of worms of\r\nwhich all species (_Cestoda_, _Trematoda_, _Acanthocephala_), or at\r\nleast the majority of species (_Nematoda_), are parasitic. Formerly the\r\nLinguatulidæ (_Pentastoma_) were classed with the helminthes because\r\ntheir existence is also endoparasitic, and because the shape of their\r\nbody exhibits a great similarity to that of the true helminthes. Since\r\nthe study of the development of the Linguatulidæ (P. J. van Beneden,\r\n1848, and R. Leuckart, 1858) has demonstrated that they are really\r\ndegenerate arachnoids, they have been separated from the helminthes.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to emphasize the fact that the helminthes or\r\nintestinal worms do not represent a systematic group of animals, but\r\nonly a biological one, and that the helminthes can only be discussed\r\nin the same sense as land and water animals are mentioned, _i.e._,\r\nwithout conveying the idea of a classification in such a grouping. It\r\nis true that formerly this was universally done, but very soon the\r\nerror of such a classification was recognized. Still, until the middle\r\nof last century, the helminthes were regarded as a systematic group,\r\nalthough C. E. v. Baer (1827) and F. S. Leuckart (1827) strenuously\r\nopposed this view. Under the active leadership of J. A. E. Goeze,\r\nJ. G. H. Zeder, J. G. Bremser, K. A. Rudolphi and F. Dujardin, the\r\nknowledge of the helminthes (helminthology) developed into a special\r\nstudy, but unfortunately it lost all connection with zoology. It\r\nrequired the intervention of Carl Vogt to disestablish the helminthes\r\nas one class of animals, by uniting the various groups with those of\r\nthe free-living animals most closely related to them (_Platyhelminthes,\r\nNemathelminthes_).\r\n\r\nPERMANENT PARASITISM in the course of time has caused animals adopting\r\nthis mode of life to undergo considerable, sometimes even striking,\r\nbodily changes, permanent ectoparasites having as yet undergone least\r\nalteration. The latter sometimes bear so unmistakably the likeness to\r\nthe group to which they belong, that even a superficial knowledge of\r\ntheir structure and appearance often suffices for the recognition of\r\ntheir systematic position. For instance, though the louse, like many\r\ndecidedly temporary parasites, has lost its wings--a characteristic of\r\ninsects--in consequence of parasitism, yet nobody would deny its insect\r\nnature; such also occurs in other temporary parasites (_Cimex, Pulex_).\r\nOn the other hand, the changes in a number of permanent ectoparasites\r\n(such as parasitic Crustacea) are far more considerable, and correspond\r\nwith those that have occurred in permanent endoparasites.\r\n\r\nThese alterations depend partly on retrogression and partly on the\r\nacquisition of new peculiarities. In the former case, the change\r\nconsists in the loss of those organs which have become useless in a\r\npermanent parasitic condition of existence, such as wings in the louse,\r\nand the articulated extremities seen in the larval stage of parasitic\r\nCrustacea. The loss of these organs goes hand in hand with the cohesion\r\nof segments of the body that were originally separate, and alterations\r\nin the muscular and nervous systems. In the same manner another means\r\nof locomotion is lost--the ciliated coat--which is possessed by many\r\npermanent parasites during their larval period. To all appearances,\r\nthis character is not secondary and recently acquired, but represents\r\na primary character inherited from free-living progenitors, and still\r\ntransmitted to the altered descendants, because of its use during\r\nthe larval stage (_e.g._, the larvæ of a great many Trematodes, the\r\noncospheres of some Cestodes). Amongst the retrogressions, the loss of\r\nthe organs of sense may be mentioned, particularly the eyes, which are\r\nstill present, not only in the nearest free-living forms but also in\r\nthe free-living larvæ of true parasites. It is only quite exceptionally\r\nthat the eyes are subsequently retained, as a rule they are lost.\r\nLastly, in a great many cases the digestive system also disappears,\r\nas in parasitic Crustacea, in a few nematodes and trematodes, in all\r\ncestodes and Acanthocephala. There remain at most the rudiments of the\r\nmuscles of the fore-gut, but these are adapted to entirely different\r\nuses.\r\n\r\nThe new characters which permanent parasites may acquire are, first\r\nof all, the remarkably manifold CLASPING and CLINGING ORGANS, which\r\nare seldom (as in parasitic Crustacea) directly joined on to already\r\nexisting structures. In those instances in which organs for the\r\nconveyance of food are retained, these likewise frequently undergo\r\ntransformation, in consequence of the altered food and manner of\r\nfeeding. Such alterations consist, for instance, in the transformation\r\nof a masticating mouth apparatus into the piercing and sucking organs\r\nof parasitic insects.\r\n\r\nHERMAPHRODITISM (as in Trematodes, Cestodes, and a few Nematodes)\r\nis a further peculiarity of many permanent parasites; moreover, the\r\nassociation in couples that occurs, especially in trematodes, may\r\nlead to complete cohesion and, exceptionally, also to re-separation\r\nof the sexes. In many cases the females only are parasitic, while the\r\nmales live a free life, or there may be in addition the so-called\r\ncomplementary males. Occasionally the male alone is parasitic, and in\r\nthat case lives within the female of the same species, which may live\r\nfree, like certain Gephyrea (_Bonellia_); or the female also may be\r\nparasitic, as _Trichosoma crassicaudum_, which lives in the bladder of\r\nthe sewer rat (_Mus decumanus_).\r\n\r\nWe have numerous proofs that demonstrate how considerably the original\r\nfeatures of many parasites have become changed. We need only draw\r\nattention to the aforementioned Linguatulidæ, also to many of the\r\nparasitic Crustacea belonging to various orders. In all of these a\r\nknowledge of the larval stages--in which there is no alteration, or\r\nat most only a slight degree of change--serves to determine their\r\nsystematic position, _i.e._, the nearest conditions of relationship.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable changes are observed in those groups that contain\r\nonly a few parasitic members, the majority leading a free life. A\r\nstriking instance is afforded by a snail, the well-known _Entoconcha\r\nmirabilis_, Müller. This mollusc consists merely of an elongated sac\r\nliving in a Holothurian (_Synapta digitata_). It possesses none of\r\nthe characteristics of either the Gastropoda or any molluscs, and\r\nin its interior there is nothing to be observed but the organs of\r\ngeneration and the embryos. Nevertheless, the _Entoconcha_ is decidedly\r\na parasitic snail, as is clearly proved by its larvæ, but it is a snail\r\nwhich, in consequence of parasitism, has lost all the characteristics\r\nof molluscs in its mature condition, but still exhibits them in the\r\nearly stages of development.\r\n\r\nCertain nematodes show very clearly to what devious courses parasitism\r\nmay lead. The _Atractonema gibbosum_, the life-history of which has\r\nbeen described by R. Leuckart, and which lives in the larvæ and pupæ of\r\na dipterous insect (_Cecidomyia_), exhibits, in its early stage, the\r\nordinary characteristics of other threadworms. A few weeks later--the\r\nmales having died off immediately after copulation--the females are\r\ntransformed into spindle-shaped bodies, the mouth and anus of which are\r\nclosed. They carry with them an irregularly shaped appendage, in which\r\nthe segmenting ova are situated, and in which the further conditions of\r\nlife of the _Atractonema_ are accomplished. A minute examination has\r\ndemonstrated that this appendage is the prolapsed and enlarged vagina\r\nof the animal which has become merely a supplementary attachment. The\r\nconditions present in the _Sphærularia_, the nematoid nature of which\r\nwas long undiscovered, are still more remarkable. It was only when\r\nSiebold proved that typical nematodes were hatched from their eggs that\r\ntheir nature was recognized. The nematodes thus produced have not the\r\nslightest resemblance to the parent.\r\n\r\nThe researches of Lubbock, A. Schneider, and more particularly of R.\r\nLeuckart, have shown that what we call _Sphærularia bombi_ is not\r\nan animal but merely an organ--the vagina--of a nematode worm. This\r\nvagina at first grows, sac-like, from the body of the tiny nematode; it\r\ngradually assumes enormous dimensions (2 cm. in length); it contains\r\nthe sexual organs and parts of the intestine. The remaining portion of\r\nthe actual animal then becomes small and shrivelled; it may be easily\r\noverlooked, being but an appendage to the vagina with its independent\r\nexistence, and it finally disappears altogether.\r\n\r\nThe GREAT FERTILITY of parasites is another of their peculiarities,\r\nthough this may be also the case to a certain degree with some of the\r\nfree-living animals, the progeny of which are likewise exposed to\r\nenormous destruction.\r\n\r\nMore remarkable, however, is the fact that the young of the\r\nendoparasites only very exceptionally grow to maturity by the side\r\nof their parents. Sooner or later they leave the organ inhabited by\r\nthe parents, frequently reach the open, and after a shorter or longer\r\nperiod of free existence seek new hosts. During their free period,\r\nmoreover, a considerable growth may be attained, or metamorphosis\r\nmay take place, or even multiplication. In the exceptional cases in\r\nwhich the young remain within the same host, they nevertheless usually\r\nquit the organ inhabited by the parents. They likewise rarely attain\r\nmaturity within the host inhabited by the parents, but only, as in\r\nother cases, after having gained access to fresh hosts.\r\n\r\nThese transmigrations play a very important _rôle_ in the natural\r\nhistory of the internal parasites, but they frequently conceal the\r\ncycle of development, for sometimes there are INTERMEDIATE GENERATIONS,\r\nwhich themselves invade intermediate hosts. Even when there are\r\nno intermediate generations, THE SYSTEM OF INTERMEDIATE HOSTS is\r\nfrequently maintained by the endoparasites.\r\n\r\nAccording to the kind of food ingested by parasites, it has recently\r\nbecome usual to separate the true parasites from those animals that\r\nfeed on the superfluity of the food of the host, or on products which\r\nare no longer necessary to him, and to call the latter MESSMATES or\r\nCOMMENSALS. As examples, the Ricinidæ are thus designated, because,\r\nlike actual lice, they dwell among the fur of mammals or the plumage\r\nof birds. They do not, however, suck blood, for which their mouth\r\napparatus is unsuited, but subsist on useless epidermic scales.\r\nThese epizoa, according to J. P. van Beneden, are, to a certain\r\nextent, useful to their hosts by removing deciduous materials which\r\nunder certain circumstances might become harmful to them.[1] This\r\ninvestigator, who has contributed so greatly to our knowledge of\r\nparasites, assigns the Ricines to the MUTUALISTS, under which term\r\nhe comprises animals of various species which live in common, and\r\nconfer certain benefits on one another. The mutualists are usually\r\nintimately connected in a mutually advantageous association known as\r\n“symbiosis.”[2]\r\n\r\n[1] According to Sambon, the Ricinidæ are by no means advantageous to\r\ntheir hosts. These Hemipterous parasites give rise to an intolerable\r\nitching which may cause loss of rest, emaciation, and sometimes even\r\ndeath. Birds suffering from phthiriasis of the Ricines are usually in\r\nbad health.\r\n\r\n[2] For further information on these conditions, see “Die Schmarotzer\r\ndes Thierreichs,” by P. J. van Beneden, Leipzig, 1876; and “Die\r\nSymbiose,” by O. Hertwig.\r\n\r\n_Incidental and Pseudo Parasites._--In many cases the parasites\r\nare confined to certain hosts, and may therefore be designated as\r\n_specific_ to such hosts. Thus, hitherto, _Tænia solium_ and _Tænia\r\nsaginata_ in their adult condition have only been found in man; _Tænia\r\ncrassicollis_ only in the cat; _Brandesia_ (_Distoma_) _turgida_ and\r\n_Halipegus_ (_Distoma_) _ovocaudatas_ only in _Rana esculenta_, and so\r\nforth. In many other cases, however, certain species of parasites are\r\ncommon to several, and sometimes many, species of hosts; _Dipylidium\r\ncaninum_ is found in the domestic cat as well as in the dog; _Fasciola\r\nhepatica_ is found in a large number of herbivorous mammals (nineteen\r\nspecies), _Diplodiscus_ (_Amphistomum_) _subclavatus_ in numerous\r\nurodele and ecaudate amphibia, _Holostomum variabile_ in about\r\ntwenty-four species of birds, and so on. In these cases the hosts\r\nare almost invariably closely related, belonging, as a rule, to the\r\nsame family or order, or at any rate to the same class. _Trichinella\r\nspiralis_, which is found in man, and in the pig, bear, rat, mouse,\r\ncat, fox, badger, polecat and marten, and is capable of being\r\nartificially cultivated in the dog, rabbit, sheep, horse, in other\r\nmammals, and even in birds, is one of the most striking exceptions.\r\n\r\nSome parasites are so strictly confined to one species of host that,\r\neven when artificially introduced into animals very closely related\r\nto their normal host, they do not thrive, but sooner or later, often\r\nvery quickly, die off, and very rarely establish themselves. For\r\nexample, repeated attempts have been made to rear the adult _Tænia\r\nsolium_ in the dog, or to rear _Cysticercus cellulosæ_ in the ox,\r\nor the _Cysticercus_ of _Tænia saginata_ in the pig, but they have\r\nalways proved unsuccessful. Only exceptionally has it been possible\r\nto transfer _Cœnurus cerebralis_, the larval stage of a tapeworm\r\n(_Tænia cœnurus_) of the dog from the brain of the sheep to that of\r\nthe domestic goat. On the other hand, in the case of the Trichinellæ\r\ntransference to a different host is easily accomplished.\r\n\r\nUnder natural conditions, it is not uncommon for certain kinds of\r\nspecific parasites to occur occasionally in unusual hosts. Their\r\nrelationship to the latter is that of INCIDENTAL PARASITES. Thus\r\n_Echinorhynchus gigas_, a specific parasite of the pig, is only an\r\nincidental parasite of man; _Fasciola hepatica_ and _Dicrocœlium\r\nlanceatum_ are specific to numerous kinds of mammals, but may be found\r\nincidentally in man. On the other hand, _Dibothriocephalus latus_, a\r\nspecific parasite of man, may occasionally take up its abode in the\r\ndog, cat and fox. As a rule, all those parasites of man that are only\r\nrarely met with, notwithstanding that human beings are constantly being\r\nobserved and examined by medical men, are termed INCIDENTAL PARASITES\r\nOF MAN. In many cases we are acquainted with the normal or specific\r\nhost of these parasites. Thus we know the specific host of _Balantidium\r\ncoli_, _Eimeria stiedæ_, _Fasciola hepatica_, _Dipylidium caninum_,\r\netc.; in others the host is as yet unknown. In the latter case the\r\nquestion partly relates to such forms as have been so deficiently\r\ndescribed that their recognition is impossible, partly to parasites\r\nof man in various regions of the earth, the Helminthes and parasites\r\nof which are totally unknown or only slightly known, or finally to\r\nearly developmental stages that are difficult to identify. Animals\r\nthat usually live free, and exceptionally become parasitic, may\r\nlikewise be called incidental parasites. In this category are included\r\na few _Anguillulidæ_ that have been observed in man; also _Leptodera\r\nappendiculata_, which usually lives free, but may occasionally become\r\nparasitic in black slugs (_Arion empiricorum_): when parasitic it\r\nattains a larger size, and produces far more eggs than when living a\r\nfree life. In order to avoid errors, the term “incidental parasites”\r\nshould be confined to true parasites which, besides living in their\r\nnormal host, may also live in other hosts. Leuckart speaks of\r\nFACULTATIVE PARASITISM in such forms as _Leptodera_. L. Oerley[3]\r\nsucceeded in artificially causing _Leptodera_ (_Rhabditis_) _pellio_\r\nto assume facultative parasitism by introducing these worms into the\r\nvagina of mice, where the parasites remained alive and multiplied.\r\n_Leptodera pellio_ dies in the intestines of mammals and man; it\r\nremains alive in frogs, but always escapes into the open with the fæces.\r\n\r\n[3] Oerley, L., “Der Rhabditiden und ihre medizinische Bedeutung,”\r\nBerlin, 1886, p. 65.\r\n\r\nRecently the incidental parasites of man have also been called\r\n“PSEUDO-PARASITES” or “PSEUDO-HELMINTHES.” Formerly, however, these\r\nterms were applied not only to living organisms that do not and cannot\r\nlive parasitically, and that only exceptionally and incidentally get\r\ninto man, but also to any foreign bodies, portions of animals and\r\nplants, or even pathological formations that left the human system\r\nthrough the natural channels, and the true nature of which was\r\nmisunderstood. Frequently these bodies were described as living or\r\ndead parasites and labelled with scientific names, as if they were\r\ntrue parasites. A study of these errors, which formerly occurred very\r\nfrequently, would be as interesting as it would be instructive. It\r\nis better not to use the expression pseudo-parasites for incidental\r\nparasites, but to keep to the original meaning, for it is not at all\r\ncertain that pseudo-parasites are not described, even nowadays.\r\n\r\n_The Influence of Parasites on the Host._--In a great many cases, we\r\nare not in a position to state anything regarding any marked influence\r\nexercised by the parasite on the organism, and on the conditions of\r\nlife, of the host. Most animals and many persons exhibit few signs of\r\nsuch influence, an exception being infestation with helminthes and\r\ncertain other parasites which produce eosinophilia in the blood. As a\r\ngeneral rule, the parasite, which is always smaller and weaker than\r\nits host, does not attempt to endanger the life of the latter, as\r\nsimultaneously its own existence would be threatened. The parasite,\r\nof course, robs its host, but usually in a scanty and sparing manner,\r\nand the injuries it inflicts can hardly be taken into account. There\r\nare, however, numerous cases[4] in which the situation of the parasites\r\nor the nature of their food, added to their number and movements, may\r\ncause more or less injury, and even threaten the life of the host.\r\nIt stands to reason that a _Cysticercus cellulosæ_ situated in the\r\nskin is of but slight importance, whereas one that has penetrated the\r\neye or the brain must give rise to serious disorders. A cuticular or\r\nintestinal parasite is, as a rule, less harmful than a blood parasite.\r\nA helminth, such as an _Ascaris lumbricoides_ or a tapeworm, that feeds\r\non the residues of foodstuffs within the intestine, will hardly affect\r\nits host by depriving it of this material. The case is different when\r\nthe parasites are very numerous, especially when the heavily infested\r\nhost happens to be a young individual needing all it ingests for its\r\nown requirements, and therefore unable to sustain the drain of numerous\r\nintruders in the intestine. Disturbances also set in more rapidly when\r\nthe intestinal helminthes are blood-suckers, the injury to the host\r\nresulting from the kind of food taken by the parasite.\r\n\r\n[4] Lühe, M., “Ueber d.

The latter may cause chiefly obstructions of small\r\nvessels or symptoms of pressure in affected or contiguous organs, with\r\nall those complications which may arise secondarily, or they may even\r\nlead to the complete obliteration of the organ invaded. Of course the\r\nsymptoms will vary according to the nature of the organ attacked.\r\n\r\nIn consequence also of the MOVEMENTS of the parasites, disorders are\r\nset up that may tend to serious pathological changes of the affected\r\norgans. The collective migrations, undertaken chiefly by the embryos\r\nof certain parasites (as in trichinosis, acute cestode tuberculosis),\r\nare still more harmful, as are also the unusual migrations of other\r\nparasites, which, incidentally, may lead to the formation of so-called\r\nworm abscesses or to abnormal communications (fistulæ) between organs\r\nthat are contiguous but possess no direct connection.\r\n\r\nRecently, several authors have called attention to the fact that the\r\nhelminthes produce substances that are TOXIC to their host; and the\r\neffects of such poisons explain the pathology of helminthiasis far more\r\nsatisfactorily than the theory of reflex action.\r\n\r\nIn a number of cases these toxic materials (leucomaines) have been\r\nisolated and their effects on living organisms demonstrated by actual\r\nexperiments. It also appears that the absorption of materials formed by\r\nthe decomposition of dead helminthes may likewise cause toxic effects.\r\nHowever, our knowledge of these conditions is as yet in its initial\r\nstage.[5]\r\n\r\n[5] Moursson et Schlagdenhauffen, “Nouv. rech. clin. et phys. sur\r\nquelq. liquides organ.,” _C. R.

The most that can be done is\r\nto deduce the presence of parasites by the exclusion of other causes.\r\nFortunately, however, there are sufficient means by which we may\r\nconfirm the diagnosis in a great many cases. Such means consist not\r\nonly in a minute examination of the patient by palpation, percussion\r\nand local inspection, but also in the microscopical examination of\r\nthe natural secretions and excretions of the body, such as sputum,\r\nnasal mucus, urine and fæces. Though such examinations may entail\r\nloss of time, they are necessary in the interest of the patient. It\r\nappears, moreover, that quackery, which has gained considerable ground\r\neven in the treatment of the helminthic diseases of man, can thus be\r\nconsiderably limited.\r\n\r\n_Origin of Parasites._[6]--In former times, when the only correct views\r\nthat existed related to the origin of the higher animals, the mode\r\nof multiplication of parasites as well as of other lowly animals was\r\nascribed to SPONTANEOUS GENERATION (_generatio æquivoca_), and this\r\nopinion prevailed throughout the middle ages. The writers on natural\r\nscience merely devoted their time to the interpretation of the views\r\nof the old authors, and perpetuated the opinions of the ancients\r\non questions, which, even in those days, could have been correctly\r\nexplained merely by observation.\r\n\r\n[6] Die Geschichte der “Klinisch wichtigen Parasiten,” behandelt H.\r\nVierordt im “Handb. d. Gesch. d. Med. hrsg.” v. M. Neuburger u. J.\r\nPagel, Bd. ii, 1903.\r\n\r\nIt was only when observations were again recommenced, and the\r\nmicroscope was invented, that the idea of spontaneous generation became\r\nlimited. Not only did the microscope reveal the organs of generation\r\nor their products (eggs) in numerous animals, but Redi succeeded in\r\nproving that the so-called _Helcophagi_ (flesh maggots) are only\r\nthe progeny of flies, and never appear in the flesh of slaughtered\r\nanimals when fully developed flies are prevented from approaching and\r\ndepositing their eggs on it. Swammerdam likewise knew that the “worms”\r\nliving in the caterpillars of butterflies were the larvæ of other\r\ninsects (ichneumon flies) which had laid their eggs in their bodies;\r\nhe also discovered the ova of lice. The two authors mentioned were,\r\nhowever, unwilling to see that the experience they had gained regarding\r\ninsects applied to the helminthes. Leeuwenhoek also vehemently opposed\r\nthe theory of a spontaneous generation, maintaining that, on a basis\r\nof common-sense, eggs, or at all events germs, must exist, even though\r\nthey could not be seen.\r\n\r\nThe use of the microscope also revealed a large number of very small\r\norganisms in the water and moist soil, some of which undoubtedly\r\nresembled helminthes. Considering the wide dissemination of these\r\nminute organisms, it was natural to conjecture that after their almost\r\nunavoidable introduction into the human system they should grow into\r\nhelminthes (Boerhave, Hoffmann). Linnæus went even further, for he\r\ntraced the descent of the liver-fluke of sheep from a free-living\r\nplanaria (_Dendrocœlum lacteum_), the _Oxyuris vermicularis_ from\r\nfree-living nematodes, and the _Tænia lata_ (_i.e._, _Dibothriocephalus\r\nlatus_) from a tapeworm (_Schistocephalus solidus_) found free in\r\nthe water. Linnæus’ statements met with general approval. However,\r\nwe must bear in mind that at that time the number of helminthes\r\nknown was very small, and many of the forms that we have long ago\r\nlearned to differentiate as specific were then regarded as belonging\r\nto one species. Linnæus’ statements were partly supported by similar\r\ndiscoveries by other investigators, such as Unzer, and partly also\r\nby the discovery of eggs in many helminthes. It was believed that\r\nthe eggs hatched in the outside world gave rise to free-living\r\ncreatures, and that these, after their introduction into the\r\nintestine, were transformed into helminthes. By means of these eggs\r\nthe old investigators tried to explain the HEREDITARY TRANSMISSION\r\nof the intestinal worms, which was universally believed until the\r\ncommencement of the last century. Some authors went so far as to regard\r\nthe intestinal worms as congenital or inherited; they maintained the\r\npossibility of direct transmission, as in suckling, and denied that\r\nthe eggs reaching the external world had anything to do with the\r\npropagation of the parasites.\r\n\r\nThe more minute comparison between the supposed free-living stages of\r\nthe helminthes and their adult forms, and the impossibility of finding\r\ncorresponding free forms for the ever-increasing number of parasitic\r\nspecies, revealed the improbability of Linnæus’ statements (O. Fr.\r\nMüller). It was the latter author also who recognized the origin of the\r\ntapeworms (_Schistocephalus, Ligula_) found free in the water. They\r\noriginate from fishes which they quit spontaneously.\r\n\r\nHowever, in spite of the fact that van Doeveren and Pallas correctly\r\nrecognized the significance of the eggs in the transmission of\r\nintestinal worms, these statements remained disregarded, as did\r\nAbildgaard’s observation, experimentally confirmed, that the (immature)\r\ncestodes from the abdominal cavity of sticklebacks became mature in the\r\nintestines of aquatic birds. Moreover, at the end of the eighteenth and\r\nthe commencement of the nineteenth centuries, after helminthology had\r\nbeen raised to a special branch of study by the successful results of\r\nthe investigations of numerous authors (Goeze, Bloch, Pallas, Müller,\r\nBatsch, Rudolphi, Bremser), many of whom experienced a “divine joy”\r\nin searching the intestines of animals for helminthes, some authors\r\nreverted to _generatio æquivoca_, without, however, entirely denying\r\nthe existence of organs of generation and eggs. The fact that a few\r\nnematodes bore living progeny--a fact of which Goeze was already\r\naware--had no influence on the erroneous opinion, as in such cases\r\nit was considered that the young continued to develop beside the old\r\nforms. There were also many helminthes known that never developed\r\nsexual organs and never produced eggs, and which therefore were\r\nreferred to _generatio æquivoca_. People were convinced that the\r\nintestinal mucous membrane or an intestinal villus could transform\r\nitself into a worm, either in a general morbid condition of the body,\r\nor in pathological changes of a more local character. The appearance of\r\nhelminthes was even regarded as useful and as a means for the expulsion\r\nof injurious matter.\r\n\r\nThese views, firmly rooted and supported by such eminent authorities\r\nas Rudolphi and Bremser, could not easily be overthrown. First, a\r\nchange took place in the knowledge of the trematodes. In 1773, O. Fr.\r\nMüller discovered _Cercariæ_ living free in water. He regarded them as\r\nindependent creatures and gave them the name that is still used at the\r\npresent time. Nitzsch, who also minutely studied these organisms and\r\nwho recognized the resemblance of the anterior part of their bodies\r\nto a _Fasciola_, did not, however, arrive at a correct conclusion.\r\nHe regarded the combination rather as that of a _Fasciola_ with a\r\n_Vibrio_, for which he mistook the characteristic tail of the cercaria.\r\nHe also noticed the encystment (transformation into the “pupa”) on\r\nforeign bodies of many species of these animals, but was of opinion\r\nthat this process signified only the termination of life.\r\n\r\nConsiderable attention was attracted to the matter when Bojanus first\r\npublished a paper entitled “A Short Note on Cercaria and their Place\r\nof Origin.” He pointed out that the cercariæ creep out of the “royal\r\nyellow worms,” which occur in freshwater snails (_Limnæa, Paludina_),\r\nand are probably generated in these worms.\r\n\r\nOken, in whose journal, _Isis_ (1818, p. 729), Bojanus published his\r\ndiscovery, remarks in an annotation, “One might lay a wager that these\r\nCercariæ are the embryos of Distomes.” Soon after (1827), C. E. v.\r\nBaer was able to confirm Bojanus’ hypothesis that the cercariæ as a\r\n“heterogeneous brood” originated from spores in parasitic tubes in\r\nsnails (germinating tubes). Moreover, Mehlis (_Isis_, 1831, p. 190)\r\nnot only discovered the opercula of the ova of _Distoma_, but likewise\r\nsaw the infusorian-like embryo emerge from the eggs of _Typhlocœlum_\r\n(_Monostomum_) _flavum_ and _Cathæmasia_ (_Distoma_) _hians_. A few\r\nyears later (1835) v. Siebold observed the embryos (miracidia) of\r\nthe _Cyclocœlum_ (_Monostomum_) _mutabile_, and discovered in their\r\ninterior a cylindrical body that behaved like an independent being\r\n(“necessary parasite”), and was so similar in appearance to the “royal\r\nyellow worms” (Bojanus) that Siebold considered the origin of the\r\nlatter from the embryos of trematodes as, at all events, possible.\r\nMeanwhile, v. Nordmann of Helsingfors had in 1832 seen the miracidia\r\nof flukes provided with eyes swimming in water; v. Siebold (1835)\r\nhad observed the embryos, or oncospheres, of tapeworms furnished\r\nwith six hooklets in the so-called eggs of the Tænia; while Creplin\r\n(1837) had discovered the “infusorial” young of the _Diphyllobothrium_\r\n(_Bothriocephalus_) _ditremum_, and conjectured that similar embryos\r\nwere to be found in other cestodes with operculated eggs. At all\r\nevents, the fact was established that the progeny of the helminthes\r\nappeared in various forms and was partly free living. The researches\r\nof Eschricht (1841) were likewise of influence, as they elucidated\r\nthe structure of the Bothriocephali, and proved that the encysted and\r\nsexless helminthes were merely immature stages.\r\n\r\nJ. I. Steenstrup (1842) was, however, the first to furnish explanations\r\nfor the numerous isolated and uncomprehended discoveries. Commencing\r\nwith the remarkable development of the Cœlenterata, he established the\r\nfact that the Helminthes, especially the endoparasitic trematodes,\r\nmultiply by means of alternating and differently formed generations.\r\nJust as the polyp originating from the egg of a medusa represents a\r\ngeneration of medusæ, so does the germinal tube (“royal yellow worm”)\r\noriginating from the ciliated embryo of a Distoma, etc., represent\r\nthe cercaria. These were consequently regarded as the progeny of\r\ntrematodes, and Steenstrup, guided by his observations, conjectured\r\nthat the cercaria, whose entrance into the snails he had observed\r\naccompanied by the simultaneous loss of the propelling tail, finally\r\npenetrated into other animals, in which they became flukes.\r\n\r\nPart of this hypothetical cycle of development was erroneous, and\r\nin other particulars positive observation was lacking, but the path\r\npursued was in the right direction. Immediately after the appearance of\r\nSteenstrup’s celebrated work, v. Siebold expressed his opinion that the\r\nencapsuled flukes certainly had to travel, _i.e._, to be transmitted\r\nwith their bearers into other hosts, before becoming mature. This view\r\nwas experimentally confirmed by de Filippi, La Valette St. George\r\n(1855), as well as by Pagenstecher (1857), while the metamorphosis of\r\nthe ciliated embryo of Distoma into a germinal tube was first seen by\r\nG. Wagener (1857) in _Gorgodera_ (_Distoma_) _cygnoides_ of frogs.\r\nAll that we have subsequently learned from the works of numerous\r\ninvestigators about the development of endoparasitic trematodes has\r\ncertainly increased our knowledge in various directions, and, apart\r\nfrom the deviating development of the _Holostomidæ_ has, as a whole,\r\nconfirmed the briefly sketched cycle of development.\r\n\r\nSteenstrup’s work on the cestodes did not attract the same attention\r\nas his work on trematodes. Steenstrup always insisted on the “nurse”\r\nnature of the cysticerci and other bladder-worms. Abildgaard (1790), as\r\nwell as Creplin (1829 and 1839), had already furnished the information\r\nthat certain sexless cestodes (_Schistocephalus_ and _Ligula_) from\r\nthe abdomen of fishes only become mature after their transference\r\nto the intestine of aquatic birds. These passive migrations were\r\nconfirmed in an entire series of other cestodes, particularly by v.\r\nSiebold (1844, 1848, 1850) and E. J. van Beneden (1849), not by actual\r\nexperiment, but by undoubted observation.\r\n\r\nIt was correctly believed that the ova or oncospheres penetrate into\r\ncertain intermediate hosts, in which they develop into unsegmented\r\nlarvæ. Here they remain until, with their host, they are swallowed by\r\nsome predacious animal. They then reach the intestine, being freed from\r\nthe surrounding membranes through the process of digestion, and settle\r\nthemselves there to form the adult chain of proglottides. Though some\r\nfew scientists, such as P. J. van Beneden and Em. Blanchard, deduced\r\nfrom these observations that the bladder-worms (Cysticerci), which had\r\nhitherto been regarded as a separate class of helminthes, were only\r\nlarval Tæniæ, this correct view was not at first universally accepted.\r\nThe foundation was too slight, and van Beneden was of opinion that the\r\nCysticerci were not necessary, but only appeared incidentally.\r\n\r\nv. Siebold was a strenuous opponent to this theory, notwithstanding\r\nhis experiences on the change of hosts of the Tetrarhynchus. Together\r\nwith Dujardin (1850) he conjectured that the Tæniæ underwent a\r\ndeviating cycle of development. He was of opinion that the six-hooked\r\noncospheres left the intestine, in which the older generation lived,\r\nand were scattered about with the fæces, and finally re-entered _per\r\nos_ (_i.e._, with water and food) a host similar to the one they\r\nhad left, in the intestine of which they were directly transformed\r\ninto tapeworms. A change of host such as occurred in other cestodes\r\nwas not supposed to take place (the history of the cestodes was\r\nat this time not entirely established). As the oncospheres of the\r\nTænia are enveloped in one calcareous or several softer coverings\r\nwhich they cannot leave actively, and as, in consequence of this\r\ncondition, innumerable oncospheres cannot penetrate into an animal,\r\nand others cannot reach the proper animal, v. Siebold conceded, at\r\nleast for the latter, the possibility of a further development. But\r\nthis was only supposed to occur because they had either invaded wrong\r\nhosts, or, having reached the right hosts, had penetrated organs\r\nunsuitable to their development, and had thus gone astray in their\r\ntravels, and had become hydropically degenerated tæniæ. This was v.\r\nSiebold’s explanation of bladder-worms. Naturally, v. Siebold himself\r\nconjectured that a recovery of the diseased tapeworm might occur, in a\r\nfew exceptional cases, after transmission into the correct host, as,\r\nfor instance, in the _Cysticercus fasciolaris_ of mice, the host of\r\nwhich is the domestic cat, and in which there is a seemingly normally\r\ndeveloped piece of tapeworm situated between the caudal vesicle and the\r\ncysticercus head.\r\n\r\nGuided by correct views, F. Küchenmeister undertook in Zittau the\r\ntask of confirming the metamorphosis of _Cysticercus pisiformis_ of\r\nhares and rabbits, into tapeworms in the intestine of the dog by means\r\nof feeding experiments. The first reports on the subject, published\r\nin 1851, were not likely to meet with universal approval, because\r\nKüchenmeister first diagnosed the actual tapeworm he had been rearing\r\nas _Tænia crassiceps_, afterwards as _Tænia serrata_, and finally as\r\n_Tænia pisiformis_ n. sp. However, in any case, Küchenmeister, by means\r\nof the reintroduction of experimental investigation, rendered a great\r\nservice to helminthology.\r\n\r\nThe publication of Küchenmeister’s works induced v. Siebold to\r\nundertake similar experiments (1852 and 1853), which were partly\r\npublished by his pupil Lewald in 1852. But the positive results\r\nobtained hardly changed Siebold’s opinion, for although he no longer\r\nconsidered the bladder-worms as hydropically degenerated tapeworms, he\r\nstill regarded them as tæniæ that had strayed. The change of opinion\r\nwas partly due to an important work of the Prague zoologist, v. Stein\r\n(1853). He was able to examine the development of a small bladder-worm\r\nin the larvæ of the well-known meal-worm (_Tenebrio molitor_) and\r\nto demonstrate that, as Goeze had already proved in the case of\r\n_Cysticercus fasciolaris_ of mice, first the caudal vesicle is formed\r\nand then the scolex, whereas Siebold believed that in bladder-worms the\r\nposterior end of the scolex was formed first, and that this posterior\r\nend underwent a secondary hydropic degeneration.\r\n\r\nIn opposition to v. Siebold, Küchenmeister successfully proved the\r\nnecessity of the bladder-worm stage by rearing tapeworms in dogs\r\nfrom the _Cysticercus tenuicollis_ of domestic mammals and from the\r\n_Cœnurus cerebralis_ of sheep. He, and simultaneously several other\r\ninvestigators independently, succeeded, with material provided by\r\nKüchenmeister, in rearing the _Cœnurus cerebralis_ in sheep from the\r\noncospheres of the _Tænia cœnurus_ of the dog (1854). R. Leuckart\r\nobtained similar results in mice by feeding them with the mature\r\nproglottides of the _Tænia crassicollis_ of cats (1854).\r\n\r\nKüchenmeister also repeatedly reared the _Tænia solium_ of man from\r\nthe _Cysticercus cellulosæ_ of pigs (1855), and from the embryos\r\nof this parasite P. J. van Beneden succeeded in obtaining the same\r\n_Cysticercus_ in the pig (1854). As Küchenmeister distinguished the\r\n_Tænia mediocanellata_, known to Goeze as _Tænia saginata_, amongst\r\nthe large tæniæ of man (1851), so it was not long before R. Leuckart\r\n(1862) succeeded in rearing the cysticercus of the hookless tapeworm\r\nin the ox. It is particularly to this last-named investigator that\r\nhelminthology is indebted more than to any other author. He followed\r\nthe gradual metamorphosis from oncospheres to cystic worms in all its\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\nIn view of all the researches that were made, and which are too\r\nnumerous to mention individually, the idea that bladder-worms are\r\nabnormal or only incidental forms had to be abandoned. Everything\r\npointed to the fact that in all cestodes the development is divided\r\nbetween two kinds of animals; in one--the host, the adult tapeworm is\r\nfound; while in the other, the intermediate host, we find some form or\r\nother of an intermediate stage (cysticercus in the broadest sense). The\r\npractical application of this knowledge is self-evident. If no infected\r\npork or beef is ingested, no tapeworm can be acquired, and also the\r\nrearing of cysticerci in the human body is prevented by avoiding the\r\nintroduction of the eggs of tapeworms.\r\n\r\nThough these results were definitely proved by numerous researches,\r\nyet they have been repeatedly challenged, notably by J. Knoch (1862)\r\nin Petrograd, who, on the basis of experiments, sought to confirm a\r\ndirect development without an intermediate host and ciliated stage,\r\nat all events as regards _Dibothriocephalus latus_. However, the\r\nrepeated communications of this author met with but little favour from\r\ncompetent persons, partly because the experiments were conducted very\r\ncarelessly, and partly because their repetition on dog and man (R.\r\nLeuckart) had no results (1863). It was only in 1883 that Braun was\r\nable to prove that the developmental cycle of _Dibothriocephalus latus_\r\nis similar to that of other Cestodes. The results obtained in other\r\nplaces by Parona, Grassi, Ijima and Zschokke render any discussion of\r\nKüchenmeister’s conclusions unnecessary.[7] Long after Knoch, a French\r\nauthor, P. Mégnin, also pleaded for the direct development of some\r\ncestodes, and especially some tæniæ. He (1879) also sought to prove a\r\ngenetic connection between the hookless and armed tapeworms of mammals,\r\nbut the arguments he adduced, so far as they rest on observations,\r\ncan be easily refuted or attributed to misinterpretation. Only one of\r\nthese arguments is correct, namely, that the number of the species\r\nof tæniæ with which we are acquainted is far larger than that of the\r\ncorresponding cystic forms; but this disparity alone cannot be taken as\r\na proof of direct development. It can only be said that our knowledge\r\nin this respect is deficient. As a matter of fact, we have during\r\nrecent years become acquainted with a large number of cystic forms,\r\nhitherto unknown, belonging to tæniæ which have long been familiar. It\r\nmust also be borne in mind that no man in his lifetime can complete\r\nan examination for bladder-worms of the large number of insects, for\r\ninstance, which may destroy an entire generation of an insectivorous\r\nspecies of bird within a small district.\r\n\r\n[7] Refer to the collected literature under _Dibothriocephalus latus_,\r\nand the reply to Küchenmeister by Braun (“Ueber den Zwischenwirt des\r\nbreit. Bandw.” Würzb.: Stuber, 1886).\r\n\r\nNaturally it does not follow that direct development in the cestodes\r\nis altogether lacking. The researches of Grassi (1889) have furnished\r\nan example in _Hymenolepis_ (_Tænia_) _murina_, which shows that\r\ndevelopment may sometimes take place without an intermediate host,\r\nnotwithstanding the retention of the cystic stage. It was found that\r\nthe oncospheres of this species, introduced into rats of a certain age,\r\nafter a time grow into tapeworms without leaving the intestine, but not\r\ndirectly, for they bore into the intestinal wall, where they pass the\r\ncystic stage, the cysts afterwards falling into the intestinal lumen,\r\nwhere they develop into tapeworms. The recent experiments of Nicoll\r\n(1911) show that the larval stages of _Hymenolepis murina_ also occur\r\nin the rat-flea, _Ceratophyllus fasciatus_.\r\n\r\nImportant observations were soon made on the remaining groups of\r\nhelminthes. The discussion on the origin of parasites soon became\r\nconfined to the helminthes. Amongst the Nematoda, it had long been\r\nknown that encapsuled forms existed that had at first been regarded as\r\nindependent species, but very soon they were pronounced to be immature\r\nforms, in consequence of their lack of sexual organs. Though Dujardin\r\nand also v. Siebold regarded them as “strayed” animals, v. Stein (1853)\r\nvery promptly demonstrated that the progeny of the nematodes were\r\ndestined to travel by discovering a perforating organ in the larval\r\nnematodes of the mealworm. This was first experimentally confirmed\r\n(1860) by R. Leuckart, R. Virchow and Zenker, all of whom succeeded not\r\nonly in bringing to maturity the muscle Trichinæ (known since 1830) in\r\nthe intestine of the animals experimented upon, but were likewise able\r\nto follow the migrations of the progeny. Of course, the encapsulating\r\nbrood remained in the same organism, and in this respect deviated\r\nfrom the broods of other helminthes which escape into the outer world\r\nand find their way into other animals, but the encapsuled nematodes\r\ncould no longer be regarded as the result of straying. Subsequently,\r\nR. Leuckart worked out, more or less completely, the history of the\r\ndevelopment of numerous nematodes, or pointed out the way in which\r\nfurther investigations should be made. It has been found that in\r\nnematodes far more frequently than in other helminthes, the typical\r\ncourse of development is subject partly to curtailment and partly to\r\ncomplications, which sometimes considerably increase the difficulties\r\nof investigation and have hitherto prevented the attainment of a\r\ndefinite conclusion, though the way to it is now clear.\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner the works of R. Leuckart have cleared up the\r\ndevelopment of the _Acanthocephala_ and _Linguatulida_. Of course,\r\nmuch still remains to be done. So far, we do not even know all the\r\nhelminthes of man and of the domestic animals in all their phases\r\nof life, and still less is known of those of other animals. We are\r\nindebted to the discoveries of the last fifty years for the knowledge\r\narrived at, though comparatively few names are connected with it. The\r\ngross framework is revealed, but the gaps have only been filled up here\r\nand there. However, we may trustfully leave the completion of the whole\r\nto the future, without fear that any essential alterations will take\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThe deductions to be drawn are as follows: That the helminthes like\r\nthe ectoparasites multiply by sexual processes, that the entire course\r\nof development of the helminthes is rarely or never gone through in\r\nthe same host as is the case with several ectoparasites, that the\r\nprogeny at an earlier or later stage of development, as eggs, embryos,\r\nor larvæ, quit the host inhabited by the older generation, and\r\nalmost always attain the outer world: only in _Trichinella_ does the\r\ndevelopment take place directly in the definite host. Where the eggs\r\nhave not yet developed they go through the embryonic evolution in the\r\nouter world. The young larvæ are transmitted, either still enclosed\r\nwithin the egg or embryonic covering, to the intermediate host or\r\nmore rarely they are transferred straight to the final host. In other\r\ncases they may hatch out from their envelopes, and after a longer or\r\nshorter period of free life, during which they may partake of food\r\nand grow, they, as before, penetrate, usually in an active way, into\r\nan intermediate host, or at once invade the final host. Exceptionally\r\n(_e.g._, _Rhabdonema_), during the free life there may be a propagation\r\nof the parasitic generation, and in this case only the succeeding\r\ngeneration again becomes parasitic, and then at once reaches its final\r\nhost. The young forms which have invaded the final host become mature\r\nin the latter, or after a longer or shorter period of parasitism again\r\nwander forth (as the Œstridæ, Ichneumonidæ, etc.), and reach the adult\r\nstage in the outer world. The young stages, during which the parasites\r\nundergo metamorphoses or are even capable of producing one or several\r\nintermediate generations, are passed in the intermediate hosts until,\r\nas a rule, they are passively carried into the final host and there\r\ncomplete their cycle of development by the formation of the organs\r\nof generation. This mode of development, the spending of life in two\r\ndifferent kinds of animals (intermediate and final host), is typical of\r\nthe helminthes. This is manifested in the Acanthocephala, the Cestoda,\r\nthe majority of the endoparasitic Trematoda, a number of the Nematoda,\r\nand the Linguatulidæ. There are now and then exceptions, however,\r\nin which, for instance, the host and intermediate host change order\r\n(_Trichinella_, _Hymenolepis murina_).\r\n\r\nParasites are hardly ever inherited amongst animals.[8] According to a\r\nfew statements, however, _Trichinella_ and _Cœnurus_ are supposed to\r\nbe transmissible from the infected mother to the fœtus. Otherwise most\r\nanimals acquire their parasites, especially the Entozoa, from without,\r\nthe parasites penetrating either actively, as in animals living in the\r\nwater, or passively with food and drink. A particular predisposition to\r\nworms is not more likely than a spontaneous origin of parasites.\r\n\r\n[8] However, in the Protozoa there are examples of hereditary\r\ntransmission of parasites, _e.g._, in the case of _Babesia_\r\n(_Piroplasma_) _bovis_ and _Babesia canis_ in their invertebrate hosts\r\n(ticks); in _Crithidia melophagia_ and _Crithidia hyalommæ_; and in the\r\ncase of _Spirochæta duttoni_ in its invertebrate host (a tick).\r\n\r\n_Derivation of Parasites._--Doubt now no longer exists as to the\r\nderivation of the temporary and of many of the stationary ectoparasites\r\nfrom free-living forms. This conclusion is founded on the circumstance\r\nthat not only are there numerous intermediate degrees in the manner of\r\nliving and feeding between predacious and parasitic animals, but that\r\nthere is more or less uniformity in their structure. The differences\r\nthat exist are easily explained as consequences of altered conditions\r\nof life. The case is more difficult in regard to groups that are\r\nexclusively parasitic (_Cestoda_, _Trematoda_, _Acanthocephala_,\r\n_Linguatulidæ_, and _Sporozoa_), or groups that are chiefly parasitic\r\n(_Nematoda_), because in these cases the gulf that divides these\r\nforms from free-living animals is wider. It is true that we know\r\nthat the nearest relatives of the _Linguatulidæ_ are found amongst\r\nthe _Arachnoidea_, and indeed in the _Acarina_; that, moreover,\r\nthe structure and development of the _Sporozoa_ refers them to the\r\n_Protozoa_, and allows some of them to be regarded as the descendants\r\nof the lowest _Rhizopoda_. We know that the _Trematoda_, and through\r\nthese the _Cestoda_, are closely related to the _Turbellaria_,\r\nfrom which they may be traced. The _Nematoda_, and still more the\r\n_Acanthocephala_, stand apart. This is less evident, however, in the\r\nNematoda, for there are numerous free-living members of these from\r\nwhich it is possible that the parasitic species may be descended.\r\nIndeed, this seems more than probable if such examples as _Leptodera_,\r\n_Rhabdonema_ and _Strongyloides_ are taken into consideration, as well\r\nas the conditions of life of free-living nematodes. These mostly, if\r\nnot exclusively, spend their lives in places where decomposing organic\r\nsubstances are present in quantities; some species attain maturity\r\nonly in such localities, and there propagate very rapidly. Should the\r\nfavourable conditions for feeding be changed, the animals seek out\r\nother localities, or they remain in the larval form for some time until\r\nmore favourable conditions set in. It is comprehensible that such forms\r\nare very likely to adopt a parasitic manner of life which at first is\r\nfacultative (_Leptodera_, _Anguillula_), but may be regarded as the\r\ntransition to true parasitism. The great advantages attached to a\r\nparasitic life consist not only in protection, but also in the supply\r\nof suitable food, and consequently in the easier and greater production\r\nof eggs, and thus fully account for the gradual passage of facultative\r\nparasitism into true parasitism. In many forms the young stages live\r\nfree for some time (_Strongylidæ_), in others, as is the case in\r\n_Rhabdonema_, parasitic and free-living generations alternate; in\r\nothers, again, the free period is limited to the egg stage or entirely\r\nsuppressed.\r\n\r\nThough it is possible thus to connect the parasitic with the\r\nfree-living nematodes, by taking their manner of life into account,\r\nthis matter presents greater difficulties in regard to other\r\nhelminthes. It is true that the segmented Cestoda may be connected with\r\nand traced from the less known and interesting single-jointed Cestoda\r\n(_Amphilina_, _Archigetes_, _Caryophyllæus_, _Gyrocotyle_). Trematodes\r\nare all parasites, with the exception of one group, _Temnocephalidæ_,\r\nseveral genera and species of which live on the surface of the bodies\r\nof Crustacea and turtles of tropical and sub-tropical freshwaters.\r\n_Temnocephalidæ_ are, nevertheless, predacious. They feed on Infusoria,\r\nthe larvæ of small insects and Crustacea. So far as is known they do\r\nnot nourish themselves on part of the host. They belong to the group\r\nof commensals, or more correctly, to that of the SPACE PARASITES,\r\nwhich simply dwell with their host and do not even take a portion of\r\nthe superfluity of its food. However, space parasitism may still be\r\nregarded as the first stage of commensalism, which is again to be\r\nregarded as a sort of transition to true parasitism.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that parasitism came about in this way in the\r\ntrematodes, in which connection we must first consider the\r\nturbellaria-like ancestors of the trematodes. Much can be said\r\nin favour of such a genetic relationship between turbellaria and\r\ntrematodes, and hardly anything against it. It should also be\r\nremembered that amongst the few parasitic turbellaria there are some\r\nthat possess clinging discs or suctorial pores, and these are only\r\ndifferentiated from ectoparasitic trematodes by the possession of a\r\nciliated integument, which is found only in the larval stages of the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nThe Acanthocephala occupy an isolated position. Most authors certainly\r\nregard them as related to the nematodes; in any case, the connection\r\nis not a close one, and the far-reaching alterations which must have\r\noccurred prevent a clear view. Perhaps the free original forms of\r\nAcanthocephala are no longer in existence, but that such must have\r\nexisted is a foregone conclusion.\r\n\r\nAn explanation of the CHANGE OF HOST so frequent in parasites is more\r\ndifficult than that of their descent. R. Leuckart is of opinion that\r\nthe present intermediate hosts, which belong principally to the lower\r\nanimals, were the original hosts of the parasites, and fostered both\r\ntheir larval and adult stages. It was only in course of time that the\r\noriginal hosts sank to the position of intermediate hosts, the cause\r\nfor this alteration being that the development of parasites, especially\r\nof the helminthes, through further development and differentiation\r\nextended over a larger number of stages. The earlier stages remained\r\nin their original hosts, but the later stages sought out other hosts\r\n(higher animals). To prove this, Leuckart points out that the mature\r\nstages of the helminthes, with but few exceptions, occur only in the\r\nvertebrates which appeared later in the development of the animal\r\nkingdom, while the great majority of intestinal worms of the lower\r\nanimals only represent young stages, which require transmission\r\ninto a vertebrate animal before they can become mature. The few\r\nhelminthes that attain maturity in the lower animals (_Aspidogaster_,\r\n_Archigetes_) are therefore regarded by Leuckart as primitive forms,\r\nand he compares them with the developmental stages of helminthes,\r\n_Aspidogaster_ with rediæ, _Archigetes_ with cysticercoids. He\r\nclasses the nematodes that become mature in the invertebrates with\r\n_Anguillulidæ_, _i.e._, with saprophagous nematodes from which the\r\nparasitic species descend.\r\n\r\nLeuckart therefore regards the change of hosts as secondary, so does\r\nSabatier. The latter, however, adduces other reasons for this (lack of\r\nclinging organs and the necessity to develop them in an intermediary\r\nstage); but in this connection he only considers the Cestoda. In\r\nopposition to Leuckart, R. Moniez, however, is convinced that the\r\nmigrations of the helminthes, as well as the system of intermediate\r\nhosts, represent the original order of things. Moniez traces all\r\nEntozoa from saprophytes, but only a few of these were able to settle\r\ndirectly in the intestine and there continue their development. These\r\nare forms that at the present day still lack an intermediate host,\r\nsuch as _Trichocephalus_, _Ascaris_, and _Oxyuris_. In most other\r\ncases the embryos, however, consisted of such saprophytes as were, in\r\nother respects, suitable to become parasites, but were incapable of\r\nresisting the mechanical and chemical influences of the intestinal\r\ncontents. They were therefore obliged to leave the intestine at once,\r\nand accomplished this by penetrating the intestinal walls and burrowing\r\nin the tissues of their carriers. In this position, assisted by the\r\nfavourable conditions of nutrition, they could attain a relatively high\r\ndegree of development. Mechanical reasons prevented a return to the\r\nintestines, where the eggs could be deposited. Most of them doubtless\r\ndied off as parasites, as also their young stages do at present when\r\nthey penetrate wrong hosts. Some of them, nevertheless, passively\r\nreached the intestine of beasts of prey. Many were destroyed in the\r\nprocess of mastication; for a small part, however, there was the\r\nchance of reaching the intestine of a beast of prey undamaged, and\r\nthere, having become larger and more capable of resistance, maturity\r\nwas attained. By means of this incidental coincidence of various\r\nfavourable circumstances, these processes, according to Moniez, have\r\nbeen established by heredity and have become normal.\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to express an opinion either for or against the\r\nvarious hypotheses advanced, but the existence of these diametrically\r\nopposed views alone will show the great difficulty of the question.\r\nIndependently, however, it appears more natural to come to the\r\nconclusion that parasitism, as well as change of hosts, were gradual\r\ntransitions.\r\n\r\nAs a conclusion to this introductory chapter, a list of some of the\r\nmost important works on the parasitology of man and animals is appended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  GOEZE, J. A. E.

These animals either live on\r\n  the external surface of the body or within the intestine and its\r\n  appendages. Other organs and systems are not quite free from foreign\r\n  organisms--we are acquainted with parasites in the skeletal system,\r\n  in the circulatory system, in the brain, in the muscles, in the\r\n  excretory and genital organs, and even in the organs of sense.\r\n\r\n  It is possible, and perhaps might be advantageous, to arrange and\r\n  describe the parasites of man according to the situations in which\r\n  they are found (parasites of the skin, intestinal parasites, etc.).\r\n  Their description in the various stages of development would,\r\n  however, be disturbed when, as is generally the case, the different\r\n  stages are passed in different organs, and a work which treats more\r\n  fully of the natural history of the parasites than of the local\r\n  disorders to which they give rise would suffer thereby. It is,\r\n  therefore, preferable to describe the parasites of man in their\r\n  systematic order, and to mention their different situations in man in\r\n  describing each species.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. *PROTOZOA*,\r\n\r\nBY\r\n\r\nH. B. FANTHAM, M.A., D.Sc.\r\n\r\n  All those animal organisms which throughout their entire life never\r\n  rise above the unicellular stage, or merely form simple, loose\r\n  colonies of similar unicellular animals, are grouped under the term\r\n  _Protozoa_ (Goldfuss, 1820), as the simplest types of animal life.\r\n  All the vital functions of these, the lowest forms of animals, are\r\n  carried out by their body substance, the protoplasm (sarcode). Often\r\n  particular parts possess special functions, but the limits of a cell\r\n  are never over-stepped thereby. These special parts of the cell are\r\n  called “cell-organs”; recently they have been termed “organellæ.”\r\n\r\n  The living protoplasm has the appearance of a finely granular, viscid\r\n  substance which, as a rule, when not surrounded by dense investing\r\n  membranes or skeletons, exhibits a distinct kind of movement, which\r\n  has been termed amœboid. According to the species, processes of\r\n  different forms and varying numbers called pseudopodia are protruded\r\n  and withdrawn, and with their assistance these tiny organisms glide\r\n  along--it might almost be said flow along--over the surface. In most\r\n  Protozoa two layers of cytoplasm may be recognised, and distinguished\r\n  by their appearance and structure, namely, the superficially\r\n  situated, viscid, and quite hyaline ectosarc or ectoplasm, and the\r\n  more fluid and always granular endosarc or endoplasm, which is\r\n  entirely enveloped by the ectoplasm. The two layers have different\r\n  functions; the movements originate from the ectoplasm, which also\r\n  undoubtedly fulfils the functions of breathing, introduction of food\r\n  and excretion. The endoplasm, which in some forms (Radiolaria) is\r\n  separated from the ectoplasm by a membrane, undertakes the digestion\r\n  of the food. To this distribution of functions between the various\r\n  layers of cytoplasm is due the development of particular cellular\r\n  organs, such as the appearance of cilia, flagella, suctorial tubules\r\n  (in the Suctoria) and the myophan striations, which are contractile\r\n  parts of the ectoplasm in Infusoria and Gregarines. In many cases\r\n  (Flagellata, Ciliata), an area is differentiated for the ingestion of\r\n  food (oral part, cytostome) to which there is often added a straight\r\n  or curved opening (cytopharynx), through which the food reaches the\r\n  endoplasm. The indigestible residue is either cast off through the\r\n  oral part or excreted by a special anal part (cytopyge). In rare\r\n  cases, structures sensitive to light, the so-called pigment or eye\r\n  spots are developed, _e.g._, _Euglena_. In the case of Infusoria\r\n  the endoplasm circulates slowly, and agglomerations of fluids (food\r\n  vacuoles) sometimes appear around each bolus of food; in these\r\n  vacuoles the food is digested under the action of certain materials\r\n  (ferments). Even in the lowliest Protozoa fluids to be excreted are,\r\n  as a rule, gathered into one, or, more rarely, several contractile\r\n  vacuoles, which regularly discharge their contents. This action,\r\n  however, is to a certain extent governed by the temperature of the\r\n  surrounding medium. In some Infusoria a tube-like channel in the\r\n  cytoplasm is joined to the contractile vacuole which usually occupies\r\n  a certain position; this forms a sort of excretory duct, and there\r\n  are also supply-canals leading to these organellæ.\r\n\r\n  Very frequently various substances are deposited in the endoplasm,\r\n  such as fatty granules, drops of oil, pigment granules, bubbles of\r\n  gas or crystals. More solid skeletal substances are secreted in or\r\n  on the ectoplasm. To the latter belong the cuticle of the Sporozoa\r\n  and Infusoria, the chalky shells containing one or several chambers\r\n  of the Foraminifera, the siliceous and very ornamental framework\r\n  of the Radiolaria, and the chitinous coat of many Flagellata,\r\n  Infusoria, etc. Some forms make use of foreign bodies found in their\r\n  surroundings, such as grains of sand, to construct their protective\r\n  coverings.\r\n\r\n  The food often consists of small animal or vegetable organisms and of\r\n  organic waste; it is usually introduced _in toto_ into the endoplasm.\r\n  On the other hand, the Suctoria extract nourishment from their prey\r\n  by means of their tentacles. Many parasitic species also ingest solid\r\n  food, others feed by endosmosis.\r\n\r\n  In all cases one nucleus at least is present. It is true that the\r\n  existence of non-nucleated Protozoa, the so-called _Monera_, is\r\n  still insisted upon, but some of these have already proved to be\r\n  nucleated, and the presence of nuclei in the others will no doubt be\r\n  established. Very often the number of nuclei increases considerably,\r\n  but these multinucleate stages are always preceded by uninucleate\r\n  stages. In the Infusoria, in addition to the larger or principal\r\n  nucleus (macronucleus) there is usually a smaller reproductive\r\n  nucleus (micronucleus). This dualism of the nuclear apparatus is\r\n  considered by some to be general, and usually to appear first at the\r\n  onset of reproduction.\r\n\r\n  The form and structure of the nucleus vary greatly in different\r\n  species. There are elongate, kidney-shaped, or even branched nuclei\r\n  as well as spherical or oval ones. In addition to vesicular nuclei\r\n  with a distinct karyosome and incidentally also with a nuclear\r\n  membrane, homogeneous and more solid formations are frequently\r\n  encountered. The nuclei are always differentiated from the protoplasm\r\n  by their reactions, particularly in regard to certain stains.\r\n\r\n  In many Protozoa an extra-nuclear mass, sometimes compact, sometimes\r\n  diffuse, arises from or near the nucleus. This mass, whose staining\r\n  reactions resemble those of the nucleus, is termed the chromidial\r\n  apparatus. On the dualistic hypothesis, two varieties of chromidia\r\n  occur, one originating from the vegetative nucleus (macronucleus),\r\n  being chromidia in the restricted sense, the other derived from the\r\n  reproductive or micronucleus being termed sporetia. Chromidia consist\r\n  of altered (? katabolic) nuclear material.\r\n\r\n  The nucleus plays the same part in the life of the single celled\r\n  organisms as it does in the cells of the Metazoa and Metaphyta. It\r\n  appears to influence in a certain manner all, or at least most,\r\n  of the processes of life, such as motility, regeneration, growth,\r\n  and generally also digestion. Its principal influence, however, is\r\n  exercised in the propagation of the cells, as this is always brought\r\n  about by the nucleus.\r\n\r\n  The PROPAGATION of the Protozoa is effected either by division or by\r\n  means of direct budding. In division, which is preceded by direct\r\n  or indirect (mitotic) division of the nucleus, the body separates\r\n  into two, several, or even a great many segments. In this process\r\n  the entire substance of the body is involved, or a small residual\r\n  fragment may be left, which does not undergo further division\r\n  and finally perishes. In the budding method of multiplication a\r\n  large number of buds are formed, either on the surface or in the\r\n  interior of the organism. Where divisions or buddings follow one\r\n  another rapidly, without the segments separating immediately after\r\n  their production, numerous forms develop, which are often unlike\r\n  the parental forms, and these are termed swarm spores or spores.\r\n  Divisions imperfectly accomplished lead to the formation of protozoal\r\n  colonies.\r\n\r\n  Sometimes encystment[9] takes place previous to division.\r\n  Frequently, also, sexual processes appear, such as the union of\r\n  two similar (isogamous) or dissimilar (anisogamous) individuals.\r\n  In the latter case sexual dimorphism occurs, with the formation of\r\n  males (microgametes) and of females (macrogametes). The union may\r\n  be permanent (copulation), the process being comparable with the\r\n  fertilisation of the ovum by a spermatozoon. On the other hand,\r\n  attachment may be transient (conjugation) when, after the exchange\r\n  of portions of the nucleus, the couple separate, to multiply\r\n  independently of each other. Sometimes there is an ALTERNATION OF\r\n  GENERATIONS, as there may be several methods of propagation combined\r\n  in the same species, either direct multiplication, conjugation, or\r\n  copulation being practised; the different generations may thus, in\r\n  certain cases, be unlike morphologically.\r\n\r\n[9] Independently of propagation, many protozoa protect themselves from\r\ndeath by encystment when the water in which they are living dries up;\r\nin this condition the wind may carry them over wide tracts of land.\r\n\r\n  Protozoa inhabit salt water as well as fresh water; they are also\r\n  found on land in very damp places, and invade animals as parasites.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF THE PROTOZOA.\r\n\r\n  _Class I._--*Sarcodina* (_Rhizopoda_). Protozoa, the body substance\r\n  of which forms pseudopodia; many of them are capable of developing\r\n  chitinous, chalky, or siliceous coverings or skeletal structures,\r\n  which, however, permit the protrusion of the pseudopodia either over\r\n  the entire periphery or at certain points. They possess one nucleus\r\n  or several.\r\n\r\n      _Order 1._--_Amœbina_ (Lobosa) naked or with a simple shell,\r\n      sometimes formed of a foreign substance; the pseudopodia may be\r\n      lobose or finger-shaped; there may be a contractile vacuole;\r\n      generally only one nucleus. They live in fresh or salt water, in\r\n      the soil, and also parasitically.\r\n\r\n      _Order 2._--_Foraminifera_ (Reticularia). Mostly provided with\r\n      a calcareous shell, usually consisting of several chambers,\r\n      and allowing the protrusion of the pseudopodia either at the\r\n      periphery or only at the opening. The pseudopodia are filamentous\r\n      and frequently anastomosed; there is no contractile vacuole;\r\n      there are usually several nuclei. Mostly marine.\r\n\r\n      _Order 3._--_Heliozoa._ Naked, or with a chitinous or simple\r\n      radial siliceous skeleton; the pseudopodia are filamentous,\r\n      and are frequently supported by firmer axes, which exhibit no\r\n      tendency to anastomosis; there is a contractile vacuole; one or\r\n      several nuclei. Live in fresh water.\r\n\r\n      _Order 4._--_Radiolaria_. The body has radially-disposed\r\n      filamentous pseudopodia, and the nucleus is hidden in the central\r\n      capsule; there is almost always a siliceous framework, consisting\r\n      of pieces arranged radially, tangentially, or lattice-like; there\r\n      is no contractile vacuole, but fluid-containing hydrostatic\r\n      vacuoles are present in the peripheral protoplasm. Marine.\r\n\r\n  _Class II._--*Mastigophora* (_Flagellata_). Protozoa with one or\r\n  several long flagella used for locomotion and for acquiring food; in\r\n  stationary forms their only function is to take in food. Cytostome and\r\n  contractile vacuole may be present. May be either naked or provided\r\n  with protective coverings; one or more nuclei. They live either in\r\n  fresh or salt water, or may be parasitic.\r\n\r\n  This class is again divided into several sub-classes and orders, of\r\n  which only the Euflagellata, with the Protomonadina and Polymastigoda\r\n  are of interest here.\r\n\r\n  _Class III._--*Sporozoa.* Protozoa that only live parasitically in the\r\n  cells, tissues, or organs of other animals. They ingest liquid food\r\n  by osmosis; the surface of the body is covered with an ectoplasmic\r\n  layer, or cuticle; they have no cilia in the adult state, but may\r\n  form pseudopodia. Flagella occur, but only on the male propagating\r\n  individuals. There may be one or numerous nuclei, but no contractile\r\n  vacuole. Propagation by means of spores, mostly provided with\r\n  sporocysts, is characteristic.\r\n\r\n    _Sub-class_ 1.--*Telosporidia.* These are usually of constant form,\r\n    rarely amœboid; they are uninucleate in the mature state; they live\r\n    within host cells in the first stage. Spore-formation occurs at the\r\n    end of the life-cycle.\r\n\r\n      _Order 1._--_Gregarinida._ Body of a constant, usually elongate\r\n      form, surrounded by a cuticle. In the early stage they lead an\r\n      intracellular existence; in the mature stage they live within the\r\n      intestine or body cavity of invertebrate animals, especially the\r\n      Arthropoda, and, like intestinal parasites, are provided with\r\n      clinging organs. Copulation usually isogamous; the spores have\r\n      coats (chlamydospores) and usually contain several minute germs\r\n      (sporozoites).\r\n\r\n      _Order 2._--_Coccidiidea._ Body of uniform spherical or oval\r\n      shape: they lead an intracellular life, but are not freely motile\r\n      in cavities of the body. Fertilization is anisogamous; the spores\r\n      have coats or shells (sporocysts), and usually contain several\r\n      sporozoites. Exhibit alternation of generations.\r\n\r\n      _Order 3._--_Hæmosporidia._ Parasites of the blood corpuscles of\r\n      vertebrate animals; they exhibit amœboid movement; fertilization\r\n      is anisogamous; many present alternation of generations and hosts;\r\n      spores naked.\r\n\r\n    _Sub-class 2._--*Neosporidia.* They are multinucleate when adult,\r\n    and the form of the body varies exceedingly (often amœboid);\r\n    spore-formation commences before the completion of growth.\r\n\r\n      _Order 1._--_Myxosporidia._ The spores have valvular coats,\r\n      with or without caudal appendages, with two, rarely four, polar\r\n      capsules. They live free in such organs as the gall or urinary\r\n      bladder, but are chiefly found in connective tissue. They occur\r\n      especially in fishes.\r\n\r\n      _Order 2._--_Microsporidia._ Spores with coats or sporocysts; no\r\n      caudal appendage, with one polar capsule. They usually live in\r\n      the tissues of Arthropoda.\r\n\r\n      _Order 3._--_Sarcosporidia._ Elongate parasites of the muscular\r\n      fibres of amniotic vertebrates, on rare occasions they occur\r\n      also in the connective tissue; the spores, which are kidney or\r\n      sickle-shaped, are naked and apparently have no obvious polar\r\n      capsule.\r\n\r\n      _Order 4._--_Haplosporidia._ Simple organisms, forming simple\r\n      spores; they occur in Rotifers, Polychætes, Fish and Man.\r\n\r\n  _Class IV._--*Infusoria* (_Ciliata_). The body is generally uniform\r\n  in shape, with cilia and contractile vacuole, frequently also with\r\n  cytostome; usually has macro- and micro-nucleus; live free in water\r\n  and also parasitically.\r\n\r\n  The orders _Holotricha_, _Heterotricha_, _Oligotricha_, _Hypotricha_\r\n  and _Peritricha_ are classified according to the arrangement of the\r\n  cilia.\r\n\r\n  _Class V._--*Suctoria.* Bodies with suctorial tubes, contractile\r\n  vacuoles, macro- and micro-nucleus, no cytostome. They generally\r\n  invade aquatic animals as cavity parasites, yet also attack plants;\r\n  early stage ciliated. Live sometimes as parasites on Infusoria. [The\r\n  Suctoria are frequently regarded as a sub-class of the Infusoria.]\r\n\r\n  The Protozoa and Protophyta are sometimes united under the term\r\n  _Protista_ (Haeckel, 1866). The Spirochætes are Protists (see\r\n  pp. 114–128).\r\n\r\n\r\nClass I. *SARCODINA*, Bütschli, 1882.\r\n\r\nOrder. *Amœbina*, Ehrenberg.\r\n\r\nA. *Human Intestinal Amœbæ.*\r\n\r\n  The first record of the occurrence of amœba-like organisms in the\r\n  human intestine, that is, in intestinal evacuations, was that of\r\n  Lambl (1859); nevertheless, the case was not quite conclusive,\r\n  as the occurrence of testaceous amœbæ of fresh water (_Arcella_,\r\n  _Difflugia_) was also reported. In 1870 Lewis found amœbæ associated\r\n  with disorders of the large intestine in patients in Calcutta. A year\r\n  later Cunningham reported from the same locality that he had observed\r\n  on eighteen occasions, in one hundred examinations of dejecta from\r\n  cholera patients, colourless bodies with amœboid movements, which\r\n  became encysted and multiplied by fission. The daughter forms were\r\n  said to be capable of dividing again, but they might also remain\r\n  in contact. Contractile vacuoles were not noticed. The same bodies\r\n  were observed also in simple diarrhœa (twenty-eight cases out of one\r\n  hundred.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--_Amœba coli_, Lösch, in the intestinal mucus.\r\n(After Lösch.)]\r\n\r\n  The case reported by Lösch in 1875 attracted more attention. It was\r\n  that of a peasant, aged 24, who came from the province of Archangel.\r\n  He was admitted into Eichwald’s clinic at Petrograd with symptoms\r\n  of dysentery. In the discharges containing blood and pus, Lösch\r\n  found amœbæ in large numbers. When at rest these amœbæ measured from\r\n  20 µ to 35 µ; in a state of movement their length might extend up\r\n  to 60 µ (fig. 1). The pseudopodia appeared only singly, and, since\r\n  they were hyaline (ectoplasmic), were thus distinguished from the\r\n  markedly granular endoplasm that enclosed a spherical nucleus of from\r\n  5 µ to 7 µ in diameter. One or more non-contractile vacuoles were\r\n  present. Quinine enemata had the effect of making the amœbæ disappear\r\n  from the fæces and thus causing the diarrhœa to abate. Four months\r\n  after admission the patient died from the results of intercurrent\r\n  pneumonia. At the autopsy ulceration of the large intestine was\r\n  found, especially in the lower parts. Lösch connected the amœbæ with\r\n  the ulcerations by experiments made on four dogs by injecting them\r\n  with recently passed stools (_per os et anum_). Eight days after the\r\n  last injection numerous amœbæ were found in the fæces of one of these\r\n  dogs; eighteen days after the injection the animal was killed. The\r\n  mucosa of the rectum was inflamed, covered with blood-stained mucus\r\n  and ulcerated in three places. Numbers of amœbæ were found both in\r\n  the pus of the ulcers and in the mucus. The three other dogs remained\r\n  healthy. From these observations Lösch concluded that the species of\r\n  amœba described by him as _Amœba coli_ could not be regarded as the\r\n  primary cause of the disease, but that it was certainly capable of\r\n  increasing a lesion of the large intestine already present, or at\r\n  least of preventing its healing.\r\n\r\n  B. Grassi (1879) found in the stools of healthy as well as in those\r\n  of diarrhœic patients from various localities in Northern Italy,\r\n  amœbæ similar to those discovered by Lösch. As this was of frequent\r\n  occurrence, the pathogenicity could not be definitely established.\r\n  Normand, formerly naval surgeon at Hong-Kong, observed numerous amœbæ\r\n  in the dejecta of two patients suffering from colitis.\r\n\r\n  Many further investigations, which cannot be quoted in detail, showed\r\n  not only that intestinal amœbæ were widely distributed in man, but\r\n  indicated with greater certainty their rôle as agents of dysentery.\r\n  The Commission sent out by the German Government in the year 1883\r\n  to investigate cholera in India and Egypt--whose members discovered\r\n  the cholera bacillus--also collected information with regard to\r\n  dysentery. In five cases of dysentery examined _post mortem_ at\r\n  Alexandria, with the exception of one case in which ulceration of the\r\n  colon had already cicatrized or was approaching cicatrization, R.\r\n  Koch found amœbæ as well as bacteria in sections from the base of the\r\n  ulcers, although such had previously escaped notice in examination of\r\n  the dejecta. Encouraged by these results, Kartulis (1885), who had\r\n  discovered amœba-like bodies in the stools of patients suffering from\r\n  intestinal complaints at Alexandria, continued his investigations.\r\n  The results, obtained from more than 500 cases, gave rise to the\r\n  theory that typical dysentery was caused by amœbæ as were also the\r\n  liver-abscesses that often accompany it. Kartulis supported his\r\n  theory not only by the regular occurrence of amœbæ in the stools\r\n  of dysenteric patients and their absence in other diseases, and by\r\n  the occurrence of the parasites in ulcers of the large intestine\r\n  and in the pus from liver-abscesses, but also by experiments which\r\n  he performed on cats. These were infected by injection _per anum_\r\n  of stool material rich in amœbæ from subjects of dysentery. The\r\n  infection took place also when amœba-containing, but bacteria-free,\r\n  pus from liver-abscesses was used. It has been objected that the\r\n  infection of man with _Amœba coli_, as the dysenteric amœbæ were then\r\n  generally designated, does not take place _per anum_ but _per os_.\r\n  This difficulty, however, diminished in proportion as the encysted\r\n  states of amœbæ (fig. 2), long known in the case of other Protozoa,\r\n  became understood. The infection of man (Calandruccio, 1890) and of\r\n  cats (Quincke and Roos) succeeded solely when material containing\r\n  such stages was used. Amœbæ introduced into the intestine multiply\r\n  there by fission (Harris, 1894). However, this theory, to which\r\n  various other authors gave support on the grounds of their own\r\n  observations, encountered opposition. Thus it was established that\r\n  amœbæ were not found in patients in every place where dysentery was\r\n  endemic, or else they were much rarer than was expected. Further,\r\n  amœbæ were present in the most varied kinds of intestinal diseases,\r\n  both of infective and non-infective characters. Also they were\r\n  present in quite healthy persons.\r\n\r\n  Moreover, for various reasons, infection experiments on animals\r\n  failed to supply proof, and finally a bacterium was discovered\r\n  (Shiga, 1898) to be the excitant of one form of dysentery.\r\n  Agglutination attested the specific part played by this organism,\r\n  as it was produced by the blood serum of a person suffering from\r\n  or recovered from dysentery, but not by the serum of one who was\r\n  uninfected. Bacillary dysentery consequently was a distinct entity.\r\n  The final step to be taken was to decide whether there was a specific\r\n  amœbic enteritis (amœbic dysentery or amœbiasis, according to\r\n  Musgrave).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Encysted intestinal amœbæ showing nuclear\r\nmultiplication. (After B. Grassi.)]\r\n\r\n  This question should decidedly be regarded from the positive point\r\n  of view. It is intimately connected with another, namely, whether\r\n  there are not several species of intestinal amœbæ. The possibility\r\n  of this had already been recognized. In addition to the _Amœba coli_\r\n  Lösch, R. Blanchard distinguished yet another, _Amœba intestinalis_,\r\n  and designated thereby the large amœbæ described in the first\r\n  communication made by Kartulis; later on he stated the distinction\r\n  between the species. Councilman and Lafleur[10] (1891) considered\r\n  the amœba of dysentery to be _Amœba coli_ Lösch and so re-named the\r\n  species _Amœba dysenteriæ_. Kruse and Pasquale (1893) employed the\r\n  same nomenclature, but retained the old name _Amœba coli_ Lösch for\r\n  the non-infectious species. Quincke and Roos (1893) set forth three\r\n  species: a smaller species (25 µ) finely granular, pathogenic for\r\n  men and cats (_Amœba coli_ Lösch); a larger species (40 µ) coarsely\r\n  granular, pathogenic for men but not for cats (_A. coli mitis_); and\r\n  a similar species non-pathogenic either for man or cat (_A. intestini\r\n  vulgaris_). Celli and Fiocca (1894–6) went still further, they\r\n  distinguished:\r\n\r\n  (1) _Amœba lobosa_ variety _guttula_ (= _A. guttula_ Duj), variety\r\n  _oblonga_ (= _A. oblonga_ Schm.) and variety _coli_ (= _A. coli_\r\n  Lösch).\r\n\r\n  (2) _Amœba spinosa_ n. sp. occurring in the vagina as well as in the\r\n  intestine of human patients suffering from diarrhœa and dysentery.\r\n\r\n  (3) _Amœba diaphana_ n. sp. found in the human intestine in cases of\r\n  dysentery.\r\n\r\n  (4) _Amœba vermicularis_ Weisse, present in the vagina and in\r\n  dysentery; and\r\n\r\n  (5) _Amœba reticularis_ n. sp. in dysentery.\r\n\r\n[10] “Amœbic Dysentery,” _Johns Hopkins Hosp. Repts._, ii, pp. 395–548,\r\n7 plates.\r\n\r\n  Shiga distinguished two species; a larger pathogenic species with\r\n  a somewhat active movement, and a small harmless species with a\r\n  somewhat sluggish movement. Bowman mentions two varieties, Strong\r\n  and Musgrave (1900) two species--the pathogenic _Amœba dysenteriæ_\r\n  and the non-pathogenic _Amœba coli_; Jäger (1902) and Jürgens (1902)\r\n  mention at least two species. In the following year (1903) a work\r\n  by Schaudinn was published which marked a real advance. This, in\r\n  conjunction with the establishing of a special genus (_Endamœba_ or\r\n  _Entamœba_) for human intestinal amœbæ first by Leidy[11] and then by\r\n  Casagrandi and Barbagallo,[12] for the time cleared up the confused\r\n  nomenclature, the old name _Amœba coli_ being retained for the\r\n  harmless intestinal amœbæ of man, whereas the pathogenic species was\r\n  designated _Entamœba histolytica_. The history of more recent work is\r\n  incorporated in the accounts of the entamœbæ given below.\r\n\r\n[11] “On _Amœba blattae_,” _Proc. Acad. Nat.

Schaudinn, 1903.\r\n\r\nSyn.: _Amœba coli_, Lösch, 1875. _Entamœba hominis_, Casagr. et Barbag.\r\n1897.\r\n\r\nThe amœboid trophozoite, according to Lösch, measures 26 µ to 30 µ and\r\nupwards; according to Grassi 8 µ to 22 µ; according to Schuberg 12 µ to\r\n26 µ. A separation of the body substance into ectoplasm and endoplasm\r\nis only perceived during movement. The pseudopodia, which are generally\r\nonly protruded singly, are broad and rounded at the end (lobopodia) and\r\nare hyaline, while the remainder of the body is granular. The ectoplasm\r\nis less refractile than the rest of the cytoplasm; it also stains less\r\nintensely (fig. 1), and is best seen on protrusion of a pseudopodium.\r\nRed blood corpuscles are rarely, if ever, found ingested in the\r\ncytoplasm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--_Entamœba coli_: life-cycle, _a_-_e_, stages\r\nin binary fission; _A_-_D_, schizogony, with formation of eight\r\nmerozoites; 2–10, cyst formation or sporogony, with formation of eight\r\nnucleate cysts. (After Castellani and Chalmers)]\r\n\r\nThe nucleus is vesicular, and is spherical when inactive, measuring\r\n5 µ to 7 µ, with a thick nuclear membrane. In the centre of the\r\nnucleus is a chromatinic body or karyosome or sometimes several small\r\nnuclear bodies formed of plastin and chromatin; the remaining chromatin\r\nis arranged on the achromatic network in the form of fine granules,\r\nespecially thickly deposited on the nuclear membrane.\r\n\r\n_Entamœba coli_ lives as a commensal in the upper portion of the\r\nlarge intestine, where the fæces still possess a pulpy consistency.\r\nWith their concentration and change in reaction lower in the bowel,\r\nthe parasites either die or else if they are at a suitable stage of\r\ndevelopment form resistant cysts. These cysts (fig. 2) can be found\r\nin great abundance in normal fæces, as Grassi first observed. Slight\r\nlaxantia or intestinal diseases of any kind producing increased\r\nperistalsis, however, show amœbæ even in the unencysted condition,\r\nprovided that the person harbours intestinal amœbæ generally. The\r\nintensity of infection varies according to the locality; thus Schaudinn\r\nfound that 50 per cent. of the persons examined were infected with\r\nharmless amœbæ in East Prussia, 20 per cent. in Berlin and about 66 per\r\ncent. on the Austrian littoral.\r\n\r\nThe life-history (fig. 3) of the parasite exhibits two phases: (_a_)\r\nasexual multiplication in the intestine, either by binary fission or\r\nby schizogony with formation of eight merozoites, and (_b_) sporogony\r\nleading to the production of eight-nucleate cysts. Infection results\r\nfrom ingestion of cysts. Only cysts with eight nuclei are infective.\r\nThe diameter of such cysts is about 15 µ to 20 µ.\r\n\r\n  There are varying accounts of the details of the life-cycle of\r\n  _Entamœba coli_ in its different stages. Thus, regarding schizogony\r\n  or multiple fission it was formerly stated that the nucleus of the\r\n  parent amœba divided into eight portions, which after dissolution\r\n  of the nuclear membrane, passed outwards into the cytoplasm, which\r\n  segregated around each. Eight merozoites were thus produced. More\r\n  recently the process of schizogony has been considered to consist\r\n  in the repeated division of the nucleus into two, four, and finally\r\n  eight nuclei (fig. 3, A-D), and the formation of eight merozoites or\r\n  amœbulæ.\r\n\r\n  The process of encystment is initiated by the extrusion of all liquid\r\n  and foreign bodies from the protoplasm, which assumes a spherical\r\n  form (fig. 4, A). The rounded uninucleate amœba then secretes a soft\r\n  gelatinous coat, which finally differentiates into a double contoured\r\n  cyst wall in older cysts. According to Casagrandi and Barbagallo,\r\n  the size of the cyst varies from 8 µ to 30 µ, and averages about\r\n  15 µ. According to Schaudinn (1903) the cytological changes during\r\n  cyst formation are as follows. The nucleus of a rounded uninucleate\r\n  form divides into two (fig. 4, B). Each of these nuclei fragments\r\n  into chromidia (fig. 4, C), some of which are absorbed, while\r\n  others reunite so that the cell becomes binucleate again. Each of\r\n  these nuclei, by a twice repeated division, produces three nuclei\r\n  (fig. 4, D), the smaller two of which degenerate and were regarded as\r\n  reduction nuclei. There is a clear zone or vacuole in the middle of\r\n  the cyst during these maturation processes, dividing the cyst into\r\n  two halves. After the nuclear reduction the clear space disappears,\r\n  and each nucleus (termed by some a gamete nucleus) divides into\r\n  two pronuclei (fig. 4, E). The pronuclei of the pairs were said by\r\n  Schaudinn to differ slightly. Copulation occurs between pairs of\r\n  unlike pronuclei, and is an example of autogamy (fig. 4, F). When\r\n  complete, each of the fusion nuclei (synkarya) divides twice, giving\r\n  rise first to four and finally to eight nuclei. Eight amœbulæ are\r\n  thus formed within the cyst.\r\n\r\n  According to Hartmann and Whitmore (1911)[13], however, autogamy\r\n  does not occur within the cysts of _E. coli._ They consider that\r\n  eight small amœbulæ are formed (fig. 3, _2_-_10_) which escape from\r\n  the cyst and then conjugate in pairs (fig. 3, _10_-_12_), afterwards\r\n  growing into a new generation of trophozoites.\r\n\r\n[13] _Archiv f. Protistenkunde_, xxiv, p. 182.\r\n\r\n  Only some 10 to 20 per cent. of the cysts evacuated with the\r\n  fæces undergo the full course of development, the majority perish\r\n  previously. In old dry fæces, only cysts with eight nuclei are found,\r\n  and it is these alone that cause the infection.\r\n\r\n  _Entamœba williamsi_, _E. bütschlii_, _E. hartmanni_ and _E. poleki_\r\n  (Prowazek) are probably only varieties of _E. coli_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--So-called autogamy of _Entamœba coli_. A,\r\nrounded amœba; B, nucleus dividing; C, the two daughter-nuclei giving\r\noff chromidia; D, each nucleus has formed two reduction nuclei; E,\r\ncyst membrane formed, and gamete nuclei are dividing; F, cyst with two\r\nsynkarya.]\r\n\r\nThe principal feature distinguishing _Entamœba coli_ from _E.\r\nhistolytica_ is the formation of eight-nucleate cysts by the former as\r\ncontrasted with the tetra-nucleate cysts of the latter. The cyst-wall\r\nof _E. coli_ is thicker than that of _E. histolytica_ (_tetragena_).\r\nFurther, _E. coli_ does not usually ingest red blood corpuscles, nor\r\nare “chromidial blocks” present inside its cyst (see p. 40).\r\n\r\nAccording to Chatton and Lalung-Bonnaire[14] (1912) the entamœbæ of\r\nvertebrates should be placed in a separate genus _Löschia_, as they\r\ndiffer in their life-history from _E. blattæ_, the type species of\r\n_Entamœba_. Leidy (1879), however, named the genus _Endamœba_, but\r\nfurther researches are necessary on biological variation among these\r\norganisms.\r\n\r\n[14] _Bull. Soc. Path. Exotique_, v, p. 135.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Entamœba histolytica*, Schaudinn, 1903.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Amœba coli_, autt. p. p. _Amœba dysenteriæ_, autt. p. p.\r\n\r\nThe average size of the amœboid trophozoite is 25 µ to 30 µ. In fæces\r\ndiluted with salt solution the amœbæ swell to 40 µ and more. There is\r\nsometimes separation of the body substance into a strongly refractile\r\nvitreous ectoplasm and a corneous endoplasm, pronounced even in\r\nrepose, although the former is not equally thick at all parts of the\r\nperiphery. In the endoplasm generally there are numerous foreign bodies\r\n(bacteria, epithelial cells, colourless and red blood corpuscles\r\n(fig. 6), and occasionally living flagellates of the intestine). The\r\nnucleus is 4 µ to 6 µ in diameter, and may be difficult to recognize\r\nbecause it is sometimes weakly refractile and poor in chromatin. Its\r\nshape is slightly variable; it is usually excentric, sometimes wholly\r\nperipheral at the limit of the two parts of the body. Vacuoles are not\r\npresent in quite fresh specimens, but appear later. In the study of\r\n_E. histolytica_, the morphological characters of the trophozoite or\r\nvegetative stage of the organism formerly separated as _E. tetragena_\r\n(figs. 5, 6, 8_a_) must be considered (see p. 38).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--_Entamœba histolytica_ (_tetragena_ form),\r\nshowing three successive changes of form due to movement. × 1100.\r\n(After Hartmann.)]\r\n\r\n  The history of the development of these species, which give rise\r\n  to amœbic enteritis as distinguished from bacillary dysentery,\r\n  was formerly not so well known as that of _E. coli_. Upon being\r\n  introduced into cats (_per anum_) dysenteric amœbæ provoke symptoms\r\n  similar to those in man. In the latter, besides metastatic liver\r\n  abscesses, abscesses of the lungs, and, according to Kartulis,\r\n  cerebral abscesses are occasionally produced. Marchoux (1899) states\r\n  that when the disease has lasted for some time liver abscesses are\r\n  produced in cats also.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 6.--_Entamœba histolytica_ which has ingested\r\n  many red blood corpuscles. × 1100. (After Hartmann.)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 7.--Section through wall of large intestine (of a\r\n  man) close under an ulcer caused by _Entamœba histolytica_. A, amœbæ\r\n  that have penetrated partly in blood-vessels (Bv), partly in tissue\r\n  of submucosa to the muscularis. Magnified. (After Harris.)]\r\n\r\n  In the large intestine of infected cats the amœbæ creep over the\r\n  epithelium, and here and there they force the epithelial cells\r\n  apart, as well as removing them or pushing them in front of them;\r\n  the amœbæ thus insert themselves into the narrowest fissures. They\r\n  penetrate also into the glands through the epithelium, and thence\r\n  into the connective tissue of the mucosa. Intestinal and glandular\r\n  epithelia perish under the influence of these parasites: the cells\r\n  are pushed aside, fall to pieces or are absorbed by the amœbæ. In the\r\n  connective tissue of the mucosa the amœbæ migrate further, and often\r\n  accumulate above the muscles. Finally they rupture this and force\r\n  their way into the submucosa. In cats, apparently, the penetration\r\n  is not so great as in men, according to Kruse and Pasquale. During\r\n  their migration the parasites also gain access to the lymph-follicles\r\n  of the wall of the intestine, which become swollen and commence\r\n  to suppurate; follicular abscesses arise and after their rupture\r\n  follicular ulcers. The diseased patches in the mucosa are markedly\r\n  hyperæmic and numerous hæmorrhages are set up. Roos and Harris state\r\n  that the amœbæ also penetrate into the blood-vessels (fig. 7) and\r\n  this explains the occurrence of metastatic abscesses.[15] The whole\r\n  submucosa is severely swollen at the diseased spot and undergoes\r\n  small-celled infiltration in the neighbourhood of the colonies of\r\n  amœbæ. From these findings Jürgens (1902) draws the conclusion[16]\r\n  which is followed here, that the amœbæ are causative agents of the\r\n  enteritis of cats, which disease is well defined, both pathologically\r\n  and anatomically. Subsequent researches confirm the experience of\r\n  earlier authors; great precautions were taken to exclude errors,\r\n  hence, as with Gross and Harris, no exception can be taken to their\r\n  results. The inoculation material was derived from soldiers who\r\n  suffered from amœbic enteritis in China and who were admitted into\r\n  the garrison hospital at Berlin. In order to be independent of the\r\n  patients themselves, transmission experiments from cat to cat were\r\n  performed, after the first experiments on cats yielded positive\r\n  results. This was also effected by rectal feeding as employed by\r\n  earlier workers. Such appeared necessary in order to prevent the\r\n  evacuation of the inoculation material _per anum_, as well as to\r\n  avoid the employment of morphia and ether narcosis. Forty-six cats\r\n  were used for the experiments. Ten cats received tested stools\r\n  containing motile amœbæ from soldiers suffering from amœbic enteritis\r\n  contracted in China. Sixteen other cats received stools from cats\r\n  infected by inoculation. All the animals sickened and suffered from\r\n  the disease. Five cats received dejecta from human amœbic enteritis\r\n  in which, however, no _motile_ amœbæ were present. Thirteen cats\r\n  received stools from soldiers who suffered from bacillary dysentery.\r\n  None of the latter cats took the complaint and none showed changes\r\n  in the large intestine upon sectioning. The injection of various\r\n  bacteria, obtained from a stool of amœbic enteritis pathogenic\r\n  to cats, remained without result in both the cats employed for\r\n  this experiment. Lastly, two cats, which had been kept with those\r\n  artificially infected, were taken ill spontaneously and suffered from\r\n  the disease. In the opinion of Harris, who ascertained the harmless\r\n  nature of bacteria derived from the intestinal flora containing\r\n  dysenteric amœbæ, young dogs are capable of being infected.\r\n\r\n[15] Lung abscesses generally arise by the bursting of a liver abscess\r\nthrough the diaphragm into the right lower lobe of the lung, sometimes\r\nalso through conveyance of amœbæ by means of the blood-stream (Banting).\r\n\r\n[16] These findings were confirmed by Schaudinn by means of\r\ninvestigations on cats and men. _Cf._ also Alfred Gross, Marchoux,\r\nP. G. Woolley, W. E. Musgrave, H. F. Harris and others.\r\n\r\n  Within the large intestine an active increase of _Entamœba\r\n  histolytica_ must occur. Nevertheless, Jürgens did not definitely\r\n  find changes that might be interpreted in this sense. Schaudinn\r\n  (1903) observed division and gemmation _in vivo_. Both processes, in\r\n  which the nucleus divides by amitosis, can only be distinguished by\r\n  the fact that the daughter individuals are similar in binary fission\r\n  but dissimilar in gemmation, whether they make their appearance\r\n  singly or in greater numbers. Schizogony, resulting in the formation\r\n  of eight individuals, which is so characteristic for _Entamœba coli_,\r\n  was not observed. (But schizogony, into four merozoites, is now known\r\n  to occur. Gemmation processes are apparently degenerative.)\r\n\r\n  Resistant stages, which serve for transmission to other hosts, are\r\n  according to Schaudinn[17] first formed when the diseased portions\r\n  commence to heal, or more accurately, the recovery commences when\r\n  the vegetative increase of the amœbæ in the intestine discontinues.\r\n  The so-called spores of _E. histolytica_ were distinguished very\r\n  definitely from those of _E. coli_; they were said to consist of\r\n  spheres of only 3 to 7 µ in diameter, which were surrounded by a\r\n  double membrane, at first colourless, but becoming a light brownish\r\n  yellow colour after a few hours, and possessing a protoplasmic\r\n  content containing chromidia. They were said to arise by fragments\r\n  of chromatin passing outwards from the nucleus of the amœba into\r\n  the surrounding cytoplasm (fig. 9, _a_) and undergoing so marked\r\n  an increase that finally the whole cytoplasm became filled with\r\n  chromidia. The remainder of the nucleus underwent degeneration and\r\n  became extruded. On the surface of the cytoplasm there then arose\r\n  small protuberances containing chromidia. These processes had\r\n  been observed in the living organisms. They gradually divided and\r\n  separated from membranes which later became yellow. The remainder of\r\n  the amœba perished. Craig[18] had also seen phases of this process\r\n  of development. It must be remarked that, according to recent\r\n  researches, these processes of exogenous sporulation are degenerative\r\n  in character (see p. 41). The small spores may be fungi. The\r\n  “sporulation” processes are only mentioned here as a warning. They\r\n  are now only of historic interest. By means of an experiment made on\r\n  a cat, Schaudinn ascertained that ingestion of permanent cysts, which\r\n  resist desiccation, is the cause of the infection. The animal took\r\n  food containing dry fæces with amœba cysts; these fæces came from a\r\n  patient suffering from amœbic enteritis in China. On the evening\r\n  of the third day the cat evacuated blood-stained mucous fæces which\r\n  contained large numbers of typical _Entamœba histolytica_. On the\r\n  fourth day after the infection the animal experimented upon died, and\r\n  the large intestine showed the changes previously stated.\r\n\r\n[17] _Arb. a. d. kaiserl. Gesundheitsamte_, xix, pp, 547–576.\r\n\r\n[18] “Life cycle of _Amœba coli_ in Human Body,” _American Medicine_,\r\n1904, vii, p. 299; viii, p. 185.\r\n\r\n  _E. histolytica_ also is found in the large intestine. This was\r\n  originally shown to be the case by Kartulis, and the fact has\r\n  recently been confirmed from many quarters. It is also present in\r\n  the metastatic abscesses of which it is the cause (_cf._ among other\r\n  authors, Rogers, _Brit. Med. Journ._, 1902, ii, No. 2,177, p. 844;\r\n  and 1903, i, No. 2,214, p. 1315).\r\n\r\n  It should lastly be pointed out in this connection that mixed\r\n  infections also take place. For instance, in addition to _E.\r\n  histolytica_, _E. coli_, and, under certain circumstances,\r\n  flagellates may be found together. In the same way _E. coli_ may\r\n  come under observation even in bacillary dysentery. On the other\r\n  hand, Schaudinn stated that in cases of dysentery endemic in Istria,\r\n  _Entamœba coli_, if it had hitherto been present, disappeared, to\r\n  return again after recovery from the illness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--_Entamœba histolytica_. _a_, trophozoite\r\n(_tetragena_ type) containing red blood corpuscles, × 1,300; _b_ and\r\n_c_, two isolated nuclei showing different appearances of karyosome,\r\ncentriole and nuclear membrane, × 2,600. (After Hartmann.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_Entamœba tetragena_, Viereck, 1907.)\r\n\r\nThis amœba must now be considered to be a part of the lifecycle of\r\n_Entamœba histolytica_, in fact a very important part of that cycle,\r\nespecially in its tetranucleate cystic stages.\r\n\r\nThis organism, the so-called _Entamœba tetragena_, may occur in the\r\nhuman intestine in cases of amœbic dysentery, especially in mild\r\nor chronic cases. It was discovered by Viereck in 1907 in patients\r\nsuffering from dysentery contracted in Africa. Soon afterwards an\r\nindependent description was published by Hartmann, who called the amœba\r\n_E. africana_. It was also studied by Bensen and Werner. Recently\r\n(1912–13) much work has been published on this amœba by Darling and\r\nothers; in this way its relationship to Schaudinn’s _E. histolytica_\r\nhas been made known.\r\n\r\nIn general morphology it somewhat resembles _Entamœba coli_, and its\r\ndiscoverer at first mistook it for a variety of that species. According\r\nto Hartmann, a distinct ectoplasm is only clearly visible when a\r\npseudopodium is protruded (fig. 5). The granular endoplasm may contain\r\ningested red blood corpuscles (fig. 6). The large, round nucleus is\r\nvisible in the fresh state (fig. 8, _a_). So-called chromidial masses\r\n(? crystalloidal substances) may occur in the cytoplasm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--_Entamœba histolytica_ (_tetragena_ form).\r\n_a_, emission of chromatin from nucleus; _b_, nuclear division; _c_,\r\ndegenerating form with two nuclei; _d_, _e_, _f_, cysts containing\r\none, two and four nuclei respectively, and showing chromidial blocks.\r\n× 2,000. (After Hartmann.)]\r\n\r\nSome investigators, as Hartmann,[19] lay stress on the internal\r\nstructure of the nucleus (fig. 8, _b_, _c_), best seen in preparations\r\nfixed wet and stained with iron-hæmatoxylin. The nucleus is limited\r\nby a well-marked nuclear membrane, on the inside of which granules\r\nor nodules of chromatin may occur. There is a karyosome, which, in\r\nsuccessfully stained specimens, shows, at times, a central dot called\r\na centriole. (The nucleus of _Entamœba coli_ does not contain such a\r\ncentriole.) However, the structure of the nucleus varies at different\r\nperiods during the life-cycle.\r\n\r\n[19] _Arch. f. Protistenkunde_ (1911), xxiv, p. 163.\r\n\r\nThe diameter of the trophozoites or vegetative forms (fig. 8, _a_) is\r\nvariously given as from 20 µ to 40 µ. Multiplication proceeds by binary\r\nfission and also by schizogony into four merozoites.[20]\r\n\r\n[20] _See_ Darling, 1913, _Arch. Intern. Med._, vol. ii, pl. i, fig. 3.\r\n\r\nReproduction takes place by endogenous encystment (fig. 9, _d_-_f_),\r\nwhich is preceded by nuclear division into two, reduction and then\r\nautogamy. The interpretation of the latter phenomenon as autogamy is\r\ndisputed by some authors. The round cysts, which may measure 12 µ to\r\n15 µ in diameter, contain four nuclei, together with darkly staining\r\nmasses of various shapes, the so-called “chromidial blocks” (fig. 9,\r\n_f_). The cyst-wall of _E. histolytica_ (_tetragena_) is thinner than\r\nthat of _E. coli_, and the diameter of the cyst is rather less. _E.\r\nhistolytica_ has not yet been cultivated.\r\n\r\nInfection in man occurs by way of the mouth by the ingestion of\r\ncysts. A patient showing acute symptoms of dysentery is not usually\r\ninfective, for he is merely harbouring the large trophozoites, which,\r\nby experiment, have been shown not to be infective to animals (kittens)\r\nwhen administered by the mouth. The stools of recovered patients\r\nmay still contain cysts, and they may thus act as cyst-carriers or\r\nreservoirs of disease by infecting water and soil. The stools of\r\nsuch cyst-carriers are often solid, and so cysts of _E. histolytica_\r\n(_tetragena_) are easily overlooked. Mathis (1913)[21] points out that\r\nhealthy carriers of _E. histolytica_ may be found; 8 per cent. of the\r\nnatives of Tonkin examined by him were healthy carriers of cysts.\r\n\r\n[21] _Bull. Soc. Med. et Chirurg. Indo-Chine_, iv, p. 474.\r\n\r\nIn return cases, or prolonged untreated cases of entamœbic dysentery, a\r\ngeneration of smaller trophozoites is associated with, or replaces the\r\nlarger ones. In stools they are frequently refractile and consequently\r\nstain slowly _intra vitam_. These trophozoites are the “smaller,\r\nsenile, or pre-cyst generation” of Darling. This pre-cyst generation is\r\ncharacterized by the presence of blocks of crystalloidal substance in\r\nthe cytoplasm, and by the possession of a prominent, densely stainable\r\nkaryosome. Darling believes this generation to be the same as that\r\ndescribed by Elmassian as _Entamœba minuta_.[22]\r\n\r\n[22] _Centralbl. f. Bakter._, Orig., lii, p. 335.\r\n\r\nWalker,[23] Darling,[24] Wenyon[25] and others believe that _Entamœba\r\nhistolytica_, which was only seen by Schaudinn in a single case, that\r\nof a Chinaman, is really _E. tetragena_. Darling states that if the\r\npublished illustrations of _E. histolytica_ and of _E. tetragena_ are\r\ncollected from the literature and compared, it will be seen that the\r\nwriters have been calling _E. histolytica_ the large trophozoites seen\r\nin dysenteric stools. These large trophozoites frequently display no\r\nkaryosome, but they can be demonstrated as _E. tetragena_ by animal\r\ninoculation, or by the history of the case. On the other hand, the\r\nillustrations of _E. tetragena_ show that the authors have been\r\ndealing with the small generation or reduced forms (“_E. minuta_”),\r\nwhich are the direct descendants of the large trophozoites. If kittens\r\nare inoculated rectally with dysenteric material containing large\r\ntrophozoites, the strain may be carried in successive kittens for\r\nfour to six transfers. If, on the other hand, kittens are inoculated\r\nrectally with small trophozoites of the pre-cyst generation, the\r\ntransmission cannot be carried through more than one or two kittens.\r\nWenyon has succeeded in maintaining _E. tetragena_ in kittens for\r\nseveral generations.\r\n\r\n[23] _Philip. Journ. Sc._ (1911), B, vi, p. 259.\r\n\r\n[24] _Annals Trop. Med. and Parasitol._ (1913), vii, p. 321.\r\n\r\n[25] _Brit. Med. Journ._, Nov. 15, 1913, p. 1287, and _Journ. Lond.\r\nSchool Trop. Med._, ii, p. 27.\r\n\r\nIn some of the preparations from the last remove, pathological forms\r\nof the trophozoites may be seen. These show abnormal forms of budding,\r\nespecially peripherally, such as have been described by Schaudinn and\r\nby Craig as characteristic of _E. histolytica_. Schaudinn’s small\r\nperipheral, exogenous buds and cysts are thus explained. Craig has\r\nlatterly changed his views.\r\n\r\nFurther, Darling states that _tetragena_ cysts fed by the mouth\r\nto kittens produce bowel lesions in which trophozoites having the\r\ncharacters of _E. tetragena_, _E. histolytica_ and _E. nipponica_\r\n(Koidzumi) occur.\r\n\r\nIn view of the work of recent observers, the peculiar exogenous\r\nencystment which Schaudinn made characteristic of _Entamœba\r\nhistolytica_ has been shown to be due to degenerative changes in senile\r\nraces of the amœba. _E. histolytica_ and _E. tetragena_ are one and the\r\nsame species, and its trophozoite is subject to variation. According\r\nto some observers the _histolytica_ type of nucleus--described by\r\nSchaudinn as being poor in chromatin and not easily seen in the\r\nfresh state--occurs frequently in patients with severe symptoms of\r\ndysentery; on the other hand, the _tetragena_ type of nucleus--round\r\nand easily seen in the fresh state--may occur in cases presenting\r\nslight dysenteric symptoms. Intermediate types of nuclei are seen. The\r\nname of this species, the principal pathogenic amœba of man, must then\r\nbe _E. histolytica_ by priority. The cystic stages of _E. histolytica_\r\nare those first recorded by Viereck and formerly described as _E.\r\ntetragena_. The geographical distribution of _E. histolytica_ is wide.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Noc’s Entamœba* (1909).\r\n\r\nA species of Entamœba was cultivated by Noc[26] in 1909 from cysts\r\nderived from liver abscesses, from dysenteric stools and from the\r\nwater supply of Saigon, Cochin China. He cultivated it in association\r\nwith bacteria. It is pathogenic. It has been considered allied to\r\n_E. histolytica_, and shows internal segmentation or schizogony. It\r\nexhibits polymorphism. This amœba has been found by Greig and Wells\r\n(1911) in cases of dysentery in India. It is an important organism and\r\nrequires further investigation.\r\n\r\n[26] Noc, F. (1909), _Ann. Inst. Pasteur_, xxiii, p. 177.\r\n\r\nCertain other Entamœbæ[27] have been described at various times from\r\nthe intestinal tract of man. Probably most, if not all, of these are\r\nnot good species and in some cases much more information is needed.\r\n\r\n[27] See Fantham, H. B. (1911), _Annals Trop. Med. and Parasitol._, v,\r\np. 111.\r\n\r\n_Entamœba tropicalis_ (Lesage, 1908). This parasite is said to be\r\nnon-pathogenic, and to occur in the intestine of man in the tropics. It\r\nhas a general resemblance to _E. coli_, but forms small cysts (6 µ to\r\n10 µ in diameter). The nucleus of the cyst is said to break up into a\r\nvariable number of daughter nuclei, from three to thirteen having been\r\nnoted. Lesage states that it is culturable in symbiosis with bacteria.\r\nIt is probably a variety of _E. coli_, if not a cultural amœba.\r\n\r\n_Entamœba hominis_ (Walker, 1908) has a diameter of 6 µ to 15 µ. A\r\ncontractile vacuole is present. Encystment is total, and small cysts\r\nare formed. It is culturable. The original strain, now lost, was\r\nobtained from an autopsy in Boston Hospital. This organism is probably\r\na cultural amœba.\r\n\r\n_Entamœba phagocytoides_ (Gauducheau, 1908). This parasite was\r\ndiscovered in a case of dysentery at Hanoi, Indo-China. The amœba is\r\nsmall, 2 µ to 15 µ in diameter. It is active. It ingests bacteria and\r\nred blood corpuscles, while peculiar spirilla-like bodies are found in\r\nits cytoplasm. It multiplies by binary and multiple fission. It can be\r\ncultivated. More recently (1912) the author appears to consider the\r\namœba to be a stage of a _Trichomonas_, but abandons the view later\r\n(1914). Further researches on this organism are needed.\r\n\r\n_Entamœba minuta_ (Elmassian, 1909)[28] was found, in association with\r\n_E. coli_, in a case of chronic dysentery in Paraguay. It resembles\r\n_E. tetragena_ but is smaller, rarely exceeding 14 µ in diameter.\r\nSchizogony occurs, four merozoites being produced. The encystment is\r\ntotal and endogenous, giving rise to cysts containing four nuclei.\r\nThis amœba is considered by Darling and others to be the pre-cyst\r\ntrophozoite stage of _E. histolytica_ (_tetragena_).\r\n\r\n[28] _Centralbl. f. Bakter._, Orig., lii, p. 335.\r\n\r\n_Entamœba nipponica_ (Koidzumi, 1909) was found in the motions of\r\nJapanese suffering from dysentery or from diarrhœa, in the former case\r\nin company with _Entamœba histolytica_. Its diameter is 15 µ to 30 µ.\r\nThe endoplasm is phagocytic for red blood corpuscles. The nucleus is\r\nwell defined, resembling that of _E. coli_ and of _E. tetragena_.\r\nMultiplication occurs by binary fission and by schizogony. Encystment\r\nis total, but has not been completely followed. Darling and others\r\nconsider that this is an abnormal form of _E. histolytica_, while\r\nAkashi (1913) doubts if it is an amœba at all, but rather is to be\r\nregarded as shed epithelial cells.\r\n\r\nGENERAL REMARK.--It is now considered by some workers that true\r\nEntamœbæ cannot be cultivated on artificial media. Quite recently\r\nWilliams and Calkins (1913)[29] have somewhat doubted this opinion, and\r\nstate that certain cultural amœbæ, originally obtained from Musgrave in\r\nManila, exhibit the various morphological variations associated with\r\ntrue entamœbæ of the human digestive tract.\r\n\r\n[29] _Journ. of Med. Research_, xxix, p. 43.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Entamœba buccalis*, Prowazek, 1904.\r\n\r\nThe size varies from 6 µ to 32 µ. Ectoplasm is always present; the\r\nendoplasm contains numerous food-vacuoles. The nucleus is vesicular,\r\nwith a greenish tinted membrane which is poor in chromatin. The size\r\nof the nucleus is from 1·5 µ to 4·5 µ. A contractile vacuole is not\r\nvisible. The pseudopodium is broad. It was discovered in the mouths of\r\npersons with dental caries at Rovigno and also at Trieste, being most\r\neasily found in dense masses of leucocytes, also among leptothrix and\r\nspirochæte clusters. It can be easily distinguished from leucocytes\r\nby more intense staining with neutral red. Multiplication proceeds by\r\nfission. Transmission may take place through the small spherical cysts.\r\nThis species (fig. 10) has since been observed in Berlin, and is also\r\noccasionally found in carcinoma of various regions of the oral cavity.\r\n(Leyden and Löwenthal, 1905).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--_Entamœba buccalis_, Prow. _a_-_d_, the same\r\nspecimen observed during five minutes. × 1,000. _e_, amœba fixed and\r\nstained with iron-hæmatoxylin. × 1,500. (After Leyden and Löwenthal.)]\r\n\r\n_Entamœba buccalis_, Prow., is said to be allied to a protozoön which\r\nA. Tietze has found either encysted or free in the lumen of the\r\norifice of the parotid gland of an infant aged 4 months. The gland had\r\nundergone pathological change, and had therefore been extirpated. The\r\norganisms, which were roundish and three to four times the size of\r\nthe normal epithelial cells of the gland, were without a membrane and\r\npossessed a nucleus in which the chromatic substance appeared to be\r\ncontained in a karyosome. Bass and John’s[30] (Feb. 1915) and Smith,\r\nMiddleton and Barrett (1914) state that _E. buccalis_ is the cause of\r\npyorrhœa alveolaris.\r\n\r\n[30] _Journ. Amer. Med. Assoc._, lxiv, p. 553.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Entamœba undulans_, Aldo Castellani, 1905.\r\n\r\n  Under this name a protozoön is described which A. Castellani found in\r\n  addition to _Entamœba histolytica_ and _Trichomonas intestinalis_ in\r\n  the fæces of an European planter living in Ceylon, who had suffered\r\n  from amœbic enteritis and liver abscess. The shape of the body was\r\n  roundish or oval, 25 µ to 30 µ in the greatest diameter. It was\r\n  without a flagellum, but with an undulating membrane, and capable\r\n  of protruding a long pseudopodium from different parts of its body\r\n  at short intervals. The nucleus could not always be recognized in\r\n  life; it was, however, always demonstrable by staining. One or\r\n  two contractile vacuoles were present. The protoplasm was finely\r\n  granular, showing no differentiation into ecto- and endo-plasm.\r\n  According to Braun, in spite of the author declaring himself\r\n  expressly against the flagellate nature of the parasite, such\r\n  a nature may be assumed to be tolerably certain in view of the\r\n  description and illustration.\r\n\r\n  It is now considered that _Entamœba undulans_ is a portion of a\r\n  flagellate, namely, _Trichomonas_.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Entamœba kartulisi*, Doflein, 1901.\r\n\r\nDoflein gave this name to amœbæ, from 30 µ to 38 µ in diameter, which\r\nKartulis (1893) found on examining the pus of an abscess in the right\r\nlower jaw of an Arab, aged 43, and in a portion of bone that had been\r\nextracted. The movements of the amœbæ (fig. 11) were more active\r\nthan those of “dysenteric amœbæ.” Their coarsely granular cytoplasm\r\ncontained blood and pus corpuscles, and a nucleus was generally only\r\nrecognizable after staining. Vacuoles were not seen with certainty.\r\nFlexner reported upon a similar case, and Kartulis published five\r\nadditional cases. As in these cases dental caries was present the\r\ninfection is likely to have proceeded from the oral cavity as a result\r\nof the carious teeth. Craig[31] (1911) considers that this parasite is\r\nprobably identical with _Entamœba histolytica_.\r\n\r\n[31] “The Parasitic Amœbæ of Man,” Lippincott, Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--_Entamœba kartulisi_, Dofl., from the pus of\r\nan abscess in the lower jaw, showing different stages of movement.\r\n(After Kartulis.)]\r\n\r\nIn the literature the following species have been reported as occurring\r\nin the oral cavity of man:--\r\n\r\n_Amœba gingivalis_, Gros, 1849. [? identical with _Entamœba buccalis_.]\r\n_Amœba buccalis_, Sternberg, 1862. _Amœba dentalis_, Grassi, 1879.\r\n\r\n  Far too little, however, is known concerning these to regard them\r\n  as definite species, that is, independent organisms; Grassi thinks\r\n  it even possible there may have been a confusion in their case with\r\n  salivary corpuscles. If they really are amœbæ they are all of them\r\n  probably identical with _Entamœba buccalis_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Genus *Paramœba*, Schaudinn, 1896.\r\n\r\n  Schaudinn established the genus _Paramœba_ for a marine rhizopod\r\n  which multiplied by division, became encysted at the end of its\r\n  vegetative life and then segmented into swarm bodies with two\r\n  flagella. These multiplied by longitudinal fission, and finally\r\n  passed into the condition of Amœbæ. Whether the human parasite\r\n  described by C. F. Craig (1906) as *Paramœba hominis.* belonged to\r\n  this genus was for a time uncertain. It is now placed in a new genus\r\n  Craigia, Calkins, 1912, since it possesses only one flagellum.[32]\r\n\r\n[32] See Craig (1913), _Amer. Journ. Trop. Dis. and Prevent. Med._, i,\r\np. 351.\r\n\r\n  In the amœbic stage it is 15 µ to 25 µ in diameter; ecto- and\r\n  endo-plasm during rest are indistinguishable. The body substance\r\n  is granular, with a spherical, sharply contoured nucleus and an\r\n  accessory nuclear body. No vacuoles are present, but occasionally the\r\n  endoplasm contains red blood corpuscles. The pseudopodia are hyaline,\r\n  finger- or lobe-shaped, and are protruded either singly or in twos.\r\n  Multiplication is by binary fission and by the formation of spherical\r\n  cysts (15 µ to 20 µ in diameter) in which occurs successive division\r\n  of the nuclei, ultimately forming ten to twelve roundish bodies\r\n  each of which soon develops a flagellum. The flagellate stages have\r\n  similarly a spherical shape and attain a diameter of 10 µ to 15 µ.\r\n  They also occasionally contain red blood corpuscles and pass either\r\n  directly or after longitudinal division into the amœboid phase.\r\n\r\n  Craig found these Amœbæ and the flagellate stage belonging to them in\r\n  six patients in the military hospital at Manila (Philippine Islands),\r\n  five of whom were suffering from simple diarrhœa whilst the sixth\r\n  exhibited an amœbic enteritis and contained also _Paramœba hominis_,\r\n  with _Entamœba histolytica_, Schaudinn. In one of the other cases,\r\n  _Trichomonas intestinalis_ was present.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. *Amœbæ from other Organs.*\r\n\r\n*Entamœba pulmonalis*, Artault, 1898.\r\n\r\nArtault[33] discovered a few amœboid forms with nucleus and vacuole\r\nin the contents of a lung cavity. In the fresh condition they were\r\ndistinguishable from leucocytes by their remarkable capacity of light\r\nrefraction. They were also much slower than the latter in staining\r\nwith methylene blue or fuchsine. Their movements became more lively\r\nin a strong light. Water and other reagents killed them, and then,\r\neven when stained, they could not be distinguished from leucocytes.\r\nThey have also been seen by Brumpt. R. Blanchard found amœbæ which may\r\nbelong here in the lungs of sheep. _A. pulmonalis_ is perhaps the same\r\nas _Entamœba buccalis_. Smith and Weidman[34] (1910, 1914) described\r\nan entamœba, _E. mortinatalium_, from the lungs and other organs of\r\ninfants in America.\r\n\r\n[33] _Arch. de Parasitologie_, i, p. 275.\r\n\r\n[34] _Amer. Journ. Trop. Dis. and Prevent. Med._, ii, p. 256.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Amœba urogenitalis*, Baelz, 1883.\r\n\r\nThis species was found in masses in the sanguineous urine as well\r\nas in the vagina of a patient in Japan, aged 23. Shortly before the\r\ndeath of the patient, which was caused by pulmonary tuberculosis,\r\nhæmaturia with severe tenesmus of the bladder had set in. The amœba,\r\nwhich showed great motility, and had a diameter of about 50 µ when\r\nquiescent, exhibited a granular cytoplasm and a vesicular nucleus.\r\nBaelz is of opinion that these parasites were introduced into the vulva\r\nwith the water used for washing the parts, and thence had penetrated\r\ninto the bladder and vagina. Doflein places the organism in the genus\r\n_Entamœba_, and it is perhaps identical with _E. histolytica_.\r\n\r\n  Similar cases are also reported (1892–3) by other authors: Jürgens,\r\n  Kartulis, Posner, and Wijnhoff. Jürgens found small mucous cysts,\r\n  filled with amœboid bodies, in the bladder of an old woman suffering\r\n  from chronic cystitis; they were also found in the vagina. The\r\n  amœba observed by Kartulis in the sanguineous urine of a woman,\r\n  aged 58, suffering from a tumour of the bladder, measured 12 µ to\r\n  20 µ, and exhibited slow movements by protruding short pseudopodia.\r\n  The vacuoles and nucleus became visible only after staining with\r\n  methylene blue.\r\n\r\n  Posner’s case related to a man, aged 37, who had hitherto been quite\r\n  healthy and had never been out of Berlin. Suddenly, after a rigor,\r\n  he passed urine tinged with blood. This contained, besides red and\r\n  white blood corpuscles and hyaline and granular casts, large granular\r\n  bodies (about 50 µ in length and 28 µ in breadth), which slowly\r\n  altered their shape, and contained red blood corpuscles in addition\r\n  to other foreign matter. These bodies exhibited one or several nuclei\r\n  and some vacuoles. From the course of the disease, which extended\r\n  over a year, and during which similar attacks recurred, Posner came\r\n  to the conclusion that the amœbæ which had originally invaded the\r\n  bladder had penetrated into the pelvis of the kidney, where they\r\n  probably had settled in a cyst, and thence induced the repeated\r\n  attacks.\r\n\r\n  Wijnhoff observed four cases of amœburia in Utrecht.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Amœba miurai*, Ijima, 1898.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--_Amœba miurai_, Ij. × 500. _a_, fresh; _b_,\r\nafter treatment with dilute acetic acid. (After Ijima.)]\r\n\r\n  Under this term the author describes protoplasmic bodies which Miura,\r\n  in Tokyo, found in the serous fluid of a woman, aged 26, who had died\r\n  from pleuritis and peritonitis endotheliomatosa. Two days before\r\n  death these same forms had also appeared in the hæmorrhagic fæces\r\n  of the patient. The bodies were usually spherical or ellipsoidal,\r\n  and at one pole carried a small protuberance (fig. 12) beset with\r\n  filamentous short “pseudopodia” (really a pseudopodium covered with\r\n  cilia). Their size varied between 15 µ and 38 µ. The cytoplasm was\r\n  finely granular, and no difference was observable in the ecto- and\r\n  endo-plasm, only the villous appendage was clearer. The cytoplasm\r\n  contained vacuoles more or less numerous, none of which was\r\n  contractile. After the addition of acetic acid one to three nuclei\r\n  could be distinguished, 8 µ to 15 µ in size. Actual movements were\r\n  not observed. Taking everything into consideration, the independent\r\n  nature of these bodies is, to say the least, doubtful, although it\r\n  cannot be denied that they possess a certain similarity to the marine\r\n  _Amœba fluida_, Grüber or Greeff, and to a few other species. (It\r\n  is likely that cells present in serous exudation were mistaken for\r\n  amœbæ.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n“_Rhizopods in Poliomyelitis acuta._”\r\n\r\n  In three cases of poliomyelitis acuta which were investigated\r\n  by Ellermann, the spinal fluid obtained by puncture of the cord\r\n  contained bodies, from 10 µ to 15 µ in size, which had amœboid\r\n  movements and exhibited variously shaped pseudopodia in large\r\n  numbers. After staining, a usually excentric nucleus, about 1·5 µ in\r\n  size, was demonstrated in them.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder. *Foraminifera*, d’Orbigny.\r\n\r\n  The order is divided by Max Schultze into Monothalamia and\r\n  Polythalamia. Only a few of the former can be considered here.\r\n\r\n\r\nSub-Order. *Monothalamia.* (Testaceous Amœbæ).\r\n\r\nThese forms occur frequently in fresh water, rarely in sea water.\r\nThey possess a shell which is either pseudo-chitinous in character,\r\nor consists of foreign particles, or in a few cases is composed of\r\nsiliceous lamellæ. There is usually an orifice for the protrusion of\r\npseudopodia. The only representative of the order of interest here is:--\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Chlamydophrys*, Cienkowski, 1876.\r\n\r\n  The genus is based on a form which A. Schneider carefully\r\n  investigated and considered to be the _Difflugia enchelys_ of\r\n  Ehrenberg. L. Cienkowski rediscovered this same form and created\r\n  for it the genus _Chlamydophrys_. We agree with this view, but not\r\n  with the renaming of the organism (so common at the time). If the\r\n  parasite in dung, _Chlamydophrys stercorea_ Cienk. is identical with\r\n  _Difflugia enchelys_ of Ehrenberg, the old specific name should be\r\n  retained.\r\n\r\nThe genus is characterized by the possession of a hyaline,\r\nstructureless, slightly flexible shell which is ovoid or reniform.\r\nAt the more pointed pole there is an orifice situated terminally\r\nor somewhat laterally, serving for the emergence of the filiform\r\npseudopodia (fig. 13, _a_). The protoplasm does not entirely fill the\r\ninterior of the shell. An equatorial zone bearing excretory granules\r\ndivides the shell internally into two almost equal portions. The\r\nanterior portion is rich in vacuoles and serves for the reception\r\nof nutriment and for digestion. The posterior part is vitreous, and\r\ncontains the nucleus. One to three contractile vacuoles are situated in\r\nthe equatorial zone.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Chlamydophrys enchelys*, Ehrbg.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Chlamydophrys stercorea_, L. Cienkowski.\r\n\r\nThis species (fig. 13) is found in the fæces of various animals\r\n(cattle, rabbits, mice, and lizards), and also in quite fresh human\r\nfæces. According to Schaudinn, the parasite occurs so frequently in\r\nthe human fæces that it must be considered of wide distribution. The\r\nspecies must traverse the intestine of man and animals during one stage\r\nof its life cycle, as Schaudinn showed by experiments on himself and\r\non mice. He infected himself with cysts (fig. 14) by swallowing them,\r\nand evacuated the first _Chlamydophrys_ as early as the following day.\r\nAfter the evacuation of numerous specimens on one of the following days\r\nthe infection ceased.\r\n\r\nThe nucleus of a living specimen is surrounded by a hyaline, strongly\r\nrefractile chromidial mass, arranged in the form of a ring. Chromatin\r\nstains colour it darkly.\r\n\r\n_Asexual multiplication_ (fig. 13, _b_), which takes place in fæces,\r\nfollows a similar course to that of allied forms (_e.g._, _Euglypha_,\r\n_Centropyxis_). It commences by the cytoplasm issuing from the\r\norifice of the shell and assuming the shape characteristic of the\r\nmother organism, but in a reverse position. The nucleus then divides\r\nby mitosis, when the daughter nuclei move apart from one another.\r\nThe chromidial ring also divides into two portions by a process of\r\ndumb-bell like constriction. The one daughter nucleus remains in the\r\nmother organism, the other moves towards the daughter individual, which\r\nthen separates from the parent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--_Chlamydophrys enchelys._ _a_, free, motile\r\nform, showing nucleus, equatorial granules, vacuoles and pseudopodia;\r\n_b_, dividing organism. × 760. (After Cienkowski.)]\r\n\r\n  In this species plasmogamic union of two or more individuals (up\r\n  to twenty) is frequently observed. Such colonies may similarly\r\n  divide, and in this way monstrosities frequently arise. When drying\r\n  of the fæces, or deficiency of food occurs, encystment takes place\r\n  apparently spontaneously. The whole body, as stated by Cienkowski,\r\n  issues from the shell, assumes a spherical shape (probably with\r\n  discharge of water) and becomes surrounded with a thick membrane\r\n  (fig. 14). After the addition of water and the escape of the encysted\r\n  _Chlamydophrys_, a new shell must be formed. Schaudinn, who has not\r\n  given a more detailed description of the process of encystment in\r\n  this species, but refers to Cienkowski and to similar observations\r\n  made on _Centropyxis_, states of the latter that the encystment takes\r\n  place within the shell.\r\n\r\nThe _sexual multiplication_ is accompanied by shedding of all the\r\nforeign bodies and of the degenerating nucleus. The protoplasm, now\r\ncontracting into a sphere, remains behind in the shell with the\r\nchromidial mass. From the latter several new nuclei arise (sexual\r\nnuclei) often eight in number. The cytoplasmic sphere then segregates\r\ninto as many spherical portions as there are nuclei present. When\r\nthey have assumed an oval form, two flagella develop at one pole\r\nand the flagellispores swarm out of the shell.[35] The biflagellate\r\nswarm-spores, or gametes, copulate in pairs and apparently the\r\nindividuals of the pairs of gametes arise from different mother\r\norganisms. The zygote secretes a thick covering which soon becomes\r\nbrown and rough. These zygote cysts or resistant spores must now pass\r\nfrom the intestine of an animal in order to complete their development.\r\nThe escape of the cyst contents does not always take place in the\r\nintestine; often it does not occur until after defæcation. These\r\nshell-less individuals (amœbulæ) soon become invested with a shell. But\r\nin the alkaline intestinal contents, shell formation may proceed even\r\nwhile the organism is in the intestine, and multiplication may take\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n[35] Schaudinn (1903), _Arb. a. d. Kaiserl. Gesundh._, xix, p. 547.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--_Chlamydophrys enchelys_, encysted; on the\r\nleft the old capsule. × 760. (After Cienkowski.)]\r\n\r\nSchaudinn’s further communication was of special interest; it was to\r\nthe effect that _Chlamydophrys_ was related to\r\n\r\n\r\n*Leydenia gemmipara*, Schaudinn, 1896.\r\n\r\nIn the fluid removed by puncture from two patients suffering from\r\nascites in the first medical clinic in Berlin, cellular bodies with\r\nspontaneous movement were found, which Leyden and Schaudinn regard as\r\ndistinct organisms. They remained alive without the use of the warm\r\nstage for four or five hours, the external temperature being 24° to\r\n25° C. In a quiescent condition they were of a spherical or irregular\r\npolygonal form. Their surface was rarely smooth, being beset with\r\nprotuberances and excrescences (fig. 15). The substance of the body\r\nwas thickly permeated with light refractile granules with a yellowish\r\nshimmer. The hyaline ectoplasm was rarely seen distinctly. All sizes\r\nfrom 3 µ to 36 µ in diameter were observed. The movements were rather\r\nsluggish, the ectoplasm in the meantime appearing in the form of one\r\nor several lamellæ, in which also strings of the granular endoplasm\r\noccurred, and frequently protruded over the border of the hyaline\r\npseudopodia. The tendency for the joining of several individuals by\r\nmeans of their pseudopodia was so marked that associations ensued\r\nsimilar to those known in free-living Rhizopoda.\r\n\r\nThe cytoplasm enclosed blood corpuscles as well as numerous vacuoles,\r\none of which pulsated slowly about every quarter of an hour. A\r\nvesicular nucleus the diameter of which was about equal to one-fifth of\r\nthe body was present.\r\n\r\nMultiplication took place by means of division and budding (fig. 15,\r\n_c_), after previous direct division of the nucleus. The buds were\r\nsupposed to divide repeatedly soon after their appearance, thus giving\r\nrise to minute forms of 3 µ.\r\n\r\nThere was a suspicion in both cases that the ascites was associated\r\nwith malignant neoplasms in the abdomen, and autopsy confirmed this\r\nview in one case.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--_Leydenia gemmipara_, Schaud. _a_, in a\r\nquiescent condition, × 1000; _b_, in the act of moving, × 1000; _c_,\r\nfrom a fixed preparation, showing a bud, × 1500.]\r\n\r\nThe parasite, which has seldom been observed, has been variously\r\ninterpreted; for example, it has been regarded merely as altered tissue\r\ncells. It is now known, from Schaudinn’s researches, that _Leydenia\r\ngemmipara_ is connected with abnormal conditions of _Chlamydophrys_,\r\noccasionally occurring as a commensal in the ascitic fluid. The form is\r\nproduced when pathological conditions of the large intestine create an\r\nalkaline reaction of its whole contents. The formation of shells then\r\noften ceases, and these naked _Chlamydophrys_ are enabled to multiply\r\natypically by division and gemmation. Such stages, which are no longer\r\ncapable of a normal development, are the _Leydenia_, as Schaudinn has\r\ndemonstrated.\r\n\r\n\r\nClass II. *MASTIGOPHORA*, Diesing.\r\n\r\nSub-Class. FLAGELLATA, Cohn emend. Bütschli.\r\n\r\n  During the motile part of their life the Flagellata possess one\r\n  or more flagella which serve for locomotion, and in many cases\r\n  also for the capture of food. A few groups (_Euglenoidinæ_,\r\n  _Choanoflagellata_) have only one flagellum, others two or several\r\n  of about equal length (_Isomastigoda_), or of various lengths\r\n  (_Monadina_, _Heteromastigoda_, _Dinoflagellata_). The long flagellum\r\n  is the principal one; the smaller ones on the same organism are\r\n  accessory flagella. The flagella directed backwards, which occur in\r\n  the Heteromastigoda and are used for clinging, are termed trailing\r\n  flagella or tractella. At the base of the flagellum, which is\r\n  almost always at the anterior end, a Choanoflagellate possesses a\r\n  cytoplasmic funnel-shaped neck or collar. In the parasitic forms an\r\n  undulating membrane is often present.\r\n\r\n  The body of the Flagellata is usually small, generally elongate and\r\n  of unchangeable form. It is frequently covered by a distinct cuticle,\r\n  and, in certain groups, by a hard envelope, or it may be more or\r\n  less loosely enveloped by a gelatinous or membranous covering. An\r\n  ectoplasmic layer is thin and not always obvious. The granular\r\n  cytoplasm contains a varying number of vacuoles, one of which may be\r\n  contractile, and is generally situated near the area from which the\r\n  flagella arise, that is, at the anterior extremity. The cytoplasm,\r\n  moreover, contains the nucleus, which is nearly always single; and in\r\n  many species there are also yellow, brown, or green chromatophores\r\n  of various shapes, such as occur in plants. Some species feed after\r\n  the manner of green plants (holophytic), or of plants devoid of\r\n  chlorophyll (saprophytic); others, again, ingest solid food, and\r\n  for this purpose usually possess a cytostome; the latter, however,\r\n  in a few forms is not used for its original function, but is\r\n  connected with the contractile vacuole. Many parasitic forms feed\r\n  by endosmosis. A few species possess eye-spots with or without\r\n  light-refracting bodies.\r\n\r\n  Variation in the form of the nuclear apparatus occurs. One nucleus\r\n  only, which may be compact or vesicular, is known in many species.\r\n  This nucleus is situated either centrally or sometimes near the\r\n  flagellar end of the body, but its position is subject to variation.\r\n  The flagella may arise near the nucleus. Other structures, such as\r\n  an axial filament and a rhizoplast, may be present. Some flagellates\r\n  are binucleate, the two nuclei--which often differ in size and\r\n  shape--being separated from each other. One of these nuclei is the\r\n  principal, vegetative or trophic nucleus; the other is an accessory\r\n  nucleus, frequently termed the blepharoplast, flagellar or kinetic\r\n  nucleus. One or more small basal granules are often present at or\r\n  very near the origin of the flagella.\r\n\r\n  Multiplication is by fission, usually longitudinal, which may occur\r\n  in either the free or encysted forms. Division is initiated by that\r\n  of the nucleus or nuclei (especially the kinetic nucleus). The\r\n  basal granule divides also. Collars and chromatophores, if present,\r\n  likewise separate into two. Variation in the method of doubling the\r\n  original number of flagella occurs. In most organisms, especially\r\n  uniflagellate forms, the flagellum splits lengthwise, after division\r\n  of the basal granule, blepharoplast and nucleus. The daughter\r\n  flagella may be of the same or different lengths and thicknesses.\r\n  Other flagellates at division are said to produce new flagella in the\r\n  neighbourhood of the original ones. The daughter organisms in such\r\n  cases are provided with one or more parental flagella in addition\r\n  to newly formed ones. It has been stated that in certain cases the\r\n  parent flagellate retains all its flagella, while new ones arise _ab\r\n  initio_ in the cytoplasm of the daughter forms.\r\n\r\n  Multiplication by longitudinal fission may be interrupted sooner or\r\n  later by the production of gametes, which form zygotes, from which\r\n  new generations of individuals arise. In many flagellates gamete\r\n  formation and sporogony are unknown, and asexual reproduction by\r\n  fission alone prevails.\r\n\r\n  Incomplete division results in the formation of colonies of\r\n  individuals. These colonies must not be confused with the aggregation\r\n  rosettes of flagellates found among the parasitic Mastigophora.\r\n  The individuals of aggregation rosettes are capable of immediate\r\n  separation from the rosette at will.\r\n\r\n  A number of parasitic Flagellata produce non-flagellate stages which\r\n  are very resistant to external conditions, the assumption of which\r\n  forms serves to protect the organisms during their transference\r\n  from one host to another. Such non-flagellate forms possess one\r\n  or more nuclei, are usually of an oval or rounded contour, and\r\n  are capable of developing into the full flagellate on the return\r\n  of more favourable conditions. These forms are often known as the\r\n  post-flagellate stage of the organism. When ingested by a new host,\r\n  the post-flagellate coat becomes more flexible, and the phase of the\r\n  organism which now recommences growth is known as the pre-flagellate\r\n  stage; it gradually develops into the typical flagellate organism.\r\n\r\n  Many Flagellata live free in fresh and salt water. They prefer\r\n  stagnant water, rich in organic products of decomposition, such as\r\n  puddles, swamps and pools. Those forms developing shells and colonies\r\n  are, as a rule, adherent. A number of species are parasitic in man\r\n  and animals, living mostly within the intestine or in the blood.\r\n\r\n  It is usual to classify the Flagellata in four orders:\r\n  _Euflagellata_, _Dinoflagellata_, _Choanoflagellata_, and\r\n  _Cystoflagellata_, of which only the _Euflagellata_ are of interest\r\n  to us. This is a group comprising numerous species, for the further\r\n  classification of which the number and position of the flagella are\r\n  utilised.\r\n\r\n  The Euflagellata observed in man belong to the Protomonadina as well\r\n  as to the Polymastigina. The former possess either only one or two\r\n  similar flagella, or one principal and one or two accessory flagella.\r\n  The Polymastigina possess at least three flagella of equal size,\r\n  or four to eight of unequal size, inserted at different points. An\r\n  undulating membrane may be present in members of both groups.\r\n\r\n  It must also be pointed out that unicellular organisms with one or\r\n  several flagella are not always classified with flagellates, for such\r\n  forms occur in Rhizopods as well as temporarily in the lower plants.\r\n  In addition, the examination of the flagellates, especially the\r\n  parasitic species, is very difficult on account of their diminutive\r\n  size and great activity; thus it happens that certain forms cannot\r\n  with certainty be included in the group because their description is\r\n  insufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder. *Polymastigina*, Blochmann.\r\n\r\nThe Polymastigina contains flagellates with three to eight flagella.\r\nSome of the Flagellata parasitic in man belong to the Polymastigina,\r\nand to two or three genera that are easily distinguishable.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Trichomonas*, Donné, 1837.\r\n\r\n  The body is generally pyriform, the anterior part usually rounded,\r\n  the posterior part pointed. There are at the anterior extremity three\r\n  (? four) equally long flagella that are sometimes matted together.\r\n  A blepharoplast (kinetic nucleus) and basal granule are present,\r\n  together with a supporting structure known as an axial filament or\r\n  axostyle. In addition there is an undulating membrane, bordered by\r\n  a trailing flagellum, that commences at the anterior extremity and\r\n  proceeds obliquely backwards. The nucleus, which is vesicular, is\r\n  situated near the anterior extremity, and behind it are one or more\r\n  vacuoles, none of which seems to be contractile. These flagellates\r\n  are parasitic in vertebrate animals, and live chiefly in the\r\n  intestine.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Trichomonas vaginalis*, Donné.\r\n\r\nThe form of the body is very variable, and is elongate, fusiform or\r\npear-shaped, also amœboid. The length varies between 15 µ and 25 µ,\r\nand the breadth between 7 µ and 12 µ. The posterior extremity is drawn\r\nout to a point and is about half the length of the remainder of the\r\nbody. The cuticle is very thin and the body substance finely granular.\r\nAt the anterior extremity there are three--some say four[36]--flagella\r\nof equal length which are frequently united together, at least at the\r\nbase, and are easily detached.\r\n\r\n[36] To explain this discrepancy it is stated that the border of the\r\nundulating membrane can be detached in the form of an independent\r\nflagellum. But Parisi (1910) places such quadriflagellate forms in the\r\nsub-genus _Tetratrichomonas_, _Arch. f. Protistenk._, xix, p. 232.\r\n\r\nThere is an undulating membrane (fig. 16) which runs spirally across\r\nthe body, arising from the place of insertion of the flagella, and\r\nterminating at the base of the caudal process. A cytostome seldom is\r\nrecognizable in fresh specimens, but is apparently present. The nucleus\r\nis vesicular, elliptical and situated near the anterior extremity.[37]\r\n\r\n[37] According to Marchand, the nucleus is connected with a line,\r\nwhich becomes visible on addition of acetic acid, terminates at the\r\nposterior extremity, and does not correspond to the line of insertion\r\nof the undulating membrane. This formation probably is the same as the\r\naxostyle in _Trichomonas batrachorum_, Perty. Blochmann (1884) also\r\nmentions two longitudinal rows of granules, which commence at the same\r\nplace as the nucleus and converge posteriorly.\r\n\r\nMultiplication takes place by division (Marchand). Encysted forms are\r\nalmost unknown.\r\n\r\n  _Trichomonas vaginalis_ lives in the vaginal mucus of women of\r\n  various ages, not in normal mucus, but in mucus of acid reaction.\r\n  It is found in menstruating females as well as in females who\r\n  have passed the menopause. It occurs in pregnant and non-pregnant\r\n  women, even in very young girls, provided always that they have a\r\n  vaginal catarrh with acid reaction of the secretion. Should the acid\r\n  reaction change, as, for instance, during menstruation, the parasites\r\n  disappear, as they do likewise on injection of any alkaline fluid\r\n  into the vagina. A low temperature (below +15° C.) is also fatal to\r\n  the parasites. These flagellates can pass from the vagina through the\r\n  urethra into the bladder, and produce severe catarrh, and are not\r\n  easily removed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--_Trichomonas vaginalis_, Donné. × 2,000\r\napprox. (After Künstler.) Four flagella are represented, but usually\r\nonly three are present.]\r\n\r\n_T. vaginalis_ appeared to be a parasite specific to the female organs\r\nand not transmissible to man. However, several observations have since\r\nbeen made that confirm the occurrence of this species in the urethra\r\nof the male. The infection apparently takes place through coitus when\r\nchanges are present in the urethral mucous membrane. At any rate, three\r\ncases observed point to this circumstance.\r\n\r\nAttempts at experimental transmission to rabbits, guinea-pigs and dogs\r\nfailed (Blochmann, Dock). So far, the manner in which women become\r\ninfected is unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Trichomonas intestinalis*, R. Leuckart, 1879 = *Trichomonas hominis*,\r\nDavaine, 1854.\r\n\r\nSome authors believe that a second trichomonad inhabiting man,\r\n_Trichomonas intestinalis_, R. Lkt., is identical with _Trichomonas\r\nvaginalis_, Donné. Leuckart’s species was based on the discoveries\r\nof Marchand (1875) and Zunker (1878), who stated that according to\r\nall appearances, and in their opinion, it was the same as _Cercomonas\r\nintestinalis_, Lambl, 1875 (_nec_ 1859), which they found in the fæces\r\nof patients suffering from intestinal disorders. The organism is\r\ndescribed by them as being pear-shaped and 10 µ to 15 µ in length and\r\n3 µ to 4 µ in breadth. The posterior extremity terminated in a point\r\n(fig. 17).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--_Trichomonas intestinalis_, Lkt. (After\r\nGrassi.)]\r\n\r\n  A row of twelve or more cilia was said to commence at the anterior\r\n  end and extend over the body. Leuckart stated that this parasite,\r\n  placed by the two authors in the genus _Cercomonas_, was a\r\n  _Trichomonas_, and that they mistook the undulating membrane for\r\n  cilia, and overlooked the flagella. Notwithstanding its striking\r\n  similarity with _T. vaginalis_, it was said to be distinguishable\r\n  from that species by differences in the undulating membrane. Lambl’s\r\n  _C. intestinalis_[38] (of 1875) which corresponds with _C. hominis_,\r\n  Davaine[39] (1854), is regarded by Leuckart as a true Cercomonad\r\n  (characterized by a flagellum and the absence of an undulating\r\n  membrane, see p. 61), and is thus generically distinct from\r\n  _Trichomonas_.\r\n\r\n[38] Under the term _Cercomonas intestinalis_, Lambl in different\r\nyears has described two entirely distinct Flagellata, namely, in 1859\r\n(“Mikr. Unters. d. Darm- Excrete,” _Prag. Vierteljahrsschr. f. prakt.\r\nHlkde._, lxi, p. 51; and Lambl, _A. d. Franz-Josephs-Kinderspitale in\r\nPrag_, Prag, 1860, i, p. 360), a form that at the present day is termed\r\n_Lamblia intestinalis_; and in 1875 (in the _Russian Medical Report_,\r\nNo. 33), a species identical with _Cercomonas hominis_, Dav.\r\n\r\n[39] Davaine, C., “Sur les anim. infus. trouv. dans les selles d.\r\nmalad. atteints du cholera et d’autr. malad.,” _C. R. Soc. Biol._,\r\n1854, ii, p. 129.\r\n\r\n  The correctness of Leuckart’s judgment in regard to Marchand-Zunker’s\r\n  flagellate was demonstrated by Grassi’s researches, accounts of which\r\n  were published soon after. In about 100 cases of bowel complaints\r\n  in North Italy and Sicily, Grassi found Flagellata in the stools,\r\n  which he first named _Monocercomonas_ and _Cimænomonas_, but later\r\n  termed _Trichomonas_. However, in opposition to Leuckart, Grassi\r\n  has also classified Davaine’s _C. hominis_ (= _C. intestinalis_,\r\n  Lambl, 1875) as _Trichomonas_, and most authors have followed his\r\n  example. Hence arose the use of the name _Trichomonas hominis_. It\r\n  was through Janowski (1896) that the former view was again taken\r\n  up. After a review of the literature, the occurrence of Cercomonads\r\n  in the intestine of human beings in addition to Trichomonads was\r\n  considered by the author to have been proved, and he added a\r\n  description of the Trichomonads. According to this, all morphological\r\n  distinction between _T. vaginalis_, Donné, and _T. intestinalis_,\r\n  Leuckart, disappeared. On the other hand, it is worthy of note\r\n  that the smaller size, the more pear-shaped form, and the longer\r\n  flagella differentiate _T. intestinalis_ (= _T. hominis_) from _T.\r\n  vaginalis_.[40]\r\n\r\n[40] For the present the following should be regarded as synonymous:\r\n_Protoryxomyces coprinarius_, Cunningham (_Quart. Journ. Micr. Sci._\r\n(2) 1880, xxi, p. 234), (_Zeitschr. f. Biol._, 1882, viii, p. 251).\r\n_Monocercomonas hominis_, Grassi, 1882. _Cimænomonas hominis_,\r\nGrassi, 1882. _Trichomonas hominis_, Grassi, 1888. _Cercomonas coli\r\nhominis_, May (_Deutsches Archiv. f. klin. med._, 1891, xlix, p. 51).\r\n_Monocercomonas hominis_, Epstein (_Prag. med. Wochenschr._ 1893,\r\nNos. 38–40). _Trichomonas confusa_, Stiles (_Zool. Anz._, 1902, xxv,\r\np. 689). _Trichomonas elongata_, _Trichomonas elliptica_, Cohnheim\r\n(_Deutsche med. Wochenschr._, 1903, xxix, Nos. 12–14). _Trichomonas\r\nelongata_, _Trichomonas caudata_, _Trichomonas flagellata_, Steinberg\r\n(_Kiewer Zeitschr. f. neuere Medicin_, 1862). _Trichomonas pulmonalis_,\r\nA. Schmidt, (_Münch. med. Wochenschr._, 1895, No. 51), and St. Artault\r\n(_Arch. de parasit._ 1898, i, p. 279).\r\n\r\nThe easily deformed pear-shaped body has three free flagella\r\nanteriorly, and an undulating membrane with its flagellar border\r\nterminating in a short free flagellum posteriorly (figs. 17, 18).\r\nThe undulating membrane may coil itself spirally round the body. A\r\nsupporting rod or axostyle projects as a posterior spine. It appears\r\nto begin near the nucleus and blepharoplast, which are situated near\r\nthe more rounded, anterior end of the body. There may be a chromatoid\r\nbasal supporting line along the body for the undulating membrane. Rows\r\nof chromatoid granules are sometimes situated along one side of the\r\naxostyle. A cytostome may sometimes be seen. In mice, Wenyon (1907)\r\nfound these parasites to vary in length from 3 µ to 20 µ. They occur\r\nin the cæcum and intestine of mice, where their internal structure\r\nseems more obvious than in man. The flagellates divide by longitudinal\r\nfission.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--_Trichomonas intestinalis_ from man, showing\r\nanterior flagella, cytostomic depression anteriorly, undulating\r\nmembrane, nuclei, and axostyle. ×2,500. Original.]\r\n\r\n_T. intestinalis_, R. Leuckart, appears to be capable of settling\r\nin all parts of the human intestine in which the contents have an\r\nalkaline reaction. Trichomonads have been cited as occurring in the\r\noral cavity by Steinberg, Zunker, Rappin and Prowazek; in the œsophagus\r\nby Cohnheim, and in the stomach by Strube, Cohnheim, Zabel, Hensen\r\nand Rosenfeld. The normal situation seems to be the small intestine.\r\nThe parasites then appear in the dejecta, especially in various\r\nintestinal diseases the course of which is connected with an increased\r\nperistalsis. They are also found in healthy persons, from whom they are\r\nobtained after the administration of laxatives. They have been regarded\r\nby some workers as commensals, which, however, have the power of\r\naccelerating the onset of intestinal complaints, or at least of adding\r\nto them. They have been found in cases of carcinoma of the stomach, and\r\nin other diseases of that organ in which the acid reaction ceased.\r\n\r\n  Naturally, whether all the reports relate to the same species of\r\n  Trichomonas must remain undecided. Certain authors (Steinberg,\r\n  Cohnheim, van Emden) accept several species. Prowazek speaks of a\r\n  variety of _T. intestinalis_ inhabiting the oral cavity. This was\r\n  distinguished by a posterior process exceeding the length of the\r\n  body fourfold, and by a somewhat unusual course of the undulating\r\n  membrane. The food of this form, which was found in the whitish\r\n  deposit present, especially in the cavities of carious teeth,\r\n  consisted almost exclusively of micrococci. Schmidt and St. Artault\r\n  named the Trichomonads found in pathological products (_e.g._,\r\n  gangrene, putrid bronchitis, phthisis) of the lungs of man, as\r\n  _Trichomonas pulmonalis_. Trichomonads have also been found by\r\n  Wieting in lobular pneumonia in the lungs of pigs.\r\n\r\n  It is still uncertain in what way the infection takes place.\r\n  Experiments in the transmission of free trichomonads to mammals (_per\r\n  os_), in which the same or allied species occur (guinea-pigs, rats,\r\n  apes), have been without result. Probably encystment is necessary.\r\n  Such conditions are mentioned by May, Künstler, Roos, Schurmayer, van\r\n  Emden, Prowazek, Galli-Valerio and Schaudinn. According to Prowazek,\r\n  intestinal trichomonads of rats become encysted for conjugation. In\r\n  the cyst an accumulation of reserve food material occurs, causing\r\n  distension. The nuclei of the conjugants each give off a reduction\r\n  body and, after fusion, produce the nuclei for the daughter\r\n  individuals. According to Schaudinn the intestinal trichomonads lose\r\n  their flagella before conjugation, become amœboid and encyst in\r\n  twos, the formation of a large agglomeration of reserve substance\r\n  accompanying this. Galli-Valerio found double-contoured cysts in\r\n  the fæces of trichomonad-infected guinea-pigs, after the fæces had\r\n  been kept for a month in a damp chamber. When exposed to heat small\r\n  flagellates escaped from them. Administration of such material\r\n  containing cysts resulted in severe infection with trichomonads,\r\n  and death of the experimental guinea-pigs followed. The cyst wall\r\n  is clearly a protection against the deleterious acid reaction of\r\n  the stomach contents. Alexeieff (1911) and Brumpt (1912) think that\r\n  the trichomonad cysts of man are really fungi, while other workers\r\n  also doubt encystment among trichomonads. Wenyon (1907) states that\r\n  _T. intestinalis_ in mice produces spherical contracted forms which\r\n  escape from the body in the fæces.\r\n\r\n  Air, water, and under certain circumstances even food may be regarded\r\n  as vectors for the trichomonads. The occurrence of the organisms in\r\n  the oral cavity, and still more so in the lungs, is in favour of the\r\n  air being the transmitting agent. An observation made by Epstein\r\n  supports the idea of water transmission. Multiplication of the\r\n  trichomonads, once they have gained access to the body, is effected\r\n  by longitudinal division commencing at the anterior end (Künstler).\r\n  “Cercomonads” with several flagella and an undulating membrane, as\r\n  well as trichomonads, have been observed by Ross in some cases of\r\n  cutaneous ulcers.\r\n\r\nMello-Leitao (1913)[41] has described flagellate dysentery in children\r\nin Rio de Janeiro. He states that it is due to _T. intestinalis_ and\r\n_Lamblia intestinalis_ either separately or together. Flagellate\r\ndysentery, he thinks, is benign and is the most frequent form of\r\ndysentery in infants. The flagellates are pathogenic to infants under\r\nthree years of age. Escomel (1913)[42] found 152 cases of dysentery in\r\nPeru due solely to Trichomonas. Such cases are probably widespread.\r\n\r\n[41] _Brit. Journ. Children’s Diseases_, x, p. 60.\r\n\r\n[42] _Bull.

There are\r\nthree anterior flagella. The pear-shaped organism measures 14 µ by 7 µ,\r\nbut smaller examples occur. _T. mesnili_ occurs in the human intestine,\r\nhaving been described by Wenyon[43] (1910) from a man from the Bahamas\r\nin the Seamen’s Hospital, London. Its occurrence is widespread.\r\nAlexeieff considers that _Macrostoma_ and _Tetramitus_ are synonymous.\r\nThe parasite is the same as _Fanapapea intestinalis_, Prowazek, 1911,\r\nfrom Samoa. Brumpt (1912) found _T. mesnili_ to be the causal agent of\r\ncolitis in a Frenchwoman. Nattan-Larrier (1912) considers it of little\r\npathological importance.\r\n\r\n[43] _Parasitology_, iii, p. 210.\r\n\r\nGäbel[44] (1914) described an interesting case of seasonal diarrhœa\r\nacquired in Tunis, in which a new Tetramitid was the causal agent. The\r\norganism was pear-shaped, without an undulating membrane, and measured\r\n6·5 µ to 8 µ by 5 µ to 6 µ. The cytostome was large, and there was\r\nno skeletal support. Encystment occurred. Gäbel named the organism\r\n_Difämus tunensis_ and considered that it was pathogenic.\r\n\r\n[44] _Arch. f. Protistenk._, xxxiv, p. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Lamblia*, R.

It has four pairs of flagella directed backwards, of\r\n  which three pairs lie on the borders of the hollow disc, and the\r\n  fourth arises from the pointed posterior extremity.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Lamblia intestinalis*, Lambl, 1859.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Cercomonas intestinalis_, Lambl, 1859 (_nec_ 1875); _Hexamitus\r\n  duodenalis_, Davaine, 1875; _Dimorphus muris_, Grassi, 1879;\r\n  _Megastoma entericum_, Grassi, 1881; _Megastoma intestinale_, R.\r\n  Blanch., 1886; _Lamblia duodenalis_, Stiles, 1902.\r\n\r\nThe organism is pear-shaped and bilaterally symmetrical. It is from\r\n10 µ to 21 µ long and 5 µ to 12 µ broad and possesses a thin cuticle.\r\nAnteriorly an oblique depression is present, which functions as a\r\nsucking disc (fig. 19, _s_). Its edges are raised above the general\r\nsurface and are contractile. It corresponds to a peristome and acts as\r\nan adhesive organ (fig. 20, _b_, _c_). No true cytostome is present.\r\nA double longitudinal ridge, representing axostyles, extends from the\r\nsucking disc to the tapering posterior extremity, which is prolonged as\r\ntwo flagella from 9 µ to 14 µ long.\r\n\r\n_Lamblia intestinalis_ possesses eight flagella (fig. 19). The first\r\npair of flagella, which cross one another, arise in a groove formed by\r\nthe anterior edge of the sucking disc. Two pairs of flagella (lateral\r\nand median) are inserted on the posterior edge of the disc, while the\r\nposterior flagella occur at the tapering posterior extremity of the\r\nbody. Basal granules are found at the bases of the flagella. The median\r\nflagella are most active in movement, the anterior and lateral flagella\r\nbeing less motile, as they are partially united to the body for part of\r\ntheir length.\r\n\r\nThe nuclear apparatus is situated in the thin, anterior, hollowed\r\npart of the body. It is at first dumb-bell shaped, the “handle” of\r\nthe dumb-bell being formed by a very slight connecting strand, which\r\neventually separates, so that the flagellate becomes binucleate, and\r\nthus completes the general bisymmetry of the organism.\r\n\r\nThere is a karyosome in each nucleus. Other bodies of unknown function,\r\nand possibly composed of chromatin, occur on or near the axostyles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--_Lamblia intestinalis_. A, ventral view; B,\r\nside view; N, one of the two nuclei; _ax._, axostyles; _fl_^1, _fl_^2,\r\n_fl_^3, _fl_^4, the four pairs of flagella; _s_, sucker-like depressed\r\narea on the ventral surface; _x_, bodies of unknown function. (After\r\nWenyon.)]\r\n\r\nDivision has not been observed in the flagellate stages of the Lamblia,\r\nbut it occurs within the cysts. The resistant cysts (fig. 20, _e_) are\r\noval and are surrounded by a fairly thick, hyaline cyst wall. They\r\nmeasure 10 µ to 15 µ by 7 µ to 9 µ, and may be tetranucleate. According\r\nto Schaudinn, the cysts arise from the conjugation of two individuals,\r\nand nuclear rearrangement occurs.\r\n\r\n_L. intestinalis_ occurs in its flagellate stage in the duodenum and\r\njejunum, and rarely as such in the other parts of the intestine.\r\nNormally it is found in the large intestine as cysts, which are voided\r\nwith the fæces. The hosts of Lamblia include _Mus musculus_, _M.\r\nrattus_, _M. decumanus_, _M. silvestris_, _Arvicola arvensis_ and _A.\r\namphibius_, the dog and cat, rabbit, sheep and man. Cysts voided with\r\nthe fæces of infected animals reach plants or drinking water, and\r\nthence are transferred to man.\r\n\r\nThe flagellate in these different hosts exhibits some variation in\r\nsize and in the problematic chromatic bodies. Bensen has suggested the\r\nspecies _L. intestinalis_ from man, _L. muris_ from the mouse and _L.\r\ncuniculi_ from the rabbit. It is not certain whether these different\r\nspecies are necessary, as the variation may be due to differences of\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--_Lamblia intestinalis._ _a_, from the surface;\r\n_b_, from the side; _c_, on intestinal epithelium cells; _d_, dead and\r\n_e_, encysted. (After Grassi and Schewiakoff.)]\r\n\r\nLike Trichomonas, Lamblia can multiply under inflammatory conditions\r\nof the alimentary tract. Thus they are found in cases of diarrhœa,\r\ncarcinoma of the stomach, etc. The parasites attach themselves by\r\ntheir sucking discs to the epithelial cells of the gut (fig. 20, _c_),\r\nand though their numbers may be very great, their direct pathological\r\nsignificance is not fully known. Their occurrence in cases of diarrhœa\r\nhas been explained as being due to the increased peristalsis, which\r\nhas detached the parasites from the epithelium. Free flagellate forms\r\nperish in stools if kept, more especially if the temperature falls\r\nbelow 0° C. or rises above 40° C. Lamblia has often been found in\r\ndysenteric diseases, especially in the East, and is said to be the\r\ncausal agent of certain diarrhœas in India. Mathis (1914)[45] found\r\nLamblia in cases of diarrhœa with dysenteriform stools in Tonkin. He\r\nalso discovered healthy carriers of Lamblia cysts.\r\n\r\n[45] _Bull. Soc. Med. Chirurg. Indo-Chine_, v, p. 55.\r\n\r\n  The parasite under discussion was first observed by Lambl (1859) in\r\n  the mucous evacuations of children. He regarded the parasite as a\r\n  Cercomonad and termed it _Cercomonas intestinalis_, which name as a\r\n  rule is applied to _Cercomonas hominis_, Davaine, although Stein had\r\n  already pointed out the difference between the two species. Grassi\r\n  (1879) observed this species first in mice (calling it _Dimorphus\r\n  muris_), and subsequently in human beings in Upper Italy and named\r\n  it _Megastoma entericum_. Bütschli and Blanchard then laid stress on\r\n  the identity of this species with Lambl’s _C. intestinalis_ (1859),\r\n  and consequently called it _Megastoma intestinale_. Later, Blanchard\r\n  drew attention to the circumstance that the generic name _Megastoma_\r\n  chosen by Grassi had already been used four times for various kinds\r\n  of animals, and established the genus _Lamblia_. Accordingly, _L.\r\n  intestinalis_ is the valid name, and should be generally adopted.\r\n\r\n  In Upper Italy the parasite in the encysted condition has also\r\n  been seen by Perroncito in man. At the same time, Grassi and\r\n  Schewiakoff began a new investigation of specimens from mice and\r\n  rats. In Germany, _L. intestinalis_ was found by Moritz and Hölzl,\r\n  Roos, Schuberg and Salomon. Moritz and Hölzl confirmed the relative\r\n  frequency of the species. In Königsberg, Prussia, a student found\r\n  encysted _Lamblia_ in his fæces. One case was reported from Finland\r\n  by Sievers, another case from Scandinavia by Müller. Frshezjesski and\r\n  Ucke reported cases from Russia. Jaksch announced the occurrence of\r\n  the parasite in Austria; Piccardi mentioned their presence again in\r\n  Italy. They were reported from Egypt by Kruse and Pasquale, and from\r\n  North America (Baltimore) by Stiles. Noc stated that 50 per cent. of\r\n  the population of Tonkin harboured _Lamblia_. Finally, the structure\r\n  of _L. intestinalis_ has been described by Metzner (1901), and by\r\n  Wenyon[46] (1907) in mice.\r\n\r\n[46] _Arch. f. Protistenkunde_, Suppl. i, p. 169.\r\n\r\nIn all these cases _L. intestinalis_ has been observed in the small\r\nintestine, or in the evacuations of patients with intestinal diseases.\r\nIt has also been found in the intestine of healthy subjects. Just\r\nas _Trichomonas intestinalis_ may be found inhabiting the stomach\r\nin diseases of that organ, in which an alkaline reaction is present\r\n(carcinoma), so has _L. intestinalis_ been found to occur under\r\nsimilar circumstances (Cohnheim, Zabel). However, in Schmidt’s case,\r\n1 per cent. hydrochloric acid was certainly stated to be present.\r\nInfection takes place by the ingestion of cysts (fig. 20, _e_), as was\r\nestablished by Grassi, experimentally on himself. Cereal food-stuffs,\r\ncontaminated with Lamblia cysts from vermin of the locality, such as\r\nrats and mice, serve to convey the infection to man. Such cysts may\r\nprobably be found in street-dust, etc. Stiles induced infection in\r\nguinea-pigs, and Perroncito in mice and rabbits, by means of cysts of\r\nLamblia from human beings. Stiles suspected that flies could transport\r\nLamblia cysts. Mathis (1914) found that _L. intestinalis_ was not\r\namenable to emetine, at any rate in its cystic stage.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder. *Protomonadina*, Blochmann.\r\n\r\nThe smallness of the Protomonadines and their less superficial\r\nsituation than the Polymastigines, may be the cause that so far as\r\nthe species occurring in man are concerned, they were formerly less\r\nwell known. As regards parasitic species, this group may be divided\r\nas follows, according to the number of flagella and the presence or\r\nabsence of an undulating membrane:--\r\n\r\n(1) _Cercomonadidæ_, with one flagellum at the anterior extremity,\r\nwithout an undulating membrane.\r\n\r\n(2) _Bodonidæ_, with two flagella, without an undulating membrane,\r\nexcept in Trypanoplasma.\r\n\r\n(3) _Trypanosomidæ_, with one flagellum, and an undulating membrane\r\nalong the length of the body in some genera.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Cercomonadidæ*, Kent emend. Bütschli.\r\n\r\nSmall uniflagellate forms, without cytostome.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Cercomonas*, Dujardin emend. Bütschli.\r\n\r\nOval or rounded organisms, with the aflagellar end often drawn out into\r\na tail-like process.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Cercomonas hominis*, Davaine, 1854.\r\n\r\nDavaine found flagellates in the dejecta of cholera patients. They\r\nhad pear-shaped bodies, lengthening to a point posteriorly. Their\r\nlength was from 10 µ to 12 µ, and a flagellum about twice as long as\r\nthe body projected from one extremity (fig. 21). A nucleus was hardly\r\nrecognizable. Occasionally a somewhat long structure (cytostome?)\r\nappeared at the anterior extremity. The animals moved with remarkable\r\nactivity. They also attached themselves by means of their posterior\r\nextremities and swung about around the point of attachment. Davaine\r\nfound a smaller variety, only about 8 µ long, in the dejecta of a\r\ntyphoid patient (fig. 21, _b_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--_Cercomonas hominis_, Dav. _a_, larger,\r\n_b_, smaller variety. Enlarged. (After Davaine.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--_Cercomonas hominis_, Dav. From an\r\nEchinococcus cyst. (After Lambl.)]\r\n\r\n  The Flagellata observed by Ekeckrantz (1869) in the intestine of\r\n  man belong to this form--at least to the larger variety--and Tham\r\n  (1870) reported fresh cases soon after. Lambl’s publication of 1875,\r\n  which was written in Russian, and became known through Leuckart’s\r\n  work on parasites, also alludes to apparently typical Cercomonads,\r\n  which, however, were discovered, not in the intestine, but in an\r\n  _Echinococcus_ cyst in the liver (fig. 22). The elliptical, fusiform,\r\n  rarely pear-shaped or cylindrical bodies of the parasites measured\r\n  5 µ to 14 µ in length, and were provided with a flagellum at one end,\r\n  while the other extremity usually terminated in a long point. An oral\r\n  aperture occurred at the base of the flagellum, and there were one or\r\n  two vacuoles near the posterior extremity. Longitudinal division was\r\n  also observed (fig. 22).\r\n\r\nAs already mentioned, this form, which Lambl termed _Cercomonas\r\nintestinalis_, differs considerably from the form found by the same\r\nauthor in 1859, which received the same designation (_cf. Lamblia\r\nintestinalis_, p. 60), but it corresponds with _Cercomonas hominis_,\r\nDavaine. The latter, as well as _C. intestinalis_, Lambl, 1875, is\r\nusually classed with the Trichomonads, but, as has already been\r\nremarked (_cf._ _Trichomonas intestinalis_, p. 54), this cannot be\r\nconsidered correct, as only _one_ flagellum is present.\r\n\r\n_Cercomonas vaginalis_ (Castellani and Chalmers, 1909) was found in the\r\nvagina of native women in Ceylon.\r\n\r\nOther species of _Cercomonas_ have, at various times, been recorded\r\nfrom man. However, the parasitic species of the genus _Cercomonas_\r\nrequire further investigation.\r\n\r\n  According to Janowski (1896–7), typical Cercomonads have also been\r\n  observed in the intestine of man by Escherich, also by Cahen,\r\n  Massiutin, Fenoglio, Councilman and Lafleur, Dock, Kruse and\r\n  Pasquale, Zunker, Quincke and Roos, and others. However, it is an\r\n  open question whether the Flagellata observed by Roos in one of his\r\n  cases belonged to Davaine’s species, the size showing some deviation\r\n  (14 µ to 16 µ). In his, as in many other cases, doubts have been\r\n  raised as to whether the flagellates found in the stools had actually\r\n  lived in the intestine, or had subsequently appeared in the fæces:\r\n  for this a surprisingly short time only is necessary. Salomon also\r\n  appears to have observed Cercomonads (_Berl. klin. Wochenschr._,\r\n  1899, No. 46).\r\n\r\n  As with _T. intestinalis_ so with _C. hominis_, it appears that\r\n  the parasite settles not only in the intestine but also in the\r\n  air-passages. This is demonstrated by the statements of Kannenberg\r\n  and Streng of the occurrence of Monads and Cercomonads in the\r\n  sputum and putrid expectoration in gangrene of the lungs, which no\r\n  doubt apply to _C. hominis_ (_cf._ also Artault). Possibly also the\r\n  Flagellata observed in the pleural exudation by Litten and Roos may\r\n  be included here; this is the more probable in Roos’s case as the\r\n  process ensued in the pleura after the breaking through of a vomica.\r\n\r\n  Perroncito and Piccardi have described encysted stages of Cercomonads.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Monas pyophila*, R. Blanch., 1895.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--_Monas pyophila_, R. Blanch. (After Grimm.)]\r\n\r\n  R. Blanchard thus designates a Flagellate that Grimm found in the\r\n  sputum, as well as in the pus of a pulmonary and hepatic abscess,\r\n  in the case of a Japanese woman living in Sapporo. The parasites\r\n  resemble large spermatozoa (fig. 23). The body, 30 µ to 60 µ, has\r\n  the shape of a heart or a myrtle leaf, and is surrounded by a thick\r\n  cuticle which is supposed to extend into the interior of the body,\r\n  dividing it into three parts. A long appendix at the rounded pole\r\n  is covered for the greater part of its length by the cuticle; the\r\n  extremity, however, is free and resembles a flagellum. The parasites\r\n  were very active, frequently changed their shape, and were able to\r\n  retract the long appendix within the body, which then assumed a round\r\n  form.\r\n\r\n  [This organism requires further investigation.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Bodonidæ*, Bütschli.\r\n\r\n_Protomonadina_ which are either free-living or parasitic, with two\r\ndissimilar flagella, while the possession of an undulating membrane and\r\nof a kinetic nucleus or blepharoplast is variable.\r\n\r\nThere are three genera:--\r\n\r\n  1. _Bodo_, Stein, 1878, without a kinetic nucleus and undulating\r\n  membrane.\r\n\r\n  2. _Prowazekia_, Hartmann and Chagas, 1910, with a kinetic\r\n  nucleus and without an undulating membrane.\r\n\r\n  3. _Trypanoplasma_, Laveran and Mesnil, 1901, with a kinetic\r\n  nucleus and undulating membrane.\r\n\r\nOf these genera _Prowazekia_ must be discussed. _Bodo_ does not occur\r\nin man. Species of _Trypanoplasma_ occur in the blood and in the gut\r\nof various fishes, in the seminal receptacle of certain snails, in\r\nthe gut and genitalia of a flatworm (_Dendrocœlum lacteum_) and in\r\nthe vagina of a leech. Closely allied to _Trypanoplasma_ is the genus\r\n_Trypanophis_, parasitic in the cœlenteric cavity of Siphonophores.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Prowazekia*, Hartmann and Chagas, 1910.\r\n\r\nThe genus was founded for a flagellate parasite, _Prowazekia cruzi_,\r\ndiscovered in a culture of human fæces in Brazil. Various other species\r\nhave been referred thereto. The genus is separated from _Bodo_ by\r\nthe possession of a second nucleus, the so-called kinetonucleus or\r\nblepharoplast. It differs from _Trypanoplasma_ in the absence of an\r\nundulating membrane. It is heteromastigote, that is, it possesses two\r\ndissimilar flagella, one anteriorly directed and the other lateral and\r\ntrailing.\r\n\r\nThe principal species are:\r\n\r\n\r\n*Prowazekia urinaria*, Hassall, 1859.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Bodo urinarius_, Hassall, 1859; _Trichomonas irregularis_,\r\n  Salisbury, 1868; _Cystomonas urinaria_, Blanchard, 1885; _Plagiomonas\r\n  urinaria_, Braun, 1895.\r\n\r\nHassall[47] in 1859 first found Bodo-like flagellates in human urine.\r\nHe examined fifty samples of urine from patients suffering from\r\nalbuminuria and from cholera. The reaction of the urine was alkaline\r\nor sometimes only feebly acid. The flagellates were only seen after\r\nthe urine had been standing for several days. Hassall named the\r\norganism _Bodo urinarius_, and gave a very good description of it\r\nwith illustrations. The flagellate, which was round or oval, measured\r\n14 µ by 8 µ. The organism had “one, usually two, and sometimes three\r\nlashes or cilia.” In 1868 Salisbury described a similar flagellate in\r\nthe urine under the name _Trichomonas irregularis_. Künstler in 1883\r\ndescribed the latter parasite under the name _B. urinarius_. In 1885\r\nBlanchard, considering Künstler’s organism a different parasite from\r\nHassall’s, called it _Cystomonas urinaria_. Braun, in 1895, gave the\r\nname _Plagiomonas urinaria_. Barrois (1894) considered Künstler’s and\r\nHassall’s organisms to be identical and not to be true parasites of\r\nman. Sinton,[48] in 1912, found the flagellate in the deposit, after\r\ncentrifuging, of a 24-hour old specimen of alkaline urine from a\r\nMexican sailor in the Royal Southern Hospital, Liverpool. Sinton found\r\na kinetic nucleus or blepharoplast in the organism, and therefore\r\nplaced it in the genus _Prowazekia_.\r\n\r\n[47] _Lancet_, 1859, ii, p. 503.\r\n\r\n[48] _Annals Trop. Med. and Parasitology_, vi, p. 245.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--Types of _Prowazekia urinaria_. (_a_)\r\nsausage-shaped; (_b_) round; (_c_) carrot-shaped form. (After Sinton.)]\r\n\r\nThe flagellate stage (fig. 24) of the organism is polymorphic, and\r\nmay be either (_a_) sausage-shaped, 10 µ to 25 µ in length by 2·5 µ\r\nto 6 µ in breadth; (_b_) round or oval, varying from 4 µ in diameter\r\nto oval forms 15 µ by 10 µ; (_c_) a carrot-shaped form, of varying\r\nsize up to 25 µ by 4 µ. The kinetic nucleus is large and pear-shaped.\r\nNear it are basal granules, closely applied to one another, from which\r\nthe flagella arise. There is a small cytostome near the roots of the\r\nflagella. There is a well-marked karyosome in the nucleus. The movement\r\nis jerky. The shorter, anterior flagellum may be used in food-capture.\r\nIn life, bacteria have been seen to be ingested. Food-vacuoles tend to\r\naccumulate at the posterior (aflagellar) end. A contractile vacuole\r\nmay be present, near the base of the cytostome, and may really be the\r\ndilated fundus of the latter. Division occurs by binary fission. The\r\norganism can encyst (fig. 25, _a_), when the flagella are lost, and\r\nround or oval cysts are found, 5 µ to 7 µ in diameter. After a time\r\nflagella are formed inside the cyst, and the organism emerges therefrom\r\nin its typical flagellate form (fig. 25, _b_-_f_).\r\n\r\nSinton’s case is interesting. He obtained the flagellate only twice\r\nfrom the same patient, a Mexican then in hospital in Liverpool. The\r\nflagellate was not found in the patient’s fæces, nor was it found in\r\nthe urine on later occasions when taken aseptically.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--_Prowazekia urinaria_. Flagellate emerging\r\nfrom cyst. (After Sinton.)]\r\n\r\nIn cultures _Prowazekia urinaria_ was always found in association with\r\nbacteria. The cultures died at a temperature of 37° C., but grew well\r\nat 20° C. Various media were useful at the lower temperature, such as\r\nurine, salt agar, nutrient agar, serum agar, blood agar, peptone salt\r\nsolution, and diluted blood serum. The flagellate was, then, considered\r\nto be an accidental contamination and not a true parasite of human\r\nurine.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Prowazekia asiatica*, Castellani and Chalmers, 1910.\r\n\r\nThe flagellate was found by the discoverers in the stools of patients\r\nsuffering from ankylostomiasis and diarrhœa in Ceylon. It was referred\r\nby them to the genus _Bodo_, but in 1911 Whitmore[49] further studied\r\nit and placed it in the genus _Prowazekia_. In the stools the\r\nflagellate is found either as a long, slender form measuring 10 µ to\r\n16 µ by 5 µ to 8 µ or as a rounded form 8 µ to 10 µ in diameter. Its\r\ncytoplasm is alveolar. A rhizoplast connects the basal granules to the\r\nkinetic nucleus. There is multiplication and cyst formation as before.\r\nThe organism is easily cultivated, especially in the condensation water\r\nof nutrose agar and maltose agar. The pathogenicity is stated to be nil.\r\n\r\n[49] _Arch. f. Protistenk._ xxii, p. 370.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Prowazekia javanensis*, Flu, 1912.\r\n\r\nFound in agar cultures from the motions of patients at Weltevreden,\r\nDutch East Indies.[50] The flagellates are 12 µ long and 5 µ broad. The\r\nlateral flagellum is stated to be attached to the cell body for a short\r\ndistance. Regarding the karyosome in the nucleus, the author states\r\nthat the smaller the karyosome the more chromatin is deposited on the\r\nnuclear membrane. Flu mentions that the specific name _javanensis_ is a\r\ntemporary one, as in the course of time it may be shown that there is\r\nonly one species of _Prowazekia_.\r\n\r\n[50] _Geneesk. Tijdschr. v. Nederl. Ind._, lii, p. 659; _Med. v. d.\r\nBurg. Geneesk. d. Nederl. Ind._, iii, p. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Prowazekia cruzi*, Hartmann and Chagas, 1910.\r\n\r\nFound in a culture from human fæces on an agar plate in Brazil, and\r\nconsidered to be a free-living form.[51] The organism is oval or\r\npear-shaped, 8 µ to 12 µ long and 5 µ to 6 µ broad. In human stools\r\nat Tsingtau, China, a _Prowazekia_ has been found by Martini which he\r\nthinks is the same as _Prowazekia cruzi_. He considers it to be a cause\r\nof human diarrhœa and intestinal catarrh.\r\n\r\n[51] _Mem. Inst. Osw. Cruz._, ii, p. 64.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Prowazekia weinbergi*, Mathis and Léger, 1910.\r\n\r\nThis species was found in the fæces of men, both healthy and diarrhœic,\r\nin Tonkin.[52] It is pear-shaped, 8 µ to 15 µ long by 4 µ to 6·5 µ\r\nbroad. The flagella occur at the broad end.\r\n\r\n[52] _Bull. Soc. Med. Chir. Indo-Chine_, i, p. 471.\r\n\r\nThe discoverers think that _Prowazekia weinbergi_ is an intestinal\r\ninhabitant, but non-pathogenic, since it was found to occur in the\r\nfæces even when obtained with aseptic precautions.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Prowazekia parva*, Nägler, 1910.\r\n\r\nA free-living form found in the slime on the stones at the biological\r\nstation at Lunz. Another _Prowazekia_ was found in 1914 in tap-water in\r\nCalcutta.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Trypanosomidæ*, Doflein.\r\n\r\nThe Trypanosomidæ, broadly considered, are uniflagellate organisms,\r\nthe flagellum being at the anterior end. The flagellum arises near the\r\nblepharoplast (kinetic nucleus), which lies anterior, near or posterior\r\nto the nucleus.\r\n\r\nThe following genera will be considered:--\r\n\r\n  _Trypanosoma_--with an undulating membrane along the length\r\n  of the body.\r\n\r\n  _Crithidia_--with a less well-developed undulating membrane\r\n  anteriorly (see fig. 49).\r\n\r\n  _Herpetomonas_--including the so-called _Leptomonas_, with anterior\r\n  free flagellum only, and no undulating membrane.\r\n\r\n  _Leishmania_--non-flagellate forms in mammalian blood, flagellate\r\n  herpetomonad stages in culture, probably occurring\r\n  naturally in Arthropods.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Trypanosoma*, Gruby, 1843.\r\n\r\nThe members of the genus possess a single flagellum, which arises\r\nposteriorly, adjacent to a blepharoplast or kinetic nucleus. The\r\nflagellum forms a margin to an undulating membrane, and may or may not\r\nbe continued beyond the body as a free flagellum. Many species are\r\nparasitic in vertebrate blood and in the digestive tracts of insects.\r\n\r\n  HISTORICAL.\r\n\r\n  The history of blood flagellates goes back to the year 1841, in which\r\n  Valentin discovered in the blood of a brook-trout (_Salmo fario_ L.)\r\n  minute bodies, from 7 µ to 13 µ in length, with active movements and\r\n  presenting marked changes in form. Valentin considered the parasite\r\n  a new species of the old genus _Proteus_ or _Amœba_, Ehrbg. This\r\n  announcement led Gluge (1842) to publish a similar discovery he had\r\n  made in frog’s blood. The latter forms were called by Mayer (1843)\r\n  _Amœba rotatoria_, _Paramœcium loricatum_ and _P. costatum_, while\r\n  Gruby (1843) called them _Trypanosoma sanguinis_.[53] Later it was\r\n  discovered that similar organisms occurred also in the blood of birds\r\n  (Wedl (1850), Danilewsky) and of mammals. Gros (1845) found them in\r\n  the mouse and mole, Chaussat (1850) in the house rat, Lewis (1879) in\r\n  the Indian rat, Wittich (1881) in the hamster. Danilewsky (1886–89)\r\n  and Chalachnikow (1888) investigated the structure and division of\r\n  trypanosomes.\r\n\r\n[53] Gruby’s generic name is generally accepted. Still others have\r\nbeen used, _e.g._, _Undulina_, Ray _Lankester_, _Globularia_ Wedl,\r\n_Paramecioides_ Grassi, _Trypanomonas_ Danilewsky, _Hæmatomonas_\r\nMitrophanow.\r\n\r\n  In the case of all these forms, there was no discussion as to a\r\n  pathogenic influence on the host. Opinion, however, as to the action\r\n  of trypanosomes changed when, in 1880, Evans found flagellates in\r\n  the blood of horses in India that suffered from a disease endemic\r\n  there called “surra,” and associated the parasites with the disease.\r\n  Steel and Evans were successful in transmitting the parasites--first\r\n  known as _Spirochæta evansi_, Steel, then as _Trichomonas evansi_,\r\n  Crookshank, and finally as _Trypanosoma evansi_--to dogs, mules and\r\n  horses. They recognized that the above mentioned flagellates in the\r\n  blood of the experimental animals were the causal agents of the\r\n  disease.\r\n\r\n  From that time there was a considerable increase in the literature,\r\n  the contents of which have been summarized by Laveran and Blanchard.\r\n  In 1894 Rouget discovered trypanosomes in the blood of African horses\r\n  that suffer from “stallion’s disease” (dourine). In 1894 Bruce\r\n  found similar forms (_T. brucei_) in the blood of South African\r\n  mammals suffering from “nagana,” and in consequence attention was\r\n  drawn to the part which the much dreaded tsetse-fly played in the\r\n  transmission of “nagana.” In 1901 Elmassian discovered trypanosomes\r\n  in the blood of horses that were stricken with “mal de caderas,”\r\n  which is very common in the Argentine. The disease in cattle named\r\n  “galziekte” (gall-sickness), occurring in the Transvaal, was also at\r\n  one time attributed to a trypanosome remarkable for its great size,\r\n  and like some other species, bearing the name of its discoverer (_T.\r\n  theileri_).\r\n\r\n  The study of the species hitherto known has been carried on partly\r\n  by the above mentioned authors and in part by others, _e.g._,\r\n  Rabinowitsch and Kempner, Laveran and Mesnil, Wasiliewski, Senn.\r\n  It was greatly advanced by the method of double staining (with\r\n  alkaline methylene blue and eosin) introduced by Romanowsky (1891)\r\n  and elaborated by Ziemann, Leishman, Giemsa and others. By this means\r\n  the presence of a terminal flagellum and of an undulating membrane\r\n  at the side of the flattened and extended body was demonstrated.\r\n  Laveran and Mesnil (1901) discovered allied flagellates in the blood\r\n  of the fish, _Scardinius erythrophthalmus_. These flagellates, now\r\n  placed in the genus _Trypanoplasma_, had a second free flagellum in\r\n  addition to the one bordering the undulating membrane. Trypanoplasms\r\n  have since been found in both freshwater and marine fishes. The\r\n  transmission of trypanoplasms of freshwater fishes is effected by\r\n  leeches. _Trypanoplasma varium_ from _Cobitis_ is transmitted by\r\n  _Hemiclepsis marginata_ according to Léger, while the Trypanoplasmata\r\n  of _Cyprinus carpio_ and _Abramis brama_ reach new hosts by the\r\n  agency of _Piscicola_ according to Keysselitz.\r\n\r\n  Another ally of the Trypanosomidæ, _Trypanophis_, lives in the\r\n  cœlenteric cavity of Siphonophores. It has also an extra terminal\r\n  flagellum (Poche, Keysselitz). [_Trypanoplasma_ and _Trypanophis_\r\n  belong to the _Bodonidæ_, see p. 63].\r\n\r\n  Finally it was shown that Trypanosomes occurred in human beings.\r\n  Although Nepveu’s early report of trypanosomes in the blood of\r\n  malarial patients may be doubtful, subsequent researches by Forde\r\n  and Dutton demonstrated trypanosomes (fig. 28) in the blood of a\r\n  European, apparently suffering from malaria, living in the Gambia.\r\n  Dutton (1902) called the human trypanosome, _T. gambiense_. The\r\n  expedition despatched by the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine\r\n  (1902) to Senegambia found trypanosome infections in six cases among\r\n  a thousand inhabitants examined.\r\n\r\n  About the same time attention was devoted to the disease of West\r\n  African negroes known for a century as “sleeping sickness.”\r\n  Castellani (1903) was the first to succeed in demonstrating the\r\n  presence of trypanosomes (at first called _T. ugandense_) in\r\n  centrifugalized cerebro-spinal fluid obtained by puncture from cases\r\n  of sleeping sickness in Uganda. Similar discoveries were made by\r\n  Bruce, who also found trypanosomes in the blood of those attacked\r\n  with sleeping sickness. Sambon regarded a species of _Glossina_ as\r\n  the transmitter. From consideration of the geographical distribution\r\n  of the disease Christy regarded _Glossina palpalis_ as the\r\n  transmitter. Brumpt first thought it was _G. morsitans_, but, later,\r\n  supported the view of _G. palpalis_. Bruce, Nabarro and Greig also\r\n  named the same insect as the transmitter, not only for geographical\r\n  reasons but also because healthy apes became infected by the bite\r\n  of certain _G. palpalis_. The inoculation of cerebro-spinal fluid\r\n  from subjects of sleeping sickness into the spinal canal of apes\r\n  (_Macacus_) had the same result.\r\n\r\n  Just as the discovery of the malarial parasites called forth a whole\r\n  flood of research memoirs which were followed by a second series on\r\n  the relation of the mosquitoes to malaria, so a similar outpouring\r\n  occurred after the discovery of the pathogenic trypanosomes of\r\n  mammals and men. In both cases the inquiry was not limited to the\r\n  stages in man and other vertebrate hosts, but the fate of the\r\n  parasites in the intermediate (invertebrate) hosts was investigated,\r\n  and allied species were obtained from many different hosts.\r\n\r\n  Novy and MacNeal (1903) were the first to cultivate trypanosomes in\r\n  artificial media (blood-agar).\r\n\r\n  In 1910 Stephens and Fantham recorded the presence of another human\r\n  trypanosome, _T. rhodesiense_, from a case of sleeping sickness\r\n  in Rhodesia, where _G. palpalis_ was absent. Kinghorn has since\r\n  demonstrated that _T. rhodesiense_ is transmitted by _G. morsitans_.\r\n  Kinghorn and Yorke believe that big game (_e.g._, antelope) is the\r\n  reservoir of _T. rhodesiense_.\r\n\r\n  The output of literature on trypanosomiasis in men and animals is\r\n  enormous. To cope with it the Sleeping _Sickness Bureau Bulletin_\r\n  was founded in 1908, and it is now (since November 1912) continued\r\n  as a section of the _Tropical Diseases Bulletin_, wherein current\r\n  literature is reviewed.\r\n\r\nGENERAL.\r\n\r\nTrypanosomes occur in the blood of representatives of all the\r\nvertebrate classes. Often the trypanosomes occur so scantily in\r\nthe blood that they are overlooked on examination. A useful aid in\r\ndetecting the flagellates in such cases consists in the use of cultures\r\nof the blood of the host on artificial media. Stimulated by the\r\nmedium multiplication occurs, and hence the parasites are more easily\r\ndetected. [For the composition of such culture media see Appendix.]\r\n\r\nThere is a periodicity in the appearance of the trypanosomes in\r\nthe peripheral blood of the host, due to alternating phases of\r\nmultiplication and of rest on the part of the parasites. Such\r\nperiodicity has been established both by biological and enumerative\r\nmethods. Again, a seasonal variation has been observed in the\r\noccurrence of certain trypanosomes in the peripheral circulation of the\r\nhosts; for example, some trypanosomes (_e.g._, _T. noctuæ_ in birds)\r\nare found only in the summer in the blood, while in the winter they\r\noccur in the internal organs.\r\n\r\nRecent cultural researches have established that trypanosomes, _e.g._,\r\n_T. americanum_, may be present in very small numbers in hosts,\r\nsuch as cattle, which are quite unharmed by them, and in which the\r\npresence of these flagellates formerly was never suspected (“cryptic\r\ntrypanosomiasis.”) However, the majority of the trypanosomes occurring\r\nin domestic animals are usually deleterious or even lethal to their\r\nhosts. Many wild animals, such as various species of antelope, harbour\r\ntrypanosomes without being injured thereby. In such cases it is\r\nprobable that the vertebrate hosts have been so long parasitized in the\r\npast, that they have become tolerant and immune to the effects of the\r\nflagellates. Should such trypanosomes of wild animals be transmitted to\r\ndomesticated stock or man, they may re-acquire their initial virulence\r\nand become pathogenic to the new host. As a general statement, the\r\nnewer a parasite is to its host the greater is its virulence. For\r\nexample, _T. gambiense_, _T. rhodesiense_ and _T. brucei_ are innocuous\r\nto big game in Africa, but are pathogenic to man and domestic animals\r\nrespectively. Pathogenic trypanosomes appear to have a wider range\r\nof hosts, that is, to be less limited to one specific host than\r\nnon-pathogenic forms. Thus, _T. rhodesiense_ is pathogenic to man and\r\nall laboratory animals, while it is non-pathogenic to antelopes and\r\ntheir kind.\r\n\r\n_Morphology._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--_Trypanosoma brucei_ in division. _n_,\r\nnucleus; _bl_, blepharoplast; _fl_, flagellum. × 2,000. (After Laveran\r\nand Mesnil.)]\r\n\r\nThe general structure of the various trypanosomes shows much\r\nuniformity, though variations in size and shape occur. Typically the\r\nbody is elongate and sinuous. The flagellar end tapers gradually to a\r\npoint, the aflagellar extremity usually being rounded or more blunt.\r\nIn some trypanosomes there is much diversity in size, the organisms\r\nvarying from long, slender forms to short, stumpy ones; in other\r\nspecies relative constancy of size is maintained. The former are known\r\nas polymorphic trypanosomes, the latter as monomorphic forms.\r\n\r\nTwo nuclei are present. The main or principal nucleus, sometimes termed\r\nthe trophic nucleus, is often situated towards the centre of the body;\r\nit is frequently of the vesicular type, containing a karyosome. The\r\nblepharoplast or kinetic nucleus is posterior to the nucleus, and\r\nusually is rod-like. The flagellum arises close to the blepharoplast,\r\nand forms an edge to the undulating membrane. It may or may not\r\nextend beyond the limits of the undulating membrane. If it does so,\r\nthe unattached part is known as the free flagellum. Sometimes a small\r\ngranule is found at the origin of the flagellum. This is the basal\r\ngranule, and is considered by some to function as the centriole of the\r\nkinetic nucleus.\r\n\r\nThe undulating membrane is a lateral extension of the ectoplasm or\r\nperiplast, and is the main agent in locomotion. It is edged by the\r\nflagellum, which forms a deeply stainable border to it. Within the\r\nmembrane substance, often arranged parallel with its edge, are a number\r\nof fine contractile elements, the myonemes. These contractile elements\r\nmay also occur on the body of the trypanosome. They are easily seen in\r\nsome large trypanosomes, but are difficult of demonstration in others,\r\nowing to their great fineness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.--_Trypanosoma lewisi_. Multiplication rosettes.\r\n× 1,000. (After Laveran and Mesnil.)]\r\n\r\nMultiplication of trypanosomes in the blood is brought about by binary\r\nlongitudinal fission (fig. 26). Division is initiated by that of the\r\nblepharoplast and nucleus. The division may be equal or subequal,\r\nwhereby differences in size of individuals partly arise. Multiple\r\ndivision by repeated binary fission, without complete separation of the\r\ndaughter forms, is known in some trypanosomes (_e.g._, _T. lewisi_),\r\nand rosettes of parasites thereby are produced (fig. 27).\r\n\r\nThe classification of trypanosomes is very difficult. Laveran\r\n(1911)[54] has suggested the examination of the relative length\r\nof the flagellum as a diagnostic character, and so arranged these\r\nflagellates in mammals in three groups. The first group included those\r\ntrypanosomes always having part of the flagellum free (_e.g._, _T.\r\nevansi_, _T. vivax_); the second group comprised forms without a part\r\nof the flagellum free (_e.g._, _T. congolense_), while the third group\r\nincluded forms some members of which have free flagella, while others\r\nhave not (_e.g._, _T. gambiense_). Bruce[55] (1914) and Yorke and\r\nBlacklock[56] (1914) have also devised classifications.\r\n\r\n[54] _Ann. Inst. Pasteur_, xxv, p. 497.\r\n\r\n[55] _Trans. Soc. Trop. Med. & Hyg._, viii, p. 1.\r\n\r\n[56] _Annals Trop. Med. and Parasitol._, viii, p. 1.\r\n\r\nResting stages of some trypanosomes have been found in the internal\r\norgans of their vertebrate hosts. The formation of these oval,\r\nLeishmania-like bodies will be noted in individual cases later. Similar\r\nsmall oval bodies form an important phase in the life-history of _T.\r\ncruzi_, which multiplies normally by multiple fission or schizogony\r\ninto these oval, daughter elements, and not by binary longitudinal\r\nfission in the circulating blood.\r\n\r\nPolymorphism in trypanosomes (_e.g._, _T. gambiense_, _T. rhodesiense_)\r\nis now interpreted as a phenomenon resulting from growth and\r\ndivision.[57] Long, thin forms are those about to divide. Fully mature\r\nforms are shorter and broader. Various intermediate types occur and\r\nrepresent growth forms. Formerly, polymorphism was interpreted in terms\r\nof sex, thin forms being regarded as males, broad forms as females,\r\nwhile the intermediate types were termed indifferent. Conjugation\r\nwas not observed, and there is no evidence in support of the sexual\r\ninterpretation.\r\n\r\n[57] Robertson (1912), _Proc. Roy. Soc._, B, lxxxv, p. 527.\r\n\r\nThe transmission of trypanosomes from one vertebrate host to another is\r\nusually accomplished by the intermediation of some biting arthropod in\r\nthe case of terrestrial animals, while leeches are usually considered\r\nto act as transmitters in the case of the trypanosomes occurring\r\nin aquatic animals. Developmental phases of the life-histories of\r\ntrypanosomes occur in the invertebrate transmitters, and will be\r\nconsidered in individual cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Trypanosoma gambiense*, Dutton, 1902.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Trypanosoma hominis_, Manson, 1903. _Trypanosoma nepveui_,\r\n  Sambon, 1903. _Trypanosoma castellanii_, Kruse, 1903. _Trypanosoma\r\n  ugandense_, Castellani, 1903. _Trypanosoma fordii_, Maxwell Adams.\r\n\r\nIn vertebrate blood _Trypanosoma gambiense_ is polymorphic, for long,\r\nthin forms may be seen in contrast with short, stumpy forms, as well\r\nas intermediate forms (fig. 29, _a_--_c_). This polymorphism has been\r\ninterpreted in terms of sex, especially by German investigators,\r\nfollowing Schaudinn (see above). However, there is no evidence of\r\nconjugation, and the polymorphic forms are more easily interpreted in\r\nterms of growth and division, for the long thin forms are potential\r\ndividing organisms, and the stumpy or short parasites, with little or\r\nno free flagellum, are the adult individuals.\r\n\r\n_Morphology of T. gambiense in the Circulating Blood._\r\n\r\n_T. gambiense_ varies from 13 µ to 36 µ in length, its average length\r\nbeing 24·8 µ, as was determined in 1913 by exact biometrical methods\r\nby Stephens and Fantham.[58] Three forms of parasite occur. According\r\nto Miss Robertson,[59] the relatively short forms from 13 µ to 21 µ\r\nlong may be regarded as the mature or “adult” type of parasite in\r\nthe blood. They carry on the cycle in the vertebrate. From them\r\nintermediate forms, which are longer than the “adult” but at first have\r\nthe same breadth, arise by growth. They possess a free flagellum. The\r\nintermediate forms grow into long individuals, which are those about to\r\ndivide. The products of division give rise, directly or indirectly, to\r\nthe adult forms.\r\n\r\n[58] _Annals Trop. Med. and Parasitol._, vii, p. 27.\r\n\r\n[59] _Phil. Trans._, B (1913), cciii, pp. 161–184.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--_Trypanosoma gambiense_. × 1,700. (After\r\nDutton.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--_Trypanosoma gambiense_. Development in\r\nvertebrate host. _a_, long, slender, _b_, intermediate and _c_, short,\r\nstumpy forms, found in the blood; _d_, _e_, _f_, non-flagellate, latent\r\nforms from internal organs. × 2,000. (Original. From preparations by\r\nFantham.)]\r\n\r\nThe organism has an elongate body with an anterior or flagellar end\r\nand a blunter posterior or non-flagellar end. The protoplasm is finely\r\ngranular, large inclusions being rare. The central nucleus is oval\r\nand large, often containing most of its chromatin concentrated as a\r\nkaryosome, with small granules only scattered near or on the fine\r\nnuclear membrane. The blepharoplast is either rounded or rod-shaped.\r\nThe undulating membrane is thrown into folds and is bordered by the\r\nflagellum. A small basal granule may be present near, or at the actual\r\norigin of the flagellum.\r\n\r\n_Multiplication_ in the vertebrate is brought about by longitudinal\r\ndivision. According to the recent account of division by Miss\r\nRobertson, the blepharoplast doubles, then the flagellum splits for\r\nthe greater part of its length, and the daughter flagella separate,\r\none being shorter than the parent flagellum. The nucleus often shows\r\ntwo well marked dark granules on the membrane at opposite poles, and\r\nthese appear to act as centrosomes. Nuclear constriction occurs and\r\nthe halves gradually separate. Finally the two daughter organisms\r\nbecome free, the aflagellar end splitting last. The products of\r\ndivision may be equal or unequal. Repeated division goes on in the\r\ngeneral circulation until the blood swarms with parasites. Then the\r\ntrypanosomes gradually disappear, and a period occurs when it is\r\npractically impossible to demonstrate the parasite in the blood.\r\nAt such a period, trypanosomes can be obtained by puncture of the\r\nenlarged lymphatic glands or of the spinal canal, or can be found in\r\nthe internal organs, more particularly in the spleen, lungs, liver and\r\nbone-marrow. In the latter organs, latent bodies are produced (fig. 29,\r\n_d_--_f_) which are capable of again becoming flagellates and entering\r\nthe general circulation. Their formation was described by Fantham\r\n(1911).[60] The parasite contracts, the blepharoplast migrates towards\r\nthe nucleus, a very thin coat differentiates around the two nuclei\r\nand a certain amount of cytoplasm, and the parts exterior to the coat\r\ndisintegrate, leaving a small, oval body behind. Fuller details are\r\ngiven in connection with _T. rhodesiense_. Laveran (1911)[61] considers\r\nthat latent bodies are “involution” forms, but acknowledges that they\r\ncan flagellate and become infective in fresh blood.\r\n\r\n[60] _Proc. Roy. Soc._, B, lxxxiii, p. 212.\r\n\r\n[61] _C. R. Acad. Sci._, 153, p. 649.\r\n\r\nNo multiplication of the trypanosomes within the cells of the lung,\r\nliver or spleen of infected monkeys was found by Miss Robertson in her\r\nrecent researches.\r\n\r\nThere appear to be negative periods in infected monkeys, since,\r\nalthough trypanosomes may occur in their blood at such times, they are\r\nnot infective to _Glossina_.\r\n\r\n_Development in Glossina palpalis._--The principal accounts are\r\nthose by Sir D. Bruce and his colleagues (1911),[62] and by Miss\r\nRobertson[63] (1912), whose results will be followed. According to the\r\nlatter investigator _T. gambiense_ never enters the body cells of the\r\nfly (_G. palpalis_), nor does it penetrate the gut wall into the body\r\ncavity. Practically no crithidial stage occurs in the fly’s main gut,\r\nbut a trypanosome facies is retained therein.\r\n\r\n[62] _Proc. Roy. Soc._, B, lxxxiii, p. 513.\r\n\r\n[63] _Proc. Roy. Soc._, B, lxxxvi, p. 66.\r\n\r\nAfter the trypanosomes are ingested by the fly during a meal of\r\ninfected blood, sooner or later multiplication occurs. This development\r\nusually begins in the middle or posterior part of the mid gut, and\r\ntrypanosomes of varying sizes are produced. After the tenth or twelfth\r\nday, many long, slender trypanosomes (fig. 30, _a_) are found, which\r\ngradually move forwards into the proventriculus. Such long, slender\r\nforms represent the limit of development in the lumen of the main gut.\r\nThe proventricular type, developed about the eighth to the eighteenth\r\nor twentieth day, is not infective; it may occur in the crop, but is\r\nnot to be found permanently there. Between the tenth and the fifteenth\r\ndays multinucleate forms of trypanosomes are found, and may be styled\r\nmultiple forms (fig. 30, _b_). Some of these latter may be degenerative.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--_Trypanosoma gambiense_. Development in the\r\nfly, _Glossina palpalis_. _a_, slender, proventricular form; _b_,\r\nmultinucleate form; _c_, _d_, crithidial forms; _e_, infective type of\r\ntrypanosome found in salivary gland. × 2,500. (After Robertson.)]\r\n\r\n_Invasion of the Salivary Glands of the Fly._--Long, slender\r\ntrypanosomes from the proventriculus pass forward into the hypopharynx.\r\nThey then pass back along the salivary ducts, about sixteen to thirty\r\ndays after the fly’s feed. The trypanosomes reach the salivary glands\r\nas long, slender forms. In the glands they become shorter and broader,\r\nattach themselves to the surrounding structures, and assume the\r\ncrithidial facies (fig. 30, _c_, _d_). As crithidial forms they remain\r\nattached to the wall and multiply in the glands. These crithidial\r\nstages differentiate into the short, broad trypanosome forms, capable\r\nof swimming freely (fig. 30, _e_).\r\n\r\nMiss Robertson considers the development in the main gut to be\r\nindifferent multiplication, and that salivary fluid seems necessary to\r\nstimulate trypanosomes to the apparently essential reversion to the\r\ncrithidial type. The second development in the salivary gland is the\r\nessential feature. The short, stumpy forms of trypanosomes (fig. 30,\r\n_e_) finally produced in the salivary glands are alone infective. No\r\nconjugation of trypanosomes occurs in the fly. Only about 5 per cent.\r\nof captive tsetse flies fed on trypanosome-infected blood become\r\ninfective, but they probably remain infective for the rest of their\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nJ. G. Thomson and Sinton (1912)[64] have obtained in cultures the\r\nvarious trypanosome forms of _T. gambiense_ seen in the fly’s main gut.\r\n\r\n[64] _Annals Trop. Med. and Parasitol._, vi, p. 331.\r\n\r\nDuke (1912)[65] found _T. gambiense_ in a species of antelope, the\r\nsitutunga (_Tragelaphus spekei_), on Damba Island in Victoria Nyanza.\r\nWild _G. palpalis_ could be infected therefrom. The antelope may then\r\nact as a sleeping sickness reservoir in that district, but men are\r\napparently the chief reservoir.\r\n\r\n[65] _Proc. Roy. Soc._, B, lxxxv, pp. 156, 483.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Trypanosoma nigeriense*, Macfie, 1913.[66]\r\n\r\nMacfie has recently (August, 1913) described a human trypanosome\r\nfrom the Eket district of Southern Nigeria. It is common in young\r\npeople. The disease produced does not seem to be of a virulent type\r\nin Nigeria, and does not occur in epidemic form. In the early stages\r\nthe glands of the neck are enlarged. In the later stages--cases of\r\nwhich are rarer--lethargy appears. The parasite is a polymorphic\r\ntrypanosome, morphologically almost indistinguishable from _T.\r\ngambiense_, though it may be slightly shorter. Macfie recorded the\r\noccurrence in his preparations of a few trypanosomes appearing to have\r\na flagellum free during their whole length. Some of the parasites,\r\nas seen in a sub-inoculated guinea-pig, are very small (8 µ long).\r\nOther trypanosomes have their nuclei displaced somewhat anteriorly.\r\nThis parasite may only be a variety of _T. gambiense_. The parasite is\r\nperhaps spread by _Glossina tachinoides_.\r\n\r\n[66] _Annals Trop. Med. and Parasitol._, vii, p. 339; viii, p. 379.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Trypanosoma rhodesiense*, Stephens and Fantham, 1910.\r\n\r\nThe parasite was found in the blood of a young Englishman who had\r\ncontracted sleeping sickness in the Luangwa Valley, North-eastern\r\nRhodesia, in the autumn of 1909. The patient had never been in an area\r\ninfested with _Glossina palpalis_.\r\n\r\n(1) _Morphology._--The morphology of the parasite in man and\r\nsub-inoculated rats was studied by Stephens and Fantham in 1910.[67]\r\nThey pointed out a morphological peculiarity in the presence of certain\r\ntrypanosomes with posterior nuclei in sub-inoculated animals, that is,\r\nparasites in which the nucleus (trophonucleus) was situated towards\r\nthe posterior or aflagellar end, close up to or even beyond the\r\nblepharoplast or kinetic nucleus (fig. 31, _4_, _5_). When the nucleus\r\nwas beside the blepharoplast, the former was seen to be kidney-shaped\r\n(fig. 31, _4_). The posterior nuclear forms were of the stout and\r\nstumpy variety, and about 6 per cent. of the stumpy forms were found to\r\nhave their nuclei displaced from the centre. The anterior or flagellar\r\nend of these trypanosomes often contained chromatoid granules. _T.\r\nrhodesiense_ varies in length from 12 µ to 39 µ[68]; short stumpy forms\r\nvary from 13 µ to 21 µ, intermediate forms from 21 µ to 24 µ, and long,\r\nslender forms from 25 µ onwards. The average length is 24·1 µ.\r\n\r\n[67] _Proc. Roy. Soc._, B, lxxxiii, p. 28.\r\n\r\n[68] Stephens and Fantham (1912–13), _Proc. Roy. Soc._, B, lxxxv,\r\np. 223, and _Annals Trop.

(After Stephens and Fantham.)]\r\n\r\nCertain regular periods occur in the course of the trypanosomiasis when\r\nfew or no flagellate trypanosomes are found in the peripheral blood\r\nof the patient or of the sub-inoculated animal. These periods can be\r\nexplained in terms of morphology, for the trypanosomes are capable of\r\nassuming a non-flagellate form in the internal organs of the host,\r\nparticularly in the lungs and in the spleen. Such forms are known as\r\n“latent” or “resting” forms. The term “latent body” was first used\r\nby Moore and Breinl in 1907[69] in connection with _T. gambiense_.\r\nFantham[70] (1911) has described the process of formation of latent\r\nfrom motile forms and the reconversion of the latent bodies into\r\nactive flagellates. Fresh preparations of splenic blood or lung blood\r\ncontaining trypanosomes were made. A trypanosome gradually withdrew or\r\ncast off its flagellum, concentrated its cytoplasm, and became more or\r\nless elongate oval. Nucleus and blepharoplast approached one another\r\nand came to lie more or less side by side. Then an opaque line often\r\nmade its appearance around the nuclear area and differentiated as a\r\nslight envelope or covering, the cytoplasm external to this merely\r\ndegenerating. The small, oval, refractile body (fig. 29, _d_--_f_) thus\r\nformed was a non-flagellate latent body, 2 µ to 4 µ in diameter, like\r\n_Leishmania_ or the non-flagellate, multiplicative forms of _T. cruzi_\r\n(fig. 34), and remains temporarily inactive in the internal organs of\r\nthe host. After this period of inactivity, the non-flagellate body,\r\nrecuperated by its rest, begins to elongate again. The nuclei separate.\r\nFrom a small vacuole-like portion the flagellum differentiates and\r\nforces out the ectoplasm, which assumes the form of the undulating\r\nmembrane with its flagellar border. Subsequent growth results in\r\nthe production of the typical trypanosome form, which re-enters the\r\ncirculating blood and multiplies by longitudinal binary fission.\r\nDivision of the parasite prior to the formation of a latent body may\r\noccur and division of the latent forms themselves is known, though\r\nless common. Consequently latent bodies, like the flagellate forms\r\nthemselves, show diversity in size. The blepharoplast of the latent\r\nbodies is sometimes less well marked than in _Leishmania_ (see fig. 29,\r\n_d_-_f_). Laveran’s views on these bodies have already been given on\r\np. 74.\r\n\r\n[69] _Annals Trop. Med. and Parasitol._, i, p. 441.\r\n\r\n[70] _Proc. Roy. Soc._, B, lxxxiii, p. 212.\r\n\r\n(2) _Animal Reactions._--The posterior nuclear trypanosomes were found\r\nin all sub-inoculated animals, such as rats, guinea-pigs, dogs, mice,\r\nMacacus, rabbits and horses, but were not seen in the human patient,\r\nas few trypanosomes occurred in his peripheral blood. R. Ross and D.\r\nThomson[71] found a periodic, cyclical variation in the number of the\r\nparasites in the patient’s blood from day to day, the cyclical period\r\nbeing about a week (fig. 32). Fantham and J. G. Thomson[72] (1911)\r\nfound a similar periodic, cyclical variation in the trypanosomes\r\nin the blood of sub-inoculated rats, guinea-pigs and rabbits. On\r\ncounting the parasites in the blood of similar animals inoculated\r\nwith _T. gambiense_, they established, by enumerative methods, that\r\n_T. rhodesiense_ was more virulent than _T. gambiense_, while Yorke\r\nalso showed this marked virulence of _T. rhodesiense_ in practically\r\nall laboratory animals. In other words the duration of infection in\r\nthe case of _T. rhodesiense_ was shorter. It was also found that _T.\r\nrhodesiense_ was resistant to atoxyl. The patient, from whom the\r\noriginal strain was obtained, died about nine months after the probable\r\ndate of infection. Some patients infected with _T. rhodesiense_ have\r\ndied in an even shorter period, such as four or five months.\r\n\r\n[71] _Proc. Roy. Soc._, B, lxxxii, p. 411.\r\n\r\n[72] _Annals Trop. Med. and Parasitol._, iv, p. 417.\r\n\r\nIn sheep and goats _T. rhodesiense_ causes an acute disease, marked by\r\nhigh fever, œdema of the face, and keratitis, as shown by Bevan and\r\nothers, death resulting after a relatively short period. _T. gambiense_\r\ngives rise, in these animals, to no symptoms except fever, which may be\r\noverlooked. _T. rhodesiense_ produces keratitis in dogs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--Chart showing daily counts of number of\r\ntrypanosomes per cubic millimetre of peripheral blood from a case of\r\nRhodesian sleeping sickness. (After R. Ross and D. Thomson.)]\r\n\r\nStannus and Yorke (1911) observed _T. rhodesiense_ in animals\r\ninoculated from a case of sleeping sickness in Nyasaland. Sir D. Bruce\r\nand his colleagues[73] have shown (1912) that _T. rhodesiense_ is the\r\nparasite usually found in man and in animals sub-inoculated from cases\r\nof sleeping sickness in Nyasaland. It has since been found in German\r\nEast Africa and Portuguese East Africa, while Ellacombe has described a\r\ncase from North-western Rhodesia.\r\n\r\n[73] _Proc. Roy. Soc._, B, lxxxv, p. 423.\r\n\r\n(3) _Serum Reactions._--Interesting experiments on this subject were\r\nperformed during 1911 and 1912 by various French investigators.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Action of Immune Serum_ (Mesnil and Ringenbach)[74]: (1) A\r\ngoat was infected with _T. rhodesiense_. Twenty-two days later its\r\nserum mixed with _T. rhodesiense_ was injected into a mouse. Result:\r\nProtection. (2) The serum mixed with _T. gambiense_ was injected into a\r\nmouse. Result: Infection.\r\n\r\n[74] _C.R. Soc. Biol._, lxxii, p. 58.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Action of Baboon Serum._--Contrary to _T. gambiense_, _T.\r\nrhodesiense_ is very susceptible to human and baboon sera. Mesnil and\r\nRingenbach[75] showed that a dose of 1 c.c. of baboon (_Papio anubis_)\r\nserum cured mice infected with _T. rhodesiense_. In the same dose it\r\nacted very feebly on _T. gambiense_.\r\n\r\n[75] _C.R. Acad. Sci._, 153, p. 1,097.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Action of Human Serum._--_1 c.c._ of human serum cured _T.\r\nrhodesiense_ mice in three out of four cases; on _T. gambiense_ mice\r\nthere was no appreciable effect.\r\n\r\nLaveran and Nattan-Larrier[76] have shown the same, namely, that human\r\nsera act on _T. rhodesiense_, but are quite without action on _T.\r\ngambiense_.\r\n\r\n[76] _C.R. Acad. Sci._, 154, p. 18.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Trypanolytic Reactions._--Mesnil and Ringenbach[77] have also\r\nshown that the sera of animals (man, monkey and guinea-pig) infected\r\nwith _T. gambiense_ are trypanolytic for the homologous trypanosome,\r\nthat is, _T. gambiense_, but have no action on the heterologous\r\ntrypanosome, that is, _T. rhodesiense_.\r\n\r\n[77] _C.R. Soc. Biol._, lxxi, p. 609.\r\n\r\n(4) _Cross Immunity Experiments._--(_a_) Mesnil and Ringenbach[78]\r\nimmunized a monkey (_Macacus rhesus_) against _T. gambiense_. It\r\nwas inoculated with _T. rhodesiense_ on June 7, 1911; on June 27\r\ntrypanosomes appeared, the infection being slight; on July 4 it died. A\r\ncontrol died in ten and a half days.\r\n\r\n[78] _C.R. Soc. Biol._, lxxi, p. 271.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Laveran[79] immunized a goat and mice against _T. gambiense_.\r\nWhen they had acquired a solid immunity, they were inoculated with _T.\r\nrhodesiense_. They became infected like the controls.\r\n\r\n[79] _Bull. Soc. Path. Exot._, v, pp. 26, 241.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Laveran and Nattan-Larrier[80] immunized a ram against _T.\r\nbrucei_, it subsequently became infected with _T. rhodesiense_.\r\n\r\n[80] _C.R. Acad. Sci._, 154, p. 18.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Laveran[81] immunized a ram and a sheep against different strains\r\nof T_. brucei_. Inoculated with _T. rhodesiense_ they both acquired\r\nacute infections and died. Conclusion: _T. rhodesiense_ is not _T.\r\nbrucei_.\r\n\r\n[81] _Bull. Soc. Path. Exot._, v, p. 101.\r\n\r\nWhen the converse set of experiments is tried, namely, immunizing\r\nan animal against _T. rhodesiense_, and then inoculating with _T.\r\ngambiense_, the difficulty immediately arises that it is impossible\r\nto immunize an animal against _T. rhodesiense_, owing to its\r\nvirulence. But a partial and transitory immunity to _T. rhodesiense_\r\ncan be obtained by treating the infected animal with drugs, such as\r\narsenophenylglycin. The results, so far as they go, seem to show that\r\nan animal immunized against _T. rhodesiense_ is immune not only to\r\n_T. rhodesiense_, but also to _T. gambiense_, a fact which, according\r\nto Mesnil and Léger, does not invalidate the specificity of _T.\r\nrhodesiense_, but tends to show that the two trypanosomes are closely\r\nrelated.\r\n\r\n(5) _Mode of Transmission and Reservoir._--Kinghorn has shown that\r\n_T. rhodesiense_ is transmitted by _Glossina morsitans_ in which it\r\nundergoes development. Kinghorn and Yorke[82] found that about 16 per\r\ncent. of the wild game examined in Northern Rhodesia was naturally\r\ninfected with _T. rhodesiense_. The wild game examined included\r\nwaterbuck, hartebeest, mpala, bushbuck and warthogs. One native dog\r\nnear the Nyasaland border was found infected, but not domestic stock.\r\nTaute doubts whether _T. rhodesiense_ really occurs in wild game.\r\nApproximately 3·5 per cent. of the tsetse flies fed on infected animals\r\nmay become permanently infected with _T. rhodesiense_, and capable of\r\ninfecting clean animals. Furthermore, a tsetse fly when once infective\r\nprobably remains infective for the rest of its life.\r\n\r\n[82] _Annals Trop. Med. and Parasitol._, vii, p. 183.\r\n\r\nKinghorn and Yorke, however, have shown that climatic conditions,\r\nnamely, those of temperature, also affect the infectivity of the tsetse\r\nfly, as the ratio of flies capable of transmitting _T. rhodesiense_\r\nto those incapable of transmitting the virus is 1 : 534 in hot valley\r\ndistricts (_e.g._, Nawalia, Luangwa Valley, temperature 75° to 85° F.),\r\nwhile on elevated plateaux (_e.g._, Ngoa, on the Congo-Zambesi\r\nwatershed, temperature 60° to 70° F.) the ratio falls to 1 : 1312.\r\n\r\nMechanical transmission by the tsetse fly does not occur, if a period\r\nof twenty-four hours has elapsed since the infecting meal.\r\n\r\n_Developmental Cycle in the Fly._--The period which elapses between the\r\ninfecting feed of the flies and the date on which they become infective\r\nvaries from eleven to twenty-five days in the Luangwa Valley, according\r\nto Kinghorn and Yorke. Attempts carried out at laboratory temperature\r\non the Congo-Zambesi plateau, during the cold season, to transmit _T.\r\nrhodesiense_ by means of _G. morsitans_ were always unsuccessful. The\r\ndevelopmental cycle of the trypanosome in the fly is influenced by\r\nthe temperature to which the flies are subjected (as stated above).\r\nThe first portion of the developmental cycle proceeds at the lower\r\ntemperatures (60° to 70° F.), but higher temperatures are necessary\r\nfor the completion of the development of the trypanosome. Kinghorn\r\nand Yorke found that the trypanosomes may persist in the fly, at an\r\nincomplete stage of their development, for at least sixty days when the\r\nclimatic conditions were unfavourable.\r\n\r\nThe first portion of the developmental cycle of the trypanosome takes\r\nplace in the gut of the fly. Invasion of the salivary glands of the\r\ntsetse is secondary to that of the intestine, but is necessary for\r\nthe infectivity of the fly. A relatively high mean temperature, 75°\r\nto 85° F., is essential for the passage of the trypanosomes into the\r\nsalivary glands and the completion of their development therein.\r\n\r\nKinghorn and Yorke[83] state that the predominant type of trypanosome\r\nin the intestine of infected _G. morsitans_ was a large broad form,\r\nquite different from that which is most common in the salivary glands.\r\nThe trypanosome in the glands resembles the short form seen in the\r\nblood of the vertebrate host. The authors quoted state that both the\r\nintestinal and salivary gland forms of infective _G. morsitans_ are\r\nvirulent when inoculated into healthy animals.\r\n\r\n[83] _Annals Trop. Med. and Parasitol._, vii, p. 281.\r\n\r\nBruce and colleagues[84] have quite recently (June, 1914) published\r\nan account of their investigations of _T. rhodesiense_ in _G.\r\nmorsitans_ in Nyasaland. (Incidentally it may be remarked that Bruce\r\nconsiders _T. rhodesiense_ to be identical with a polymorphic strain\r\nof _T. brucei_--see pp. 83, 94). The development of _T. rhodesiense_\r\ntakes place in the alimentary canal and salivary glands, not in the\r\nproboscis, of the tsetse fly. In feeding experiments with laboratory\r\nbred flies, as well as with a few wild flies, fed on infected dogs\r\nor monkeys, only 8 per cent. of the flies were found to be infected\r\non dissection. Of such infected flies, however, only some allow of\r\nthe complete development of the trypanosomes within them, in other\r\nwords only about 1 per cent of the flies become _infective_. The\r\nlength of time which elapses before a fly becomes infective varies\r\nfrom fourteen to thirty-one days, averaging twenty-three days, when\r\nkept at 84° F. (29° C.). The dominant intestinal type of flagellate\r\nin the fly is that seen in the proventriculus, which contains many\r\nlong, slender trypanosomes. These proventricular forms find their\r\nway to the salivary glands, wherein crithidial and encysted forms\r\nare seen. They change into “blood forms,” which are short, stumpy\r\ntrypanosomes and are infective. “The infective type of trypanosome in\r\nthe salivary glands--corresponding to the final stage of the cycle of\r\ndevelopment--is similar to the short and stumpy form found in the blood\r\nof the vertebrate host.” The cycle is thus very similar to that of _T.\r\ngambiense_ in _G. palpalis_ (fig. 30).\r\n\r\n[84] _Proc. Roy. Soc._, B, lxxxvii, p. 516.\r\n\r\nCULTURE.--J. G. Thomson (1912),[85] and subsequently Thomson and\r\nSinton, succeeded in cultivating _T. rhodesiense_ in a modified\r\nNovy-MacNeal medium. The development obtained resembled that of the\r\ntrypanosome in the intestine of _Glossina_.\r\n\r\n[85] _Annals Trop. Med. and Parasitol._, vi, pp. 103, 331.\r\n\r\nGENERAL NOTE ON TRYPANOSOMES WITH POSTERIOR NUCLEI.\r\n\r\nPosteriorly placed nuclei have been found to occur not only in _T.\r\nrhodesiense_ by Stephens and Fantham (1910), but also in _T. pecaudi_\r\nby Wenyon (1912), in _T. brucei_ by Blacklock (1912), and in _T.\r\nequiperdum_ by Yorke and Blacklock (1912).\r\n\r\nRecently Stephens and Blacklock (1913)[86] have shown that two\r\ntrypanosomes, different morphologically, have been confused under the\r\nname _T. brucei_. One of these is polymorphic (_i.e._, it exhibits long\r\nand slender as well as short and stumpy forms) and came from Uganda,\r\nwhile the other is monomorphic and is the original Zululand strain\r\ndescribed by Bruce from cattle suffering from “nagana.” Bruce (1914)\r\nconsiders that morphological change has occurred in _T. brucei_ in its\r\npassage through laboratory animals, and thus explains the diversity of\r\nviews. The posterior nuclear forms described by Blacklock occurred in\r\nthe Uganda strain of _T. brucei_. (See p. 95.) Similarly, a posterior\r\nnuclear form, _T. equi_, has been separated from _T. equiperdum_. (See\r\np. 98.)\r\n\r\n[86] _Proc. Roy. Soc._, B, lxxxvi, p. 187.\r\n\r\nAgain, Bruce and his colleagues on the Royal Society Commission\r\ninvestigating sleeping sickness in Nyasaland, have stated (April,\r\n1913) that “evidence is accumulating that _T. rhodesiense_ and _T.\r\nbrucei_ (Plimmer and Bradford) are identical.” The exact identity of\r\ntrypanosomes showing posterior nuclei is, then, far from settled,\r\nalthough Laveran by cross immunity tests has declared that _T. brucei_\r\nis distinct from _T. rhodesiense_. No one has yet seen posterior nuclei\r\nin _T. gambiense_.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Trypanosoma cruzi*, Chagas, 1909.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Schizotrypanum cruzi_, Chagas, 1909.\r\n\r\nThe trypanosome was discovered by Chagas[87] in the intestine of the\r\nbug, _Triatoma_ (_Conorhinus_) _megista_, in Brazil, and then in the\r\nblood of a small monkey bitten by the bug. A little later it was found\r\nin the blood of a child, aged two years, suffering from irregular\r\nfever, extreme anæmia and enlarged glands in the State of Minas Geraes,\r\nBrazil. Chagas found that he was able to infect many of the usual\r\nlaboratory animals with the trypanosome, by allowing the bug to bite\r\nthem. He was also able to culture the parasite on blood agar.\r\n\r\n[87] _Mem. Inst. Oswaldo Cruz._, i, p. 159.\r\n\r\nChagas found the Reduviid bug, _Triatoma megista_, in the houses of the\r\npoorer inhabitants of the Brazilian mining State, and that it attacked\r\nthe people, more especially the children, at night, biting the face.\r\nOn this account the insect is called “barbeiro” by the inhabitants.\r\nThe bite is somewhat painful. The disease has since been found in other\r\nparts of Brazil, _e.g._, Matta de São João in Bahia province, Goyaz,\r\nMatto Grosso and São Paulo provinces, as well as in Minas Geraes.\r\n\r\n_Morphology._--The trypanosome has a large blepharoplast or kinetic\r\nnucleus. It is stated to occur both free and in the red blood\r\ncorpuscles in the peripheral blood. It is about 20 µ long, on an\r\naverage.\r\n\r\nTwo forms of the parasite (fig. 33, _6_, _7_) are described in the\r\nhuman blood. In one free form there is a large egg-shaped blepharoplast\r\nand the posterior (aflagellar) end of the parasite is drawn out. The\r\nblepharoplast (kinetic nucleus) may have a chromatin appendage. The\r\nnucleus is oval or band-like, containing a karyosome. The flagellum,\r\nstarting close to the blepharoplast or its appendage, has a free\r\nportion of variable length. The other free form in the blood has a more\r\nor less round, terminal blepharoplast, smaller than in the first form,\r\nwithout a chromatin appendage as a rule. The body of this second form\r\nis decidedly broader than that of the first mentioned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.--_Trypanosoma cruzi_. Schizogony. _1_,\r\nmerozoite in red blood corpuscle; _2_, parasite totally enclosed in\r\nred cell, no flagellum or undulating membrane; _3_-_5_, parasites\r\npartially enclosed in red cell; _6_, _7_, parasites in human blood;\r\n_8_-_11_, parasites in lungs of the monkey, _Callithrix_; _12_, _13_,\r\ninitial forms of schizogony; _14_, _15_, schizogony in the lungs of\r\n_Callithrix_. (After Chagas.)]\r\n\r\nThe dimorphism has been interpreted sexually, the first mentioned forms\r\nbeing termed males, the second ones females. The correctness of this\r\ninterpretation is very doubtful.\r\n\r\nNo sign of longitudinal division was ever seen in the peripheral\r\nblood or in the internal organs. The “endocorpuscular” forms may be\r\ncompletely or partially enclosed in the red cell or only attached\r\nthereto (fig. 33, _1_-_5_). At the beginning of infection the\r\nendocorpuscular forms are the more numerous. Some authorities, however,\r\ndoubt these stages.\r\n\r\n_Life-history in the Vertebrate Host._--Chagas found fluctuations in\r\nthe number of the parasites in the peripheral blood. He believes the\r\nincrease of the parasites to be periodic.\r\n\r\nThe investigations of Chagas and of Hartmann have revealed two types\r\nof multiplication which take place in the internal organs of the\r\nvertebrate host.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The first type--which possibly belongs to another organism,\r\n_Pneumocystis carinii_, see p. 90--occurs in the capillaries of the\r\nlungs. The flagellate parasite entering the lung capillaries loses\r\nits flagellum and undulating membrane. Its body becomes curved, and\r\nthe two ends fuse, and so an oval mass is formed (fig. 33, _8_-_11_).\r\nIn some cases the blepharoplast disappears, in other cases it blends\r\nor fuses with the nucleus. The nucleus of the rounded parasite then\r\ndivides into eight by successive divisions (fig. 33, _12_-_15_). Next\r\nthe body, which is surrounded by its own periplast, also divides,\r\ngiving rise to eight tiny daughter individuals or merozoites (fig. 33,\r\n_15_). The merozoites lie inside the periplast, which acts as a sort of\r\n“cyst wall.” The merozoites are said to exhibit dimorphism, and Chagas\r\nhas interpreted the dimorphism in terms of sex. The daughter forms,\r\nproduced by the parent trypanosomes which kept their blepharoplasts,\r\nthemselves have blepharoplasts as well as nuclei, and have been\r\ntermed “males” or “microgametes.” The merozoites, arising from parent\r\ntrypanosomes which lost their blepharoplasts, have themselves only\r\nnuclei, and have been called “females” or “macrogametes.” In the case\r\nof the so-called “female” forms the single nucleus divides into two\r\nunequal parts, of which the smaller becomes the blepharoplast, and\r\na flagellum is formed later. The so-called “males” possess early a\r\nrudiment of a flagellum. Both kinds of merozoites escape from the\r\nparent periplast wall, and enter red blood corpuscles. They grow into\r\nflagellates within the corpuscles, and then become free as adult\r\ntrypanosomes in the blood-stream.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.--_Trypanosoma cruzi_. Transverse section of a\r\nstriated muscle containing rounded forms of the parasite in the central\r\nportion. × 1,000 approx. (After Vianna.)]\r\n\r\n(_b_) The second mode of multiplication is one of asexual reproduction\r\n(schizogony or agamogony). It was first described by Hartmann from\r\nhypertrophied endothelial cells of the lungs. It has since been found\r\nin the cardiac muscle, in the neuroglia of the central nervous system,\r\nand in striped muscle (fig. 34). In laboratory animals it has also\r\nbeen found in the testicle and suprarenal capsules. In these tissues\r\nthe parasite is intracellular, appearing as a small rounded body with\r\nnucleus and blepharoplast, without flagellum or undulating membrane. In\r\nother words the parasite is _Leishmania_-like in the body tissues, and\r\nrecalls the organism of kala-azar.\r\n\r\nChagas considers this second mode of multiplication to be strictly\r\nasexual. By this means the number of parasites in the vertebrate host\r\nis increased, and symptoms are produced. On the other hand the first\r\nmode of multiplication, seen in the lung capillaries, is considered\r\nby Chagas to be a process of gametogony, in which sexual forms are\r\ndifferentiated. He finds that (1) the adult trypanosomes exhibit\r\na dimorphism in human blood rarely seen in artificially infected\r\nguinea-pigs. In these guinea-pigs (infected from guinea-pigs) the\r\nso-called gametogony in the lungs is seldom seen. (2) The intermediate\r\nhost, _Triatoma_ (_Conorhinus_), becomes infective if fed directly on\r\ninfected human blood, but very rarely so if fed on guinea-pigs. Chagas\r\nis led to believe that the occurrence of sexual forms constantly in\r\nthe blood of man implies a greater resistance to infection on the part\r\nof man than on the part of guinea-pigs or other animals, assuming the\r\ngeneral hypothesis that the formation of gametes represents a reaction\r\nof the Protozoön to unfavourable conditions. In human infection the\r\nnumber of parasites is always less than in laboratory animals, and\r\ntheir presence in the blood is transitory, lasting from fifteen to\r\nthirty days in acute cases. In many cases examination of the tissues\r\nat death has shown the presence of parasites in patients who did not\r\nexhibit them in the general circulation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.--_Trypanosoma cruzi_. Development in _Triatoma\r\nmegista_. _1_-_6_, forms found in the mid gut of _Triatoma_; _7_\r\nflagellate forms found in the posterior part of the gut of _Triatoma_.\r\n(After Chagas.)]\r\n\r\n_Life History in the Invertebrate Host._--About six hours after the\r\ningestion of infected blood by the bug (_Triatoma megista_), the\r\nkinetic nucleus of the trypanosome moves towards the nucleus, and the\r\nflagellum is usually lost (fig. 35, _1_-_5_). The parasite becomes\r\nrounded and _Leishmania_-like (fig. 35, _3_-_5_), and multiplies\r\nrapidly by division. After a time, multiplication having ceased,\r\nthe rounded forms become pear-shaped and develop a flagellum at the\r\nmore pointed end. Crithidial forms (fig. 35, 7) are thus produced\r\nand pass into the intestine, where they multiply and may be seen in\r\nabout twenty-five hours after the ingestion of blood. The crithidial\r\nforms may also be found in the rectum and fæces. The last stage in the\r\ninvertebrate is a small, trypanosome-like type, long and thin with a\r\nband-like nucleus and conspicuous kinetic nucleus. These parasites\r\nare found in the hind gut and in the body cavity. They find their\r\nway into the salivary glands, and are the forms (fig. 36) which are\r\ntransmissible to a new vertebrate host. The development in the bug\r\ntakes about eight days altogether, after which time the bugs are\r\ninfective.\r\n\r\nThere are thus three principal phases in the development of _T. cruzi_\r\nin _Triatoma megista_: (1) A multiplicative phase (_Leishmania_-like)\r\nin the stomach of the bug, (2) a crithidial phase, which is also\r\nmultiplicative, in the hind-gut, and (3) a trypanosome phase, which is\r\n“propagative,” and apparently passes through the wall of the alimentary\r\ncanal into the body cavity and so into the salivary glands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.--_Trypanosoma cruzi_. Forms found in the\r\nsalivary glands of _Triatoma megista_. (After Chagas.)]\r\n\r\nBrumpt found that _T. cruzi_ could live in _Cimex lectularius_,\r\n_C. boueti_, and _Ornithodorus moubata_. The _Cimex_ fæces may be\r\ninfective. Blacklock found multiplication of the parasite in _C.\r\nlectularius_.\r\n\r\n_Culture._--The trypanosome can be cultivated on Novy-MacNeal’s blood\r\nagar, and the cultural forms resemble those described in the bug.\r\n\r\n_Possible Reservoir._--Chagas thinks that probably the armadillo or\r\n“tatu” (_Dasypus novemcinctus_) may be the reservoir of _T. cruzi_.\r\nHe also thinks that _Triatoma geniculata_ is a transmitter; it lives\r\nin the burrows of the armadillo. Other carriers may be _Triatoma\r\ninfestans_ and _T. sordida_.\r\n\r\n_Clinical Features._--The trypanosomiasis of Brazil, produced by _T.\r\ncruzi_ and spread by _Triatoma_ spp. has received various names, such\r\nas oppilação, canguary, parasitic thyroiditis, and coreotrypanosis. It\r\nis also known as the human trypanosomiasis of Brazil, South American\r\ntrypanosomiasis, and Chagas’ disease.\r\n\r\nChagas[88] reports two principal forms--acute and chronic. The _acute\r\ninfection_ is rare, and is characterized by increase in the volume\r\nof the thyroid gland, pyrexia, a sensation of crackling in the skin,\r\nenlarged lymphatic glands in the neck, axilla, etc., while the liver\r\nand spleen are increased in volume. Sclerosis of the thyroid gland is\r\nfound at autopsy and fatty degeneration of the liver. During an attack\r\nof fever, trypanosomes are found in the blood. The acute form was only\r\nobserved in children.\r\n\r\n[88] _Brazil Medico_, Nov. 15, 1910. Longer account in _Mem. Inst.\r\nOswaldo Cruz_, iii, pp. 219–275. See _Sleep. Sick. Bull._, Nos. 35 and\r\n40.\r\n\r\n_In the chronic form_ Chagas reports several varieties: (_a_) A\r\npseudo-myxœdematous form, occurring in most cases, especially up to\r\nthe age of 15. There is hypertrophy of the thyroid gland or at least\r\nsigns of hypothyroidism, general hypertrophy of glands, disturbance\r\nof heart rhythm, and nervous symptoms. (_b_) The myxœdematous form\r\nis characterized by similar symptoms, especially by considerable\r\nswelling of the thyroid body, and myxœdema of the subcutaneous cellular\r\ntissue; sometimes there is a true pachydermic cachexia. (_c_) In the\r\nnervous form there are motor disturbances, aphasia, disturbances of\r\nintelligence or signs of infantilism, athetosis of the extremities\r\nand idiocy. There are also paralytic symptoms of bulbar origin,\r\ndisturbances of mastication, phonation and deglutition, and in some\r\ncases convulsive attacks. (_d_) The cardiac form, characterized by\r\ndisturbance of the heart rhythm. In all these forms the parasite is\r\nfound at autopsy in the nervous substance, brain, bulb and heart.\r\n\r\nVianna (1911)[89] has studied the histopathology of the disease.\r\nSome of the chief points are: in the heart muscle destruction of the\r\nsarcoplasm, followed by interstitial myocarditis; in the central\r\nnervous system invasion of the neuroglia cells and inflammatory\r\nreaction; in the suprarenal capsule invasion of medulla or cortex;\r\ninflammatory reaction can also be seen in the kidneys, the hypophysis\r\nand thyroid gland.\r\n\r\n[89] _Mem. Inst. Oswaldo Cruz_, iii, p. 276.\r\n\r\nRecently Chagas states[90] that “schizotrypanosomiasis” has been found\r\nin a child 15 to 20 days old, and that _Trypanosoma cruzi_ has also\r\nbeen found in a fœtus--the mother being infected with the trypanosome.\r\nThe trypanosomiasis can, then, be transmitted hereditarily.\r\n\r\n[90] _Rev. Med. S. Paulo_ (1912), xv, p. 337.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Trypanosoma lewisi*, Kent, 1881.\r\n\r\nThe trypanosome has a nucleus somewhat displaced anteriorly, about\r\none-third of the way from the anterior (flagellar) end of the body, a\r\nrelatively straight edge to the undulating membrane, and a rod-shaped\r\nblepharoplast (fig. 37, A). It averages about 25 µ long and 1·5 µ broad.\r\n\r\nMuch attention has been devoted in recent years to the elucidation\r\nof the life history of the rat parasite, _Trypanosoma lewisi_. It\r\nis usually non-pathogenic to its host. It has been shown that the\r\ntrypanosome can be transmitted from rat to rat by the rat-flea,\r\n_Ceratophyllus fasciatus_, and by _Ctenocephalus canis_ (the so-called\r\ndog-flea). (See also p. 92). The flagellate may also persist, but\r\ndoubtfully develop, in the rat-louse, _Hæmatopinus spinulosus_. These\r\nresearches may now be summarized.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.--_Trypanosoma lewisi_, from rat’s blood.

(After Minchin and Thomson.)]\r\n\r\n_Life Cycle in the Vertebrate Host._--After infection of a rat, the\r\ntrypanosomes usually appear in the animal’s blood in five to seven\r\ndays. This incubation period applies either to a natural or an\r\nartificial infection. The trypanosomes first observed in the rat’s\r\nblood are diverse in form (fig. 37), being small, medium and large\r\nin size. This diversity is explained by the rapid multiplication\r\ntaking place. A trypanosome may divide by equal longitudinal fission\r\n(fig. 37, C, D), but more commonly multiple fission occurs (fig. 37,\r\nG, H), and is unequal. Rosette forms are produced, in which the parent\r\nform can be recognized by its long flagellum (fig. 37, H) and attached\r\nto it are daughter individuals, smaller in size, from which flagella\r\nare growing. Minchin and J. D. Thomson (1912) find that the daughter\r\nforms may be set free sometimes with a crithidia-like facies (fig. 37,\r\nI), the blepharoplast being anterior but near to the nucleus. The\r\ndaughter forms, when set free, may themselves divide by binary or\r\nmultiple fission, in the latter case forming rosettes (fig. 37, K).\r\nRosette forms were described by Moore, Breinl and Hindle in 1908.\r\n\r\nLingard, some years ago, described as a distinct species, _T.\r\nlongocaudense_, certain forms with markedly elongate posterior ends\r\n(fig. 37, E). According to Minchin, “these forms appear to arise\r\nby binary fission” (fig. 37, D). These long drawn-out forms “are\r\nof constant occurrence and very numerous at a certain stage of the\r\nmultiplication period.” It is about the eighth or tenth day after\r\ninfection that the multiplication of _T. lewisi_ is at its maximum in\r\nthe rat’s blood. About the twelfth or thirteenth day the trypanosomes\r\nseen in the blood appear uniform. According to Minchin (1912)[91] the\r\nrat “gets rid of its infection entirely sooner or later, without having\r\nsuffered, apparently, any marked inconvenience from it, and is then\r\nimmune against a fresh infection with this species of trypanosome.”\r\nThere is, then, a cycle of development in the vertebrate host. Minchin\r\nnotes that the records of the pathogenicity of _T. lewisi_ in rats,\r\ncausing their death, need further investigation.\r\n\r\n[91] “Protozoa,” p. 294.\r\n\r\n_T. lewisi_ inoculated into dormice (_Myoxus nitela_) and jerboas may\r\nbecome pathogenic thereto.\r\n\r\nCarini found cysts in the lungs of rats infected with _T. lewisi_.\r\nHe thought the cysts were schizogonic stages of the trypanosome,\r\ncomparable with those found in the lungs of animals sub-inoculated\r\nwith _T. cruzi_. Delanoë (1912)[92] has found, however, that such\r\ncysts, containing eight vermicules, occurred in rats uninfected with\r\n_T. lewisi_. Delanoë concludes that the pneumocysts are independent of\r\n_T. lewisi_, and represent a new parasite, _Pneumocystis carinii_. The\r\npneumocysts may be allied to the Coccidia, and must be considered when\r\ninvestigating the life-cycle of a trypanosome in a vertebrate host.\r\nSome of the stages of _T. cruzi_ may possibly be of this nature.\r\n\r\n[92] _C. R. Acad. Sci._, clv, p. 658.\r\n\r\n_Life-cycle in the Invertebrate Host._--This occurs in fleas, and has\r\nbeen investigated in considerable detail by Minchin and Thomson in\r\n_Ceratophyllus fasciatus_, and by Nöller in _Ctenocephalus canis_ and\r\n_Ctenopsylla musculi_.\r\n\r\nWhen infected rat’s blood is taken up by the flea, the parasites pass\r\nwith the ingested blood direct to the mid-gut of the Siphonapteran.\r\nIn the flea’s stomach they multiply in a somewhat remarkable manner,\r\nnamely, by penetration of the cells of the lining epithelium, and\r\ndivision inside the epithelial cells. Inside these lining cells the\r\ntrypanosomes first grow to a large size and then form large spherical\r\nbodies, within which nuclear multiplication occurs (fig. 38, A-F).\r\nAny one of these large spherical bodies contains at first a number of\r\nnuclei, blepharoplasts and developing flagella, the original flagellum\r\nstill remaining attached for a time. The cytoplasm then divides into\r\ndaughter trypanosomes which are contained within an envelope, formed\r\nby the periplast of the parent parasite. Inside the periplast envelope\r\nare a number of daughter trypanosomes “wriggling very actively; the\r\nenvelope becomes more and more tense, and finally bursts with explosive\r\nsuddenness, setting free the flagellates, usually about eight in\r\nnumber, within the host-cell” (fig. 38, F). The daughter forms escaping\r\nfrom the host cell into the stomach lumen of the flea are fully formed,\r\nlong trypanosomes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.--_Trypanosoma lewisi_. Developmental stages\r\nfrom stomach of rat flea. O, ordinary blood type; A-F, stages occurring\r\nin gut-epithelium of flea, when the trypanosome becomes rounded and\r\nundergoes multiplication, forming in F eight daughter trypanosomes; G,\r\ntype of trypanosome resulting from such division which passes back to\r\nthe rectum. × 2,000. (After Minchin.)]\r\n\r\nThe trypanosomes (fig. 38, G) pass into the flea’s rectum. The next\r\nphase is a crithidial one. The parasites become pear-shaped, in which\r\nthe blepharoplast (kinetic nucleus) has travelled anteriorly past the\r\nnucleus towards the flagellum (fig. 39). The crithidial forms attach\r\nthemselves to the wall of the rectum, and multiply by binary fission\r\n(fig. 39, D). A stock of parasites is thus formed which, according to\r\nMinchin and Thomson, “persist for a long time in the flea--probably\r\nunder favourable conditions, for the whole life of the insect”\r\n(fig. 39, A-I).\r\n\r\nFrom the crithidial forms of the rectum, according to Minchin,\r\nsmall infective trypanosomes arise by modification morphologically\r\n(fig. 39, J--M). The flagellum grows longer and draws out more the\r\nanterior part of the body, the blepharoplast migrates posteriorly,\r\nbehind the nucleus, and carries with it the flagellar origin. These\r\ntrypanosomes are small, but broad and stumpy (fig. 39, N), and can\r\ninfect a rat. Minchin and Thomson formerly considered that the small,\r\nstumpy, infective trypanosomes pass forwards from the rectum into the\r\nstomach, and “appear to be regurgitated into the rat’s blood when the\r\nflea feeds.” However, the small infective trypanosomes were previously\r\ndescribed by Swellengrebel and Strickland.[93] They may be found in the\r\nflea’s fæces. Nöller (1912)[94] has found that the development of _T.\r\nlewisi_ proceeds quite well in the dog flea (_Ctenocephalus canis_) in\r\nGermany. Wenyon confirms this, and states that the human flea, _Pulex\r\nirritans_, and the Indian rat-flea, _Xenopsylla cheopis_, are also able\r\nto serve as true hosts for _T. lewisi_.\r\n\r\n[93] _Parasitology_, iii, p. 360.\r\n\r\n[94] _Arch. f. Protistenkunde_, xxv, p. 386.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.--_Trypanosoma lewisi_. Developmental stages\r\nfrom rectum of rat-flea.

(After Minchin.)]\r\n\r\nNöller stated that rats were not infected with _T. lewisi_ by infective\r\nfleas biting them, but by the rats licking up the fæces passed by\r\nthe fleas while feeding. This is not in agreement with Minchin and\r\nThomson’s earlier views of regurgitation, which, apparently, they have\r\nnow abandoned.[95] Wenyon (1912) confirms Nöller’s experiments. He took\r\na dog flea, containing infective trypanosomes in its fæces, and allowed\r\nit to feed on a clean rat. The fæces of the flea, passed while feeding,\r\nwere carefully “collected on a cover glass and taken up in culture\r\nfluid with a fine glass pipette.” The contents of the pipette were\r\ndischarged into the mouth of a second clean rat. Injury to the rat’s\r\nmouth was carefully avoided. The first rat, on which the infective flea\r\nwas fed, did not become infected, while the second rat, in whose mouth\r\ninfective flea fæces were placed, became infected in six days.\r\n\r\n[95] Report to Advis. Comm. Trop. Dis. Research Fund for 1913, p. 74.\r\n\r\nWhen infective forms of _T. lewisi_ have been developed within the gut\r\nof a rat flea, they may enter and infect the vertebrate host by[96]\r\n(_a_) being crushed and eaten by the rodent; (_b_) the rat may lick\r\nits fur on which an infected flea has just passed infective excrement;\r\nor (_c_) the rat may lick, and infect with flea excrement, the wound\r\nproduced by the bite of the flea.\r\n\r\n[96] Nuttall, _Parasitology_, v, p. 275.\r\n\r\nThe time taken for the full development of _T. lewisi_ in the flea is\r\nabout six days. The intracellular phase is at its height about the end\r\nof the first day; the crithidial phase, in the flea’s rectum, begins\r\nduring the second day; the stumpy, infective trypanosomes are developed\r\nin the rectum about the end of the fifth day.\r\n\r\nWenyon[97] writes that, “the fleas, when once infected with _T.\r\nlewisi_, remain infected for long periods, for though many small\r\ninfective trypanosomes are washed out of the gut at each feed, those\r\nthat remain behind multiply to re-establish the infection of the hind\r\ngut. Further, the infection is still maintained even if the flea is\r\nnourished on a human being, so that fresh human blood does not appear\r\nto be destructive to the infective forms in the flea.”\r\n\r\n[97] Report to Advis. Comm. Trop. Dis. Research Fund, October, 1912,\r\np. 91. See also _Journ. Lond. Sch. Trop. Med._, ii, p. 119.\r\n\r\nThe best method of controlling fleas during experiments is that due to\r\nNöller. He adopted the method of showmen who exhibit performing fleas,\r\nand secure them on very fine silver wire.\r\n\r\nOf fleas fed on an infected rat only about 20 per cent. become\r\ninfective. About 80 per cent. are immune. If fleas are examined\r\ntwenty-four hours after feeding, trypanosomes will be found in all, so\r\nthat many of the parasites are destined to degenerate.\r\n\r\nIt may be of interest to note that Gonder[98] (1911) has shown\r\nthat a strain of _T. lewisi_ resistant to arsenophenylglycin loses\r\nits resistance after passage through the rat-louse, _Hæmatopinus\r\nspinulosus_. These experiments suggest that physiological “acquired\r\ncharacters” may be lost by passage through an invertebrate host.\r\n\r\n[98] _Centralbl. f. Bakt._, Orig., lxi, p. 102.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Trypanosoma brucei*, Plimmer and Bradford, 1899.\r\n\r\n_Trypanosoma brucei_ was discovered by Sir D. Bruce in 1894 in cattle\r\nin Zululand and was named _T. brucei_ by Plimmer and Bradford in 1899\r\nin honour of its discoverer. This trypanosome is of considerable\r\neconomic importance, as it is responsible for the fatal tsetse fly\r\ndisease, or “nagana,” in cattle, horses and dogs. The disease is widely\r\ndistributed in Africa and is transmitted from host to host by the\r\ntsetse, _Glossina morsitans_, and other species of _Glossina_. The\r\nvirus is maintained in nature in certain big game, such as wildebeest,\r\nbushbuck and koodoo, which thus act as living reservoirs of disease\r\nfrom which the tsetse may become infected. These reservoir hosts are\r\nnot injured, apparently, by the presence of the parasites.\r\n\r\n_T. brucei_ is rapidly fatal to the small laboratory animals, such as\r\nrats and mice. Horses, asses and dogs practically always succumb to its\r\nattacks, while a very small number of cattle recover from “nagana.” The\r\ndisease is characterized by fever, destruction of red blood corpuscles,\r\nsevere emaciation and by an infiltration of coagulated lymph in the\r\nsubcutaneous tissue of the neck, abdomen and extremities giving a\r\nswollen appearance thereto. The natural reservoirs in which _T.\r\nbrucei_ has been long acclimatized are unaffected by the trypanosomes,\r\nwhile the newer hosts, such as imported cattle in Africa, are rapidly\r\ndestroyed by their action.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.--_Trypanosoma brucei._ × 2,000. (After Laveran\r\nand Mesnil.)]\r\n\r\nThe general morphology and life history in the vertebrate host is that\r\nof a typical trypanosome (fig. 40). Its length is from 12 µ to 35 µ,\r\nits breadth from 1·5 µ to 4 µ. Multiplication by longitudinal division\r\nproceeds in the peripheral blood (fig. 26), while latent, leishmaniform\r\nbodies are produced in the internal organs.\r\n\r\nBruce and colleagues[99] have quite recently (June, 1914) described\r\nthe development of a Zululand strain of _T. brucei_ in _G. morsitans_.\r\nThe tsetse flies were bred out in Nyasaland. In vertebrate blood\r\nthe _brucei_ strain was polymorphic. The development was like that\r\nfound for _T. gambiense_ in _G. palpalis_ (fig. 30), and by Bruce\r\nand colleagues for _T. rhodesiense_ in _G. morsitans_ in Nyasaland.\r\nLong trypanosomes were found in the proventriculus of the tsetse.\r\nCrithidial, rounded or encysted, and immature “blood forms” occurred in\r\nthe salivary glands; and finally infective, stumpy, “blood forms” were\r\ndifferentiated in the salivary glands. The period of development of _T.\r\nbrucei_ in _G. morsitans_ takes about three weeks, and then the fly\r\nbecomes infective. Bruce believes that _T. rhodesiense_ of Nyasaland\r\nand _T. brucei_ of Zululand are the same, their cycles of development\r\nin _G. morsitans_ being “marvellously alike.” (But see Laveran, p. 80.)\r\n\r\n[99] _Proc. Roy. Soc._, B, lxxxvii, p. 526.\r\n\r\n_T. brucei_ has been cultivated with difficulty by Novy and MacNeal,\r\nusing blood agar. The best treatment for nagana is arsenic in some form.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that more than one trypanosome has been confused under\r\nthe name _T. brucei_, more especially as the occurrence of many species\r\nof trypanosomes in various animals in Africa was not suspected\r\nuntil comparatively recent times. It has been shown by Stephens and\r\nBlacklock (1913) that the original Zululand strain of _T. brucei_\r\nwas monomorphic, while the organism sent from Uganda, and at the\r\ntime believed by Bruce to be the same as the Zululand trypanosome,\r\nhas been found to be polymorphic, with morphological resemblances\r\nto _T. rhodesiense_. Stephens and Blacklock[100] have suggested the\r\nname _T. ugandæ_ for the polymorphic trypanosome, which, however, has\r\nmarked resemblances with *Trypanosoma pecaudi*, and they are, perhaps,\r\nidentical. _T. pecaudi_ was the name given by Laveran[101] in 1907 to\r\nthe causal agent of “baleri” in equines and sheep in the French Sudan.\r\n_T. pecaudi_, which is dimorphic, is widely distributed in Africa.\r\nAn extremely small number of both _T. pecaudi_ and _T. ugandæ_ have\r\nbeen shown to possess posterior nuclei. _T. pecaudi_ is transmitted by\r\nvarious species of _Glossina_, and is said to develop in the gut and\r\nproboscis of the fly.\r\n\r\n[100] _Proc. Roy. Soc._, B, lxxxvi, p. 187.\r\n\r\n[101] _C.R. Acad. Sci._, cxliv, p. 243.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Bruce and colleagues (1914), examining a strain sent\r\nfrom Zululand in 1913, state that _T. brucei_ is polymorphic. Bruce\r\n(1914) suggests that passage through laboratory hosts has influenced\r\nand altered the morphology of the parasite.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Trypanosoma evansi*, Steel, 1885.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Spirochæta evansi_, Steel, 1885; _Hæmatomonas evansi_,\r\n  Crookshank, 1886; _Trichomonas evansi_, Crookshank, 1886.\r\n\r\n_Trypanosoma evansi_, first found by Evans in 1880, in India, is the\r\ncausal agent of the disease known as “surra.” The malady affects more\r\nparticularly horses, mules, camels and cattle in India and neighbouring\r\ncountries, such as Burma and Indo-China. It occurs also in Java, the\r\nPhilippines, Mauritius and North Africa. Elephants may be affected.\r\nA serious outbreak among cattle in Mauritius occurred in 1902, the\r\ndisease being imported into the island. The symptoms are fever,\r\nemaciation, œdema, great muscular weakness and paralysis culminating in\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n_T. evansi_ varies from 18 µ to 34 µ in length and 1·5 µ to 2 µ in\r\nbreadth. It has a pointed posterior extremity, and, anteriorly,\r\nthere is a free portion to the flagellum (fig. 41). It is possibly\r\nmonomorphic, but a few broad forms occur. The trypanosome multiplies by\r\nlongitudinal fission in the blood. Rounded leishmaniform stages occur\r\nin the spleen of the vertebrate host, which stages Walker[102] (1912)\r\nconsiders to be phases of schizogony.\r\n\r\n[102] _Philippine Journ. Sc._ (Sect. B), vii, p. 53.\r\n\r\nThe parasite is transmitted in nature by various species of _Tabanus_\r\nand _Stomoxys_, though at present little is known of the life-history\r\nwithin these invertebrate hosts.\r\n\r\nDogs are said to contract the disease by feeding on animals dead of\r\nsurra.\r\n\r\nA variety of _T. evansi_ is the cause of “mbori” in dromedaries in\r\nAfrica (Sahara and Sudan). Another possible variety, or closely allied\r\nform, is _T. soudanense_, the causal agent of “el debab” in camels and\r\nhorses in North Africa, especially Algeria and Egypt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.--_Trypanosoma evansi_. × 2,000. (Original. From\r\npreparation by Fantham.)]\r\n\r\nAn extraordinary example of the possible infection of a human being\r\nwith an animal trypanosome is recorded in the case of Professor\r\nLanfranchi, of the Veterinary School, Parma. The Professor became\r\ninfected with trypanosomes, although only nagana and surra were\r\nmaintained in his laboratory, and he himself had never visited the\r\ntropics. He suffered from irregular attacks of fever and was œdematous,\r\nbut his mind remained clear. The identification of the trypanosome\r\nfrom Lanfranchi’s blood has been a matter of great difficulty.\r\nApparently Mesnil and Blanchard (1914)[103] consider the strain found\r\nin the patient is almost indistinguishable in its reactions from _T.\r\ngambiense_, though the parasite is monomorphic. Lanfranchi considers\r\nthat he was infected with _T. evansi_.\r\n\r\n[103] _Bull. Soc. Path. Exot._, vii, p. 196.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Trypanosoma equinum*, Voges, 1901.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Trypanosoma elmassiani_, Lignières.\r\n\r\n_Trypanosoma equinum_ was found by Elmassian to be the cause of the\r\nfatal disease, “mal de caderas,” of horses and dogs, in South America\r\n(Paraguay, Argentine, Bolivia). The name refers to the fact that in\r\nthe disease, as in other trypanosomiases, the hind quarters become\r\nparalysed. Cattle are refractory to inoculation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.--_Trypanosoma equinum_. × 2,000. (After Laveran\r\nand Mesnil.)]\r\n\r\n_T. equinum_ is about 22 µ to 24 µ long and about 1·5 µ broad\r\n(fig. 42). Although this trypanosome is very active, yet it is\r\ncharacterized by the blepharoplast (kinetic nucleus) being very minute\r\nor even absent, as the granule sometimes seen may be the basal granule\r\nof the flagellum.\r\n\r\nThe mode of transmission of _T. equinum_ is not known with absolute\r\ncertainty. Migone has shown that the parasite causes a fatal disease\r\nin the large South American rodent, the capybara (_Hydrochœrus\r\ncapybara_). This animal appears to be a reservoir of the parasite. Dogs\r\nmay become infected by eating diseased capybaras, and it is suggested\r\nthat the infection is spread from the dogs to horses by the agency of\r\nfleas. Some authorities consider that _T. equinum_ may be spread by\r\nvarious _Tabanidæ_ and by _Stomoxys_. Neiva (1913)[104] doubts all\r\nthese modes of transmission in Brazil, and suggests _Chrysops_ or\r\n_Triatoma_ as vectors.\r\n\r\n[104] _Brazil Medico_, xxvii, p. 366.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Trypanosoma equiperdum*, Doflein, 1901.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Trypanosoma rougeti_, Laveran and Mesnil.\r\n\r\nThe malady of horses known as “dourine” or “mal du coït” is due\r\nto a trypanosome, _T. equiperdum_, discovered by Rouget in 1894.\r\n“Dourine”--also known as “stallion disease” or “covering disease”--is\r\nfound among horses and asses in Europe, India, North Africa and North\r\nAmerica. The trypanosome is transmitted by coitus, and so far as is\r\nknown not by insect agency.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.--_Trypanosoma equiperdum._ × 2000\r\napproximately. (Original. From preparation by Fantham.)]\r\n\r\nThe progress of the disease may be considered under three periods. The\r\n_period of œdema_, when signs of œdema of the genitalia are seen. The\r\nœdema is generally painless and non-inflammatory. This period lasts\r\nabout a month. It is succeeded by the _period of eruption_, which\r\nsets in about two months after infection. Circular œdematous areas\r\n(“plaques”), often about the size of a two-shilling piece, appear\r\nunder the skin of the sides and hind quarters, and also, at times,\r\nunder the skin of the neck, thighs and shoulders. The eruption is\r\nvariable, but usually lasts about a week and leaves the animal in an\r\nenfeebled condition. Gland enlargement and swelling of the joints and\r\nsynovia also may occur. The third period of the disease is described\r\nas that _of anæmia and paralysis_. The animal becomes very anæmic,\r\nemaciation is marked, superficial non-healing abscesses often form, and\r\nconjunctivitis and ulcerative keratitis can occur. Paralysis ensues,\r\nand in from two to eighteen months the animal dies. In the acute form\r\nof the disease the animal may die after the first period from acute\r\nparalysis.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to find the trypanosomes in naturally infected animals,\r\nand they are best obtained from the plaques of the eruption. Apparently\r\nthe parasite occurs more in the lymph than in the blood.\r\n\r\nRuminants are said to be refractory to this trypanosome.\r\n\r\n_T. equiperdum_ is about 25 µ to 28 µ in length on an average, but\r\nvaries from 16 µ to 35 µ. Its cytoplasm is relatively clear, and does\r\nnot show chromatic granules (fig. 43). It is stated to be monomorphic.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown recently by Blacklock and Yorke (1913)[105] that\r\nthere is another trypanosome giving rise to dourine in horses. This\r\ntrypanosome is dimorphic (resembling _T. pecaudi_ and _T. ugandæ_), and\r\nis named _T. equi_. Previously _T. equiperdum_ and _T. equi_ had been\r\nconfused.\r\n\r\n[105] _Proc. Roy. Soc._, B, lxxxvii, p. 89.\r\n\r\nUhlenhuth, Hübner and Worthe have demonstrated the presence of\r\nendotoxins in _T. equiperdum_. These endotoxins may be set free by\r\ntrypanolysis.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Trypanosoma theileri*, Bruce, 1902.\r\n\r\nThis parasite, 60 µ to 70 µ long, and 4 µ to 5 µ broad, is\r\ndistinguished for its large size, though it is not so large as _T.\r\ningens_ from Uganda oxen, whose length may be 72 µ to 122 µ, and\r\nbreadth 7 µ to 10 µ. The posterior end of _T. theileri_ is drawn out.\r\nSmall forms of the flagellate are known, 25 µ to 53 µ in length.\r\nProbably other forms of the parasite have the nucleus posterior, and\r\nthese flagellates were formerly separated as _T. transvaaliense_\r\n(Laveran, 1902). Myoneme fibrils may be seen on its body. The\r\npathogenicity of this organism is doubtful, it was formerly thought\r\nto be the causal agent of “gall-sickness” in cattle in South Africa.\r\n_T. theileri_ also occurs in Togoland, German East Africa, and\r\nTranscaucasia. Allied or identical parasites occur in cattle in India.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.--_Trypanosoma theileri._ × 2,000. (After\r\nLaveran and Mesnil.)]\r\n\r\n_Trypanosoma theileri_, specific to cattle, is perhaps transmitted by\r\nthe fly _Hippobosca rufipes_ in South Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Trypanosoma hippicum*, Darling, 1910.\r\n\r\n_Trypanosoma hippicum_ causes the disease of mules known as\r\n“murrina.”[106] It was found in mules imported to Panama from the\r\nUnited States. It can live in other equines. The parasite varies\r\nfrom 18 µ to 28 µ in length, and is from 1·5 µ to 3 µ broad. Its\r\nundulating membrane is little folded. The trypanosome has a noticeable\r\nblepharoplast. It can penetrate mucous membranes, and it is thought\r\nthat the trypanosome may be transmitted during coitus. It may also\r\nbe spread mechanically by species of _Musca_, _Sarcophaga_ and\r\n_Compsomyia_, sucking the wounds of infected animals and carrying over\r\nthe trypanosomes to wounds on healthy ones.\r\n\r\n[106] _Bull. Soc. Path. Exot._, iii, p. 381.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Endotrypanum schaudinni*, Mesnil and Brimont, 1908.\r\n\r\nThis organism was discovered in the blood of a sloth (_Cholœpus\r\ndidactylus_), in South America (French Guiana).[107] It possesses\r\nspecial interest, in that the best known form of the organism is\r\nendoglobular, inhabiting the erythrocytes of the sloth. A free\r\ntrypanosome in the same animal was considered to be different from the\r\nendoglobular form, which was somewhat like a peg-top, and possessed a\r\nshort flagellum. Darling[108] (November, 1914) has seen the organism in\r\nPanama. He describes free crithidial forms in shed blood, but not in\r\nthe blood-stream of the sloth.\r\n\r\n[107] _C. R. Soc. Biol._, lxv, p. 581.\r\n\r\n[108] _Journ. Med. Research_, xxxi, p. 195.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Trypanosoma boylei*, Lafont, 1912.\r\n\r\nThis is a parasite of the Reduviid bug, _Conorhinus rubrofasciatus_.\r\nThe insect attacks man in Mauritius, Réunion and other places.\r\nLafont infected rats and mice by intraperitoneal injection with the\r\ngut-contents of infected bugs. Trypanosomes appeared in the mice. Other\r\nflagellate types were assumed by the parasites in the bug.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONOMORPHIC TRYPANOSOMES.\r\n\r\nA number of trypanosomes, characterized by relative uniformity in\r\nsize and structure, may be considered under this heading. They occur\r\nin cattle, sheep, goats and horses in Africa, especially West Africa.\r\nMorphologically, they are characterized by the posterior (aflagellar)\r\npart of the body being swollen, while the anterior part narrows. The\r\nnucleus is central and situated at the commencement of the narrowing of\r\nthe body. The blepharoplast is almost terminal, the undulating membrane\r\nis narrow and not markedly folded, so that the flagellar border lies\r\nclose to or along the body. The flagellum may or may not possess a free\r\nportion.\r\n\r\nSome recent workers have considered that _T. brucei_ (Zululand strain)\r\nand _T. evansi_ are also monomorphic, but they do not exhibit the\r\ngeneral characteristics outlined above. _T. brucei_ and _T. evansi_\r\nhave already been considered separately.\r\n\r\nThe monomorphic trypanosomes, as defined above, include:--\r\n\r\n\r\n*Trypanosoma vivax*, Ziemann, 1905.\r\n\r\nThis trypanosome[109] occurs in cattle, sheep and goats, and was\r\nfirst found in the Cameroons. It is fatal to cattle. Equines are also\r\naffected. Antelopes are the possible reservoirs of the trypanosome. It\r\nis probably transmitted by _Glossina palpalis_ and other tsetse flies.\r\nIts movement is very active. It possesses a free flagellum (fig. 45)\r\nand it averages 23 µ to 24 µ in length. _T. cazalboui_ (Laveran,\r\n1906)--the causal agent of “souma” in bovines and equines in the French\r\nSudan--is probably synonymous with _T. vivax_.\r\n\r\n[109] See Bruce and colleagues (1910), _Proc. Roy. Soc._, B, lxxxiii,\r\np. 15.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.--_Trypanosoma vivax_. × 2,000. (Original. From\r\npreparation by Fantham.)]\r\n\r\n*Trypanosoma capræ* (Kleine, 1910) is allied, but is somewhat broader\r\nand more massive. It was found in goats in Tanganyika.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Trypanosoma congolense*, Broden, 1904.\r\n\r\n  Probable synonyms.--_Trypanosoma dimorphon_, Laveran and Mesnil,\r\n  1904; _Trypanosoma nanum_, Laveran, 1905; _Trypanosoma pecorum_,\r\n  Bruce, 1910; _Trypanosoma confusum_, Montgomery, 1909.\r\n\r\nThis trypanosome causes disease among horses (_e.g._, Gambia horse\r\nsickness), cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, and dogs. It is widely\r\ndistributed in Central Africa (_e.g._, Gambia, Congo, Uganda,\r\nNyasaland), the strain probably being maintained naturally in big game.\r\nIt is transmitted by various _Glossinæ_, and perhaps by _Tabanus_\r\nand _Stomoxys_. It is said to develop in the gut and proboscis of\r\n_Glossina palpalis_ and _G. morsitans_. The trypanosome averages 13 µ\r\nto 14 µ in length and has no free flagellum (fig. 46). It is about 2 µ\r\nbroad. Formerly _T. nanum_ and _T. pecorum_ were said to differ in\r\ntheir pathogenicity, the former being said not to infect the smaller\r\nlaboratory animals. Yorke and Blacklock (1913), however, consider that\r\nthe virulence varies and that these trypanosomes are probably the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.--_Trypanosoma congolense_. × 2,000. (Original.\r\nFrom preparation by Fantham.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.--_Trypanosoma uniforme_. × 2,000. (Original.\r\nFrom preparation by Fantham.)]\r\n\r\nThe _T. dimorphon_ originally obtained by Dutton and Todd (1903) in\r\nGambian horse sickness has been shown to be a mixture of _T. vivax_ and\r\n_T. congolense_.\r\n\r\n*Trypanosoma simiae* (_T. ignotum_) is like _T. congolense_. It\r\naverages 17·5 µ long. It is virulent to monkeys and pigs.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Trypanosoma uniforme*, Bruce, 1910.\r\n\r\nThis trypanosome was found in oxen in Uganda.[110] It can be inoculated\r\nto oxen, goats and sheep, but is refractory to dogs, rats and\r\nguinea-pigs. It has been found in antelopes. It resembles _T. vivax_,\r\nbut is smaller (fig. 47), averaging 16 µ in length. A free flagellum is\r\npresent. It is transmitted by _Glossinæ_.\r\n\r\n[110] _Proc. Roy. Soc._, B, lxxxiii, p. 176.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.--_Trypanosoma rotatorium_, from blood of a\r\nfrog. × 1,400. (After Laveran and Mesnil.)]\r\n\r\nMany other trypanosomes occur in mammals, while birds, reptiles,\r\namphibia (fig. 48) and fish also harbour them. The discussion of these\r\nforms does not come within the scope of the present work. They are\r\ndealt with in Laveran and Mesnil’s “Trypanosomes et Trypanosomiases,”\r\n2nd edit., 1912.\r\n\r\nGENERAL NOTE ON DEVELOPMENT OF TRYPANOSOMES IN GLOSSINA.\r\n\r\nBefore concluding the account of trypanosomes, it may be of interest to\r\nremark that several African trypanosomes develop in various species of\r\n_Glossina_, and are found in different parts of the alimentary tract\r\nand in the proboscis. Thus (_a_) _T. vivax_, _T. uniforme_ and _T.\r\ncapræ_ develop in the fly’s proboscis (labial cavity and hypopharynx)\r\nonly; (_b_) _T. congolense_, _T. simiæ_ and _T. pecaudi_ develop first\r\nin the gut of the fly and then pass forward to its proboscis; and (_c_)\r\n_T. gambiense_ and _T. rhodesiense_ develop first in the gut and later\r\ninvade the salivary glands of the tsetse. The proboscis or the salivary\r\nglands in such cases are termed by Duke[111] the _anterior station_ of\r\nthe trypanosome, wherein it completes its development.\r\n\r\n[111] _Repts. Sleeping Sickness Commission Roy. Soc._ (1913), xiii,\r\np. 82.\r\n\r\nADAPTATION OF TRYPANOSOMES.\r\n\r\nThese flagellates may exhibit power of adaptation to changes of\r\nenvironment, such as those due to the administration of drugs,\r\nchange of host, etc. A few examples of such mutations may be briefly\r\nconsidered:--\r\n\r\n(1) _Blepharoplastless Trypanosomes_.--_T. brucei_ may become resistant\r\nto pyronin and oxazine. Accompanying this drug resistance is a change\r\nin morphology, namely, the loss of the blepharoplast (Werbitzki).[112]\r\nA race or strain of blepharoplastless trypanosomes may be thus produced\r\nwhich retains its characteristic feature after as many as 130 passages\r\n(Laveran).[113] Oxazine is the more powerful drug, and it acts directly\r\non the blepharoplast. (Compare the natural blepharoplastless character\r\nof _T. equinum_.)\r\n\r\n[112] _Centralbl. f. Bakt._ (1910), Orig., liii, p. 303.\r\n\r\n[113] _Bull. Soc. Path. Exot._, iv, p. 233.\r\n\r\n(2) Reference has been made on p. 93 to the experiments of Gonder,\r\nwho showed that a strain of _T. lewisi_ rendered resistant to\r\narsenophenylglycin lost its resistance after passage through the rat\r\nlouse. This is in marked contrast with the retention of drug resistance\r\nduring passage by inoculation from rat to rat.\r\n\r\n(3) _T. lewisi_ from the blood of a rat when transferred to a snake\r\nseems largely to disappear, as very few flagellates are seen. When\r\nblood from the snake is inoculated into a clean rat, then trypanosomes\r\nreappear in the rat, but they are not all like those originally\r\ninoculated. It seems certain that, in such a case, changes in form and\r\nvirulence of the trypanosome have occurred. Similar experiments were\r\nmade with _T. brucei_ from rats to adders and other animals and back to\r\nrats. Changes in the form and virulence of _T. brucei_ occurred.\r\n\r\nThese interesting experiments were performed by Wendelstadt and\r\nFellmer.[114]\r\n\r\n[114] _Zeitschr. f. Immunitatsforschung_, iv, p. 422 (1909), and v,\r\np. 337 (1910).\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Herpetomonas*, Saville Kent, 1881.\r\n\r\n_Herpetomonas_ is a generic name for certain flagellates possessing a\r\nvermiform or snake-like body, a nucleus placed approximately centrally,\r\nand a blepharoplast (kinetic nucleus) near the flagellar end. There\r\nis no undulating membrane (fig. 49, _a_). The organisms included\r\nin this genus certainly possess one flagellum, while according to\r\nProwazek (1904) _Herpetomonas muscæ-domesticæ_, the type species,\r\npossesses two flagella united by a membrane. Patton,[115] Porter[116]\r\nand others affirm, however, that the biflagellate character of _H.\r\nmuscæ-domesticæ_ (from the gut of the house-fly) is merely due to\r\nprecocious division. The matter is further complicated by the generic\r\nname _Leptomonas_, given by Kent in 1881, to an uniflagellate organism\r\nfound by Bütschli in the intestine of the Nematode worm, _Trilobus\r\ngracilis_. This parasite, _Leptomonas bütschlii_, has not yet been\r\ncompletely studied. Until these controversial points relating to\r\nthe identity or separation of _Herpetomonas_ and _Leptomonas_ have\r\nbeen satisfactorily settled, we may retain the better known name\r\n_Herpetomonas_ for such uniflagellate, vermiform organisms. However,\r\nthe name _Leptomonas_, having been used by Kent two pages earlier\r\nin his book (“Manual of the Infusoria”) than _Herpetomonas_, would\r\nhave priority if the two generic names were ultimately shown to be\r\nsynonymous.\r\n\r\n[115] _Arch. f. Protist._, xiii, p. 1.\r\n\r\n[116] _Parasitology_, ii, p. 367.\r\n\r\nA full discussion of these interesting and important flagellates hardly\r\ncomes within the purview of the present work; brief mention can only be\r\ngiven here to certain species.\r\n\r\nThe Herpetomonads occur principally in the digestive tracts of insects,\r\nsuch as Diptera and Hemiptera. They are also known in the guts of\r\nfleas and lice, but are not confined to blood-sucking insects. One\r\nexample, _H. ctenocephali_ (Fantham, 1912)[117] occurs in the digestive\r\ntracts of dog fleas, _Ctenocephalus canis_, in England, France,\r\nGermany, Italy, India, Tunis, etc. It is a natural flagellate of the\r\nflea, and might easily be confused with stages of blood parasites in\r\nthe gut of the dog flea. Dog fleas are stated by Basile to transmit\r\ncanine kala-azar, which is believed to be the same as human infantile\r\nkala-azar. Confusion is further likely to arise since herpetomonads\r\npass through pre-flagellate, flagellate and post-flagellate or\r\nencysted stages; pre- and post-flagellate stages being oval or rounded\r\nand _Leishmania_-like. The post-flagellate stages are shed in the\r\nfæces, and are the cross-infective stages by means of which new hosts\r\nare infected by the mouth. The possible presence of such natural\r\nflagellates must always be considered when experimenting with fleas,\r\nlice, mosquitoes, etc., as possible vectors of pathogenic flagellates\r\nlike _Leishmania_ and _Trypanosoma_. _H. pediculi_ (Fantham, 1912)\r\noccurs in human body lice.[118] See further remarks on pp. 107, 112.\r\n\r\n[117] _Bull. Path. Exot._, vi, p. 254.\r\n\r\n[118] _Proc. Roy. Soc._, B, lxxxiv, p. 505.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.--_a_, _Herpetomonas_; _b_, _Crithidia_; _c_,\r\n_Trypanosoma_. (After Porter.)]\r\n\r\nLaveran and Franchini (1913–14)[119] have recently succeeded in\r\ninoculating _Herpetomonas ctenocephali_, from the gut of the dog flea,\r\nintraperitoneally into white mice, and producing an experimental\r\nleishmaniasis in the mice. A dog was also infected. They have also\r\nsucceeded in infecting mice with _H. pattoni_--a natural flagellate of\r\nthe rat flea--by mixing infected rat fleas with the food of the mice,\r\nand by causing them to ingest infected fæces of rat fleas. Further,\r\nthey have shown that infection with the herpetomonas occurs naturally\r\nby this method, that is, by the rodents eating the fleas and not by the\r\ninsects inoculating the flagellates into the vertebrates when sucking\r\nblood. These experiments shed an interesting light on the probable\r\norigin of _Leishmania_ and its cultural herpetomonad stage, which were\r\nvery probably once parasitic flagellates in the gut of an insect.\r\n\r\n[119] _C. R. Acad. Sci._, clvii, pp. 423, 744. _Ibid._, clviii,\r\npp. 450, 770. _Bull. Soc. Path. Exot._, vii, 605.\r\n\r\nFantham and Porter[120] (1914–15) have shown that young mice may be\r\ninoculated or fed with _Herpetomonas jaculum_, from the gut of the\r\nHemipteran, _Nepa cinerea_ (the so-called “water-scorpion”), with fatal\r\nresults. The pathogenic effects are like those of kala-azar. They also\r\nshowed that the post-flagellate stages of the herpetomonads seemed most\r\ncapable of developing in the vertebrate.\r\n\r\n[120] _Proc. Camb. Philosoph. Soc._, xviii, p. 39.\r\n\r\n  A herpetomonad, _H. davidi_, has been found in the latex of species\r\n  of the plant-genus _Euphorbia_ in Mauritius, India, Portugal, etc. It\r\n  is apparently transmitted to the plants by _Hemiptera_. The plants\r\n  sometimes suffer from “flagellosis.”\r\n\r\nFranchini (1913)[121] has described a new parasite, _Hæmocystozoon\r\nbrasiliense_, from the blood of a man who had lived in Brazil for many\r\nyears. It possesses flagellate and rounded stages, and is closely\r\nallied to the herpetomonads.\r\n\r\n[121] _Bull. Soc. Path. Exot._, vi, pp. 156, 333, 377.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Crithidia*, Léger, 1902, emend. Patton, 1908.\r\n\r\n_Crithidia_ is the generic name of vermiform flagellates with a central\r\nnucleus, a blepharoplast or kinetic nucleus in the neighbourhood of the\r\nprincipal nucleus, and a rudimentary undulating membrane bordered by a\r\nflagellum arising from a basal granule, which is the centrosome of the\r\nkinetic nucleus (fig. 49_b_). The anterior or flagellar end of the body\r\nis attenuated and fades off as the undulating membrane.\r\n\r\n_Crithidia fasciculata_, the type species, was found by Léger in the\r\nalimentary canal of _Anopheles maculipennis_. Crithidia occur in\r\nbugs, flies, fleas,[122] and ticks. Some of them are found in the\r\nbody-fluid of the invertebrate host as well as in the gut. Others\r\nmay be restricted to the body cavity or intestine respectively. _C.\r\nmelophagia_ from the sheep-ked, _Melophagus ovinus_, and _C. hyalommæ_\r\nfrom the hæmocœlic fluid of the tick, _Hyalomma ægyptium_, pass into\r\nthe ovaries and eggs of their hosts, and the young keds or ticks are\r\nborn infected.\r\n\r\n[122] See Porter, _Parasitology_, iv, p. 237.\r\n\r\n_C. fasciculata_ has been shown by Laveran and Franchini to be\r\ninoculable into white mice, producing a sort of experimental\r\nleishmaniasis therein. In one case cutaneous lesions were produced like\r\nthose of Oriental sore.\r\n\r\nCrithidia are natural flagellates of Arthropoda, with their own\r\npre-flagellate, flagellate and post-flagellate stages, and must not be\r\nconfused with transitory crithidial stages of trypanosomes.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Leishmania*, Ross, 1903.\r\n\r\nWith an oval body containing nucleus and blepharoplast (kinetic\r\nnucleus) but no flagellum. An intracellular parasite in the vertebrate\r\nhost.\r\n\r\nIncluded in the genus _Leishmania_ are three species, namely:--\r\n\r\n  (1) _Leishmania donovani_, Laveran and Mesnil, 1903, the parasite\r\n      of Indian kala-azar, a generalized systemic disease, usually\r\n      fatal, occurring in subjects of all ages.\r\n  (2) _Leishmania tropica_, Wright, 1903, the parasite of Delhi boil,\r\n      Oriental sore, Aleppo button--a localized, cutaneous disease,\r\n      usually benign.\r\n  (3) _Leishmania infantum_, Nicolle, 1908, the parasite of infantile\r\n      kala-azar, occurring in children (and a few adults) around\r\n      the shores of the Mediterranean. The disease is perhaps a\r\n      form of Indian kala-azar, and the parasite is probably identical\r\n      with _L. donovani_.\r\n\r\nThese diseases may be termed collectively leishmaniases. The morphology\r\nof the various species is practically identical.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Leishmania donovani*, Laveran and Mesnil, 1903.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Piroplasma donovani_, Laveran and Mesnil.\r\n\r\nThe parasite of Indian kala-azar was demonstrated in 1900 by Leishman\r\nfrom a _post-mortem_ examination of a case of “Dum-Dum fever,” but\r\ndetails were not published till May, 1903. In July, 1903, Donovan found\r\nsimilar bodies from cases in Madras. Rogers succeeded in cultivating\r\nthe parasite in July, 1904.[123] The original centre of the disease was\r\nprobably Assam; it occurs also in Madras, Ceylon, Burma, Indo-China,\r\nChina and Syria. A variety of this leishmaniasis is found in the Sudan.\r\nThe patient becomes emaciated, with a greatly enlarged spleen. There is\r\nanæmia and leucopenia.\r\n\r\n[123] The literature up to 1912, on kala-azar and other leishmaniases\r\nis reviewed in the _Kala-azar Bulletin_. Afterwards in the _Tropical\r\nDiseases Bulletin_.\r\n\r\nThe parasite, commonly known as the Leishman-Donovan body, is\r\nintracellular (fig. 50, 2, 3). It is found in the endothelial cells\r\nof the capillaries of the liver, spleen, bone-marrow, lymphatic\r\nglands and intestinal mucosa, and in the macrophages of the spleen\r\nand bone-marrow. Some host cells may contain many parasites. It is\r\nrather rare in the circulating blood, but may be found in the blood\r\nfrom the femoral, portal and hepatic veins. It does not occur in\r\nthe red blood corpuscles as was formerly thought. The parasites\r\nliberated from the endothelial cells are taken up by the mononuclear\r\nand polymorphonuclear leucocytes. The Leishman-Donovan body is the\r\nresting stage of a flagellate. As found in man it is a small, oval\r\norganism, about 2·5 µ to 3·5 µ in length by 2 µ in breadth, and\r\ncontaining two chromatinic bodies, corresponding to the nucleus and\r\nkinetic nucleus (blepharoplast) of a flagellate. The latter element\r\nis the smaller and more deeply staining, and is usually placed at the\r\nperiphery, transversely to the longer axis of the oval organism.\r\nThere is sometimes a very short, slightly curved filament to be seen,\r\nwhich may be a rhizoplast. Multiplication takes place by binary or\r\nmultiple fission. The presence of the parasite used to be demonstrated\r\nby splenic or hepatic puncture; nowadays it can be demonstrated in\r\nperipheral blood, _e.g._, of the finger, or by culture of infected\r\nblood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.--_Leishmania donovani_. _1_, Free forms,\r\neach with nucleus and rod-shaped blepharoplast (after Christophers);\r\n_2_, endothelial cell and leucocytes containing parasites (after\r\nChristophers); _3_, capillary in the liver showing endothelial cells\r\ncontaining parasites (after Christophers); _4_, two parasites escaping\r\nfrom a leucocyte in the alimentary canal of the bug (after Patton);\r\n_5_, further development in bug (after Patton); _6_, young flagellate\r\nforms in bug (after Patton); _7_-_11_, culture forms (after Leishman);\r\n_7_, _8_, _9_, show development of flagellum.]\r\n\r\n_L. donovani_ can be cultivated in citrated splenic blood, under\r\naerobic conditions, at 22° to 25° C. This was first accomplished by\r\nRogers (1904). It is not so easily culturable as _L. infantum_ on the\r\nNovy-MacNeal-Nicolle medium.[124] _L. donovani_ is inoculable with\r\nsome difficulty into experimental animals--in India, white rats, white\r\nmice, dogs and monkeys (_Macacus spp._), have been inoculated. The\r\nSudan variety, somewhat less virulent, is inoculable to monkeys. Row\r\nalso produced a local lesion in _Macacus sinicus_ by subcutaneous\r\ninoculation of _L. donovani_. Parasites taken from such a local lesion\r\nwere found to be capable of producing a generalised infection in\r\n_Macacus sinicus_ and white mice.\r\n\r\n[124] For the composition of this medium, see Appendix.\r\n\r\nIn cultures the various species of _Leishmania_ all grow into\r\nherpetomonad, uniflagellate organisms (fig. 50, 10), about 12 µ to\r\n20 µ in body length. On this account Rogers[125] and Patton place the\r\nLeishman-Donovan body within the genus _Herpetomonas_. The method of\r\nculture may be used in diagnosing leishmaniases.\r\n\r\n[125] _Proc. Roy. Soc._, B, lxxvii, p. 284.\r\n\r\nKala-azar is very probably an insect-borne disease. Patton[126]\r\nsuspects the bed-bug to be the transmitter and finds (fig. 50, _4_-_6_)\r\nthat the Leishman-Donovan body can develop into the flagellate stage\r\nin the digestive tract of the bed-bug. Feeding experiments are\r\nunsatisfactory, since there are very few cases in which the parasites\r\noccur in sufficient numbers in the peripheral blood to make the\r\ninfection of the insect possible, or at any rate easy. In examining\r\nthe alimentary tracts of insects for possible flagellate stages of\r\n_Leishmania_, it must be remembered that in many insects natural\r\nflagellate parasites, belonging to the genus _Herpetomonas_, may occur\r\ntherein; such natural insect flagellates may be harmless, and have no\r\nconnection with the life-cycle of _L. donovani_. Natural herpetomonads\r\nare known to occur in the alimentary tracts of flies, mosquitoes,\r\nsand-flies, fleas and lice, but not in bed-bugs. Further, if such\r\nflagellates are able to be inoculated into and live within vertebrate\r\nhosts, producing symptoms like those of leishmaniasis, the origin of\r\nkala-azar is indicated (see pp. 104, 112).\r\n\r\n[126] _Sci. Mem. Govt. India_, Nos. 27, 31 (1907–08).\r\n\r\n\r\n*Leishmania tropica*, Wright, 1903.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Helcosoma tropicum_, Wright, 1903; _L. wrighti_, Nicolle,\r\n  1908; _Ovoplasma orientale_, Marzinowsky and Bogrow.\r\n\r\n  It is believed by some that the parasite was first described by\r\n  Cunningham in 1885, and studied by Firth in 1891, being called by\r\n  him _Sporozoon furunculosum_. If these earlier studies were of the\r\n  parasite, then its correct name is _L. furunculosa_, Firth, 1891.\r\n\r\nThe benign disease produced by this parasite has received many names,\r\namong the best known being Oriental sore, Tropical sore, Delhi boil and\r\nAleppo button. These names, however, are not happy ones, as cutaneous\r\nleishmaniasis (_e.g._, on the ear) is now known to occur in the New\r\nWorld, for example in Mexico, Venezuela, Brazil and neighbouring\r\nStates. However, it may be necessary to subdivide cutaneous\r\nleishmaniases later.\r\n\r\nIn the Old World the disease occurs in India, Persia, Arabia and\r\nTranscaucasia. It is also known in Algeria, Northern Nigeria, Egypt,\r\nSudan, Crete, Calabria, Sicily and Greece.\r\n\r\nThe boils often occur on the face, and before ulceration the parasites\r\nmay be found in the cells at the margin and floor of the “button.” In\r\nsearching for parasites the scab should be removed and scrapings made\r\nfrom the floor and edges. Where lesions occur atrophy of the epidermis\r\ntakes place, and infiltration of mononuclear cells (_e.g._, plasma\r\ncells, lymphoid and endothelial cells) follows. The parasites are\r\nintracellular, being found inside mononuclear cells. In non-ulcerating\r\nsores, Cardamitis found some free parasites. Non-ulcerating forms\r\nare said to occur in the Sudan. In the Old World the sores are often\r\nlimited to exposed surfaces of the body. Infection of mucous membranes\r\n(such as the lip, palate, buccal and nasal membranes) may occur,\r\nespecially in South America, and are often known there as “Espundia.”\r\nChristopherson (1914) has recorded a case in Khartoum.\r\n\r\n_Leishmania tropica_ is equally well cultivated on Novy-MacNeal-Nicolle\r\nmedium or on citrated blood. The usual temperature for cultivation\r\nis 22° to 28° C., though Marzinowski claims to have cultivated the\r\nparasite at 37° C. _L. tropica_ can be inoculated into monkeys and\r\ndogs, with the production of local lesions. Material from a human sore\r\nor flagellates from a culture may be thus successfully inoculated. Also\r\ninfected material may be rubbed directly into a scarified surface. The\r\nincubation period is long, extending over several months. The duration\r\nof the disease may be from twelve to eighteen months. Recovery from\r\none attack of tropical sore confers immunity, and the Jews in Bagdad\r\ninoculate their children with the disease on a part of the body which\r\nwill be covered, and so secure immunity in adult life.\r\n\r\nThe mode of transmission of _L. tropica_ is unknown. Wenyon (1911)[127]\r\nhas found that the parasite develops into the flagellate stage in the\r\ndigestive tract of _Stegomyia fasciata_ in Bagdad. Patton (1912)[128]\r\nhas found similar development in the bed-bug in Cambay. The house-fly,\r\n_Phlebotomus_ and _Simulium_ have been suspected as transmitters in\r\ndifferent parts of the world.\r\n\r\n[127] _Parasitology_, iv, p. 387.\r\n\r\n[128] _Sci. Mem. Govt. India_, No. 50.\r\n\r\nAn interesting announcement has been made recently (May, 1913), that\r\nNeligan has found that _L. tropica_ occurs in dogs in Teheran, Persia,\r\nproducing ulcers on the dogs’ faces (_cf._ natural occurrence of _L.\r\ninfantum_ in dogs--see p. 110). Yakimoff and Schokhor (1914),[129] have\r\nfound the disease in dogs in Tashkent.\r\n\r\n[129] _Bull. Soc. Path. Exot._, vii, p. 186.\r\n\r\nGonder[130] (1913) has performed some interesting experiments showing\r\nthe relation of infantile kala-azar to Oriental sore. Gonder infected\r\nmice with _L. infantum_ and with _L. tropica_. He used culture material\r\nand injected intraperitoneally or intravenously. In each a general\r\ninfection resulted, with enlargement of the liver and spleen. Later,\r\nhowever, mice injected with Oriental sore (North African variety)\r\ndeveloped peripheral lesions on the feet, tail and head, and the\r\nlesions contained _Leishmania_. No such peripheral lesions developed\r\nin the case of the mice infected with the kala-azar virus. Gonder\r\nsuggested that Oriental sore, like kala-azar, is really a general\r\ninfection overlooked in its earlier stages, and that it is in the\r\nlater stages that peripheral lesions on the skin are developed. Row\r\n(1914)[131] also obtained a general infection in a mouse by the\r\ninjection of cultures of _L. tropica_ from Oriental sore of Cambay.\r\n\r\n[130] _Arch. f. Schiffs- u. Trop. Hyg._, xvii, p. 397.\r\n\r\n[131] _Bull. Soc. Path. Exot._, vii, p. 272.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Leishmania infantum*, Nicolle, 1908.[132]\r\n\r\nInfantile splenic anæmia has been long known in Italy. It also\r\noccurs in Algeria, Tunis, Tripoli, Syria, Greece, Turkey, Crete,\r\nSicily, Malta,[133] Spain and Portugal. This leishmaniasis is, then,\r\ndistributed along the Mediterranean littoral; also in Russia. Cathoire\r\n(1904) in Tunis and Pianese (1905) in Italy were among the first to see\r\nthe parasite. Nicolle then found the parasite in patients in Tunis, and\r\nfurther found spontaneous infection in dogs. The patients are usually\r\nchildren between the ages of 2 and 5 years. There are a few cases known\r\nin which the infantile type of leishmaniasis occurred in youths and\r\nadults of the ages of 17 to 19, while one patient in Calabria was 38\r\nyears old. The symptoms are like those of Indian kala-azar. Several\r\nItalian investigators and others consider that _L. infantum_ is the\r\nsame as _L. donovani_, and that the latter name should be used for the\r\nparasite of Mediterranean leishmaniasis. This view, as to the identity\r\nof _L. donovani_ and _L. infantum_, seems coming into general favour.\r\n\r\n[132] _Arch. Inst. Pasteur Tunis_, i, p. 26.\r\n\r\n[133] _See_ Wenyon (1914), _Trans. Soc. Trop. Med. and Hyg._, vii,\r\np. 97; also Critien (1911), _Annals Trop. Med. and Parasitol._, v,\r\np. 37.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, differences between the Indian and infantile\r\nkala-azars, in addition to the ages of the patients affected,\r\nthus: (_a_) As regards cultures, it is found that _L. infantum_ is\r\nreadily grown on the Novy-MacNeal-Nicolle (“N.N.N.”) medium (saline\r\nblood-agar), and that sub-cultures are easily obtained; in citrated\r\nblood _L. infantum_ grows with difficulty. The reverse is the case with\r\nregard to culture media for _L. donovani_, which grows with difficulty\r\non the N.N.N. medium, but relatively easily in citrated splenic blood.\r\n(_b_) Considering inoculability into experimental animals, it is found\r\nthat _L. donovani_ is inoculated generally with some difficulty into\r\nwhite rats, white mice and monkeys, and with greater difficulty into\r\ndogs, while _L. infantum_ can be inoculated into several experimental\r\nanimals, especially into dogs and monkeys, with ease. (_c_) At present\r\n_L. donovani_ is not known to occur spontaneously in animals, but _L.\r\ninfantum_ is found naturally in dogs in the Mediterranean region, and\r\nthe disease in dogs is often referred to as canine kala-azar. Kittens\r\nhave occasionally been found infected. However, these differences must\r\nnot be emphasized too much.\r\n\r\nThe material for cultivation is obtained from punctures of spleen,\r\nliver or bone-marrow of cases infected with _L. infantum_. It is\r\nnot always easy, however, to infect from cultures, as the cultural\r\nflagellates inoculated into the body are often phagocytosed.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the material for animal inoculation is obtained from\r\nemulsions of infected spleen, liver or bone-marrow. Dogs and monkeys\r\nare easily inoculated with such material; Nicolle inoculates into the\r\nliver or the peritoneal cavity. Mice, white rats, guinea-pigs and\r\nrabbits only show slight infections after such inoculations.\r\n\r\nDogs infected experimentally with infantile leishmaniasis may show\r\neither acute or chronic symptoms. The acute course occurs more often in\r\nyoung dogs, and is usually fatal in three to five months. The chronic\r\ncourse is found more commonly in older dogs, and may last seventeen to\r\neighteen months. In acute forms there is irregular fever, progressive\r\nwasting, diarrhœa occasionally, motor disturbances involving the hind\r\nquarters, and the animal dies in a comatose condition. In the chronic\r\nform the animal may appear well, except for loss of weight. The\r\nparasites may be found in the internal organs of these experimental\r\ndogs, but are not numerous in the peripheral blood except at times of\r\nhigh fever. Experimental monkeys live about three months.\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting to record the number of dogs found to be infected\r\nnaturally with leishmaniasis in various countries. In Tunis, Nicolle\r\nand Yakimoff found about 2 per cent. infected out of about 500 dogs\r\nexamined. Sergent in Algiers found 9 infected out of 125 dogs examined.\r\nIn Italy and Sicily, Basile found about 40 per cent. of the dogs to be\r\ninfected out of 93 examined at Rome and Bordonaro. Cardamitis found\r\n15 infected out of 184 examined in Athens. In Malta, Critien found 3\r\ninfected out of 30 dogs examined. Alvares found 1 infected dog out of\r\n19 examined in Lisbon. Pringault has recently (December, 1913) found\r\nan infected dog in Marseilles.[134] Yakimoff and Schokhor found 24 per\r\ncent. infected out of 647 dogs examined in Turkestan.\r\n\r\n[134] _Bull. Soc. Path. Exot._, vii, p. 41.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the parasites in the body of the human patient is\r\nmuch the same as in the case of Indian kala-azar. Critien records\r\nthe finding of parasites in the mucous flakes of the stools of a\r\nthree-year-old Maltese child.[135] Intestinal lesions rarely occur in\r\ninfantile leishmaniasis.\r\n\r\n[135] Quoted by Leishman (1911) in his interesting review of\r\nLeishmaniasis, _Journ. Roy. Army Med. Corps_, xvii, p. 567, xviii,\r\npp. 1, 125. Also _Quart. Journ. Med._ v, pp. 109–152.\r\n\r\n_Ætiology._--Infantile leishmaniasis is stated to be transmitted\r\nby fleas, especially dog fleas, _Ctenocephalus canis_ (= _Pulex\r\nserraticeps_), and by _Pulex irritans_. Children living in contact with\r\ninfected dogs may be bitten by infected dog fleas, and so contract\r\nthe disease. Basile (1910–11) and Sangiorgi (1910) state that they\r\nfound _L. infantum_ parasites in the digestive tract of the dog flea.\r\nAfter searching they found infected dog fleas on the beds, mattresses,\r\nand pillows used by children suffering from the disease. Franchini\r\n(1912) thinks that _Anopheles maculipennis_ may be concerned in the\r\ntransmission.\r\n\r\nBasile[136] tried a number of experiments to show that infantile\r\nleishmaniasis is transmitted by fleas, thus:--\r\n\r\n[136] Numerous papers in _Rendiconti R. Accad. dei Lincei_ (Rome), xix,\r\nxx (1910–11).\r\n\r\n(1) Fleas were taken from a healthy dog. They were placed in vessels\r\ncontaining infected spleen-pulp and allowed to feed thereon. The fleas\r\nwere then killed and dissected, and portions of the gut-contents\r\nexamined for parasites. The remainder of the gut was emulsified\r\nand injected into a young puppy, whose bone-marrow had been shown\r\npreviously to be uninfected. Basile states that the puppy became\r\ninfected. The parasites are said to increase in number in the flea’s\r\ngut.\r\n\r\n(2) Two healthy pups, each a month old, and born in the laboratory,\r\nwere placed in a disinfected, flea-proof cage. A few days after, an\r\ninfected dog was placed in the cage, so that fleas from the infected\r\ndog could pass on to the puppies. A month later the two pups became\r\ninfected, parasites being found in them after liver puncture. A number\r\nof control puppies from the same litter remained uninfected and in good\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\n(3) Basile next used other laboratory-born puppies, a month old. Four\r\nof the litter were placed in a disinfected, flea-proof gauze cage in\r\nRome. The cage was isolated from other dogs. Fleas obtained from an\r\ninfected area in Sicily were placed in the cage. The puppies were\r\nexamined by hepatic puncture, but were found to be negative for two\r\nmonths. Then two of the puppies showed infection, and six days later\r\nthe remaining two puppies were found to be infected, and all four died.\r\nThey showed irregular temperatures, and were getting thin. Control\r\npuppies remained healthy.\r\n\r\nFrom these experiments Basile concludes that fleas transmit\r\nleishmaniasis. However, Basile did not exclude the possible occurrence\r\nof natural herpetomonads in the gut of the fleas.[137] _Herpetomonas\r\nctenocephali_ is known to occur in the gut of _Ctenocephalus canis_. A\r\nnatural _Herpetomonas_ is also known in the gut of _Pulex irritans_,\r\nas well as a _Crithidia_ (_C. pulicis_, Porter). These natural\r\nflagellates of the fleas pass through non-flagellate stages, like the\r\nLeishman-Donovan body. In consequence Wenyon and Patton, among others,\r\nhave criticized Basile’s results. Further, other investigators, such as\r\nWenyon and Da Silva (1913), have repeated Basile’s flea experiments and\r\nbeen unable to confirm them.\r\n\r\n[137] See Fantham, _Brit. Med. Journ._, 1912, ii, p. 1196.\r\n\r\nIn feeding and inoculation experiments the incubation period of the\r\nparasite may be long, and so it is necessary to wait a long time to see\r\nwhether the parasite will develop.\r\n\r\n_Immunity._--Nicolle has tried some experiments with _L. infantum_ and\r\n_L. tropica_. He finds that in animals recovery from an attack of the\r\nformer confers immunity against infection by the latter and vice-versâ.\r\n\r\nLaveran[138] records that a monkey having an immunity against _L.\r\ninfantum_ was also immune to _L. donovani_.\r\n\r\n[138] _Annales Inst. Pasteur_ (1914–15), xxviii, pp. 823, 885; xxix,\r\npp. 1, 71.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned on p. 103, Laveran and Franchini (1913), working in Paris,\r\nhave succeeded in inoculating _Herpetomonas ctenocephali_, a natural\r\nflagellate in the gut of the flea, _Ctenocephalus canis_, into white\r\nmice. Leishmaniform stages of the flea flagellate were recovered\r\nfrom the peritoneal exudate, blood and organs of the mice some weeks\r\nafter inoculation. The parasites may also be conveyed by way of the\r\ndigestive tract of the vertebrate. Similar experiments have succeeded\r\nwith _H. pattoni_. These experiments go to show, together with those\r\nof Fantham and Porter with _H. jaculum_ (see p. 104), that, in the\r\nwords of the latter authors, “it may be expected that the various\r\nleishmaniases, occurring in different parts of the world, will prove to\r\nbe insect-borne herpetomoniases.”\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Histoplasma*, Darling, 1906.\r\n\r\nUnder the name _Histoplasma capsulatum_,[139] Darling described\r\nsmall round or oval parasites, enclosed in a refractile capsule, and\r\neach containing a single nucleus. The bodies were found in cases of\r\nsplenomegaly in Panama. They occurred in the endothelial cells of\r\nthe small blood-vessels of the liver, spleen, lungs, intestine and\r\nlymphatic glands, and also within the leucocytes. A few flagellates\r\nwere stated to occur in the lungs. The parasite has usually been\r\nplaced near _Leishmania_, but recently Rocha-Lima has stated that\r\n_Histoplasma_ is a yeast.\r\n\r\n[139] _Journ. Amer. Med. Assoc._, xlvi, p. 1283: _Journ. Exptl. Med._\r\n(1909), xi, p. 515.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Toxoplasma*, Nicolle and Manceaux, 1908.\r\n\r\n  The genus was created for crescentic, oval or reniform parasites,\r\n  2·5 µ to 6 µ by 2 µ to 3 µ, possessing a single nucleus and\r\n  multiplying by binary fission. They occur in mononuclear and\r\n  polymorphonuclear cells in the blood, spleen, liver, peritoneum etc.\r\n  (fig. 51). The parasites have been found in the gondi, dog, rabbit,\r\n  mole, mouse, pigeon and other birds. Although various species names\r\n  have been given to the parasites in these hosts, it seems probable,\r\n  from cross infection experiments, that there is but one species with\r\n  several physiological races. Splendore[140] (1913) has described a\r\n  flagellate stage.\r\n\r\n[140] _Bull. Soc. Path. Exot._, vi, p. 318.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.--_Toxoplasma gondii_, endocellular or free in\r\nthe peritoneal exudate of infected mice. 1, 2, mononuclear leucocytes\r\ncontaining toxoplasms. 3, polynuclear, containing parasites. 4, 5,\r\n6, endothelial cells containing toxoplasms, agglomerated in 6. 7,\r\nagglomeration forms. 8–11, free forms. 12–13, division stages. × 1,600.\r\n(After Laveran and Marullaz.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.--_Toxoplasma pyrogenes._ 1, body found in\r\nblood. 2–7, bodies found] in spleen.

The\r\nbodies were found in the spleen and more rarely in the blood (fig. 52).\r\nCastellani has named them _Toxoplasma pyrogenes_. Further researches\r\nare needed.\r\n\r\n[141] _Journ. Trop. Med. and Hyg._, xvii, p. 113.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPIROCHÆTES.\r\n\r\nThe Spirochætes are long, narrow, wavy, thread-like organisms, with\r\na firm yet flexible outer covering or periplast. There is a diffuse\r\nnucleus internally in the form of bars or rodlets of chromatin\r\ndistributed along the body. In some forms there is a membrane or crista\r\npresent (fig. 53), which in the past was compared with the undulating\r\nmembrane of a trypanosome, but the membrane of a spirochæte does not\r\nundulate. Progression is very rapid, corkscrew-like and undulatory\r\nmovements occurring simultaneously.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Spirochæta_ was founded by Ehrenberg in 1833 for an organism\r\nwhich he discovered in stagnant water in Berlin. Ehrenberg named\r\nthe organism _Spirochæta plicatilis_. According to Zuelzer (1912)\r\n_S. plicatilis_ does not possess a membrane or crista, but an axial\r\nfilament. _S. gigantea_ has been described by Warming from sea-water.\r\n\r\nSpirochætes occur in the crystalline style and digestive tract of many\r\nbivalve molluscs. The first molluscan spirochæte to be studied was\r\nthat of the oyster, named by Certes (1882) “_Trypanosoma_” _balbianii_\r\n(fig. 53). Similar spirochætes, probably belonging to the same species,\r\noccur in various species of _Tapes_ and in _Pecten_ (the scallop).\r\n_S. balbianii_ has rounded ends (fig. 53). Other spirochætes occur\r\nin freshwater mussels (_Anodonta_ spp). _S. anodontæ_, studied by\r\nKeysselitz (1906) and by Fantham (1907), has pointed ends. Gross (1911)\r\nsuggested the generic name _Cristispira_ for molluscan spirochætes,\r\nbecause they possess a well-marked membrane or “crista,” which appears\r\nto be absent from _S. plicatilis_, according to Zuelzer’s researches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.--_Spirochæta balbianii._ _a_, basal granule\r\nor polar cap. _b_, chromatin rodlets. _c_, membrane (“crista”). _d_,\r\nmyonemes in membrane. (After Fantham and Porter.)]\r\n\r\nSchaudinn in 1905 founded the genus _Treponema_ for the parasite of\r\nsyphilis (_T. pallidum_), discovered by him and by Hoffmann. According\r\nto Schaudinn the Treponemata have no membrane or crista. The pathogenic\r\nagent of yaws or frambœsia, discovered by Castellani, is also placed in\r\nthe genus _Treponema_, as _T. pertenue_.\r\n\r\nThere remain the blood spirochætes. It is somewhat disputed as to\r\nwhether these organisms possess a membrane. The present writer\r\nconsiders that they have a slight membrane or crista. The name of\r\nthe genus in which to place the blood-inhabiting forms is somewhat\r\nuncertain and disputed. Various generic names given to them are\r\n_Spirochæta_, _Treponema_, _Spiroschaudinnia_ (Sambon) and _Borrelia_\r\n(Swellengrebel). Included in this division are the causal agents\r\nof relapsing or recurrent fever. These Protists will be named, for\r\ndescription, Spirochætes without prejudice as to the ultimate correct\r\ngeneric name.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes made a matter of argument as to whether the spirochætes\r\nare Protozoa or Bacteria. Such arguments are somewhat unprofitable.\r\nMorphologically the spirochætes are like the Bacteria in possessing a\r\ndiffuse nucleus. They differ from _Spirillum_, an undoubted bacterial\r\ngenus, in being flexible and not possessing flagella. Molluscan\r\nspirochætes, however, may appear to have flagella if their membrane\r\nbecomes frayed or ruptured, when the myonemes therein (fig. 53),\r\nbecoming separated, form apparent threads or flagella (Fantham,\r\n1907–08).[142]\r\n\r\n[142] _Quart. Journ. Microsc. Sci._, lii, p. 1.\r\n\r\nAgain, the mode of division of spirochætes has been used as a criterion\r\nof their bacterial or protozoal affinity. They have been stated to\r\ndivide transversely, longitudinally, and by “incurvation,” or bending\r\non themselves in the form of a *U*, “a form of transverse fission.”\r\nThe present writer believes that they divide both transversely and\r\nlongitudinally, and that there is a periodicity in their mode of\r\ndivision at first longitudinal (when there are few spirochætes in, say,\r\nthe blood) and then transversely (when spirochætes are numerous in\r\nthe blood).[143] Some authors consider that longitudinal division is\r\nexplained by “incurvation.”\r\n\r\n[143] _Proc. Roy. Soc._, B, lxxxi, p. 500.\r\n\r\nThe spirochætes of relapsing fever show a remarkable periodic increase\r\nand decrease in numbers in the blood. They are transmitted by ticks\r\nor by lice. They react to drugs (_e.g._, salvarsan or “606”) rather\r\nlike trypanosomes, and--like Protozoa, but unlike Bacteria--they\r\nare cultivated with difficulty. These and other criteria have\r\nbeen used to endeavour to determine whether they are Protozoa or\r\nBacteria. The present writer believes that they are intermediate in\r\ncharacter, showing morphological affinities with the Bacteria and\r\nphysiological and therapeutical affinities with the Protozoa. The group\r\nSpirochætacea, as an appendix to the Protozoa, has been created for\r\nthem by the present writer (Jan., 1908). Others have placed them in the\r\nSpirochætoidea of the Bacteria or with the Spirillacea. Doflein (1909)\r\ncalled them Proflagellata. Further discussion is unnecessary, as they\r\nare undoubtedly Protista (see p. 29).\r\n\r\nThere is no true conjugation, sex or encystment in spirochætes, but\r\nmorphological variation may occur.[144] They may agglomerate.\r\n\r\n[144] Fantham, _Parasitology_, ii, p. 392.\r\n\r\nThe Spirochætes form an interesting chapter in the evolution of\r\nparasites. There are free living forms, parasitic forms in the guts\r\nof both vertebrates and invertebrates, and blood-inhabiting forms.\r\nThese probably represent the order of evolution of parasitism. The\r\nblood-inhabiting forms are pathogenic to warm-blooded hosts.\r\n\r\nWe must now consider the blood Spirochætes and the Treponemata\r\n(organisms of syphilis and of yaws).\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPIROCHÆTES OF THE BLOOD.\r\n\r\nThere are at least two important human parasites included hereunder:--\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Spirochæta recurrentis_ (=_S. obermeieri_), (_b_) _Spirochæta\r\nduttoni_.\r\n\r\nMore is known of the life-cycle of _Spirochæta duttoni_, and it will be\r\nconvenient to consider that first.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Spirochæta duttoni*, Novy and Knapp, 1906.\r\n\r\n  The specific name _duttoni_ was also given, independently, to this\r\n  parasite in 1906 by Breinl and Kinghorn.\r\n\r\n_S. duttoni_ is the pathogenic agent of African tick fever in man,\r\nprevalent in the Congo State and other parts of Africa. The full-grown\r\norganism is about 16 µ to 24 µ long, and has pointed ends. It is 0·25 µ\r\nto 0·5 µ broad. P. H. Ross and Nabarro were among the earliest to see a\r\nspirochæte in the blood of patients in Uganda. It is transmitted by the\r\ntick, _Ornithodorus moubata_.\r\n\r\nIn the blood of the patient some of the spirochætes may show, after\r\nstaining, lighter and darker portions (chromatin dots) and evidence\r\nof the possession of a very narrow membrane (fig. 54). The mode of\r\ndivision has already been discussed. Periodicity in the direction\r\nof division was first described by Fantham and Porter,[145] (1909).\r\nJust before the crisis in African tick fever, Breinl has stated that\r\n_S. duttoni_ becomes thinner in the spleen and bone-marrow and rolls\r\nup into skein-like forms, which are surrounded by a thin “cyst” wall\r\n(probably the periplast). Such occur in apyrexial periods. Inside\r\nthe cyst the spirochæte breaks up into granules. Balfour and Sambon\r\nhave described somewhat similar rolled up forms, breaking into\r\ngranules, inside the red blood cells of Sudanese fowls in the case\r\nof _S. granulosa_ (possibly only a variety of _S. gallinarum_). The\r\nintracorpuscular stage is not definitely established.\r\n\r\n[145] _Proc. Roy. Soc._, B, lxxxi, p. 500.\r\n\r\nThe granule phase, however, is an essential one in the invertebrate\r\ntransmitter (fig. 54_c_). In 1905,[146] Dutton and Todd proved\r\nexperimentally that _O. moubata_ transmitted _S. duttoni_. They fed\r\nticks, obtained from Congo native huts in which infected persons\r\nlived, on monkeys and the latter became infected. Dutton and Todd also\r\nfound the offspring of infected ticks to be capable of transmitting the\r\ninfection to experimental animals. They concluded that _O. moubata_ was\r\na true intermediate host.\r\n\r\n[146] _Liverpool Sch. Trop. Med._, _Memoir_ xvii; _Lancet_, Nov. 30,\r\n1907, p. 1523.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.--_Spirochæta duttoni_. _a_, blood form showing\r\nslight membrane; _b_, granules or coccoid bodies clearly formed within\r\nthe organism; _c_, beginning of extrusion of coccoid bodies in the\r\ntick. (After Fantham.)]\r\n\r\nA little later in 1905, Koch stated that spirochætes from the gut of\r\nthe tick penetrated the gut wall and tissues and found their way into\r\nthe eggs in the ovary. Koch figured tangled masses of spirochætes as\r\noccurring in the tick eggs. He found ticks infective to the third\r\ngeneration. He thought that the infection was spread by the salivary\r\nfluid of the tick, in the act of biting. (This is now known to be\r\nincorrect.) Markham Carter (1907) corroborated Koch’s work on the\r\nspirochætes in the tick eggs, and they have been seen since by Kleine\r\nand Eckard (1913).\r\n\r\nSir William Leishman,[147] in 1909–10, found that at ordinary\r\ntemperatures the salivary glands of infected ticks (_O. moubata_) were\r\nnot themselves infective, and that the infection occurred by way of the\r\nticks’ excretion. The spirochætes (contained in the ticks’ excrement)\r\nfound their way into the vertebrate host through the wound made by\r\nbiting. While feeding, ticks pass large quantities of clear fluid from\r\nthe coxal glands; in this fluid an anticoagulin occurs. Some of the\r\nticks also pass thick, white Malpighian secretion, that is, excrement,\r\ntowards the end of the feed. Leishman, using experimental monkeys,\r\nshowed that if infected ticks were interrupted while feeding, then no\r\ninfection resulted in the monkeys. If, however, the ticks were allowed\r\nto finish their feed, and the Malpighian secretions were passed, then\r\nthe experimental monkeys became infected. Fantham[148] and Hindle[149]\r\n(1911), independently, have repeated the experiments with mice.\r\n\r\n[147] _Journ. Roy. Army Med. Corps_, xii, p. 123; _Lancet_ (1910),\r\nclxxviii, p. 11.\r\n\r\n[148] _Annals Trop. Med. and Parasitol._, v, p. 479.\r\n\r\n[149] _Parasitology_, iv, p. 133.\r\n\r\nLeishman’s methods and results may be summarized thus: Saline emulsions\r\nof the organs of infected ticks were made, after the organs had been\r\nmost carefully dissected out. The ticks were first kept for several\r\ndays at certain constant temperatures, such as 24° to 25° C. or blood\r\nheat, 37° C. The saline emulsions of the organs were inoculated,\r\nseparately, into experimental animals, and the results recorded:--\r\n\r\n                       At 24° C.     At 37° C.\r\n  Salivary glands      Negative      Positive\r\n  Malpighian tubules   Positive      Positive\r\n  Gut and contents     Positive      Positive\r\n  Excrement            Positive      Positive\r\n  Genital organs       Positive      Positive\r\n\r\nCoxal fluid is usually negative; thick, white excrement from Malpighian\r\ntubes is positive.\r\n\r\nWhen the ticks were incubated at 21° to 24° C. no spirochætes, as such,\r\nwere seen in the organs, except perhaps in the gut, where they often\r\ndisappeared in a few days. When the ticks were previously incubated at\r\n35° to 37° C. for two to three days, spirochætes, as such, reappear in\r\nthe gut, organs and hæmocœlic fluid. The infection proceeds, not from\r\nthe salivary gland, but from the infective excrement, that is, from the\r\nthick, white material voided by the tick while feeding, usually towards\r\nthe end of the meal. This Malpighian excrement passes into the wound\r\ncaused by the bite, being greatly aided by the clear and more limpid\r\ncoxa fluid, which bathes the under surface of the tick’s body, and\r\nmixes with and carries the infective excrement into the wound. Ticks\r\nremain infective for a long time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.--_Spirochæta duttoni_ and its coccoid bodies\r\nin the tick (_O. moubata_).--Mononuclear cells of the tick (_O.\r\nmoubata_) containing (_a_) Spirochæte breaking up into coccoid bodies;\r\n(_b_) Similar tick-cell containing coccoid bodies or granules. Such\r\nmononuclear cells occur in various organs of ticks and in developing\r\nMalpighian tubules. (Original. From preparations by Fantham.)]\r\n\r\nThe spirochætes in the gut of infected ticks divide by a process\r\nof multiple transverse fission into granules, which are composed\r\nof chromatin (fig. 54). These granules--sometimes known as coccoid\r\nbodies--are capable of multiplication. Leishman first found them in\r\nclumps inside the cells of the Malpighian tubules (_cf._ fig. 55).\r\n\r\nTo summarize, when spirochætes are ingested by a tick, some of them\r\npass through the gut-wall into the hæmocœlic (body) fluid. They then\r\nbore their way into the cells of various organs (fig. 55_a_) and break\r\nup into coccoid bodies. In this manner the granules find their way\r\ninto the ovaries and ova, thus explaining how the young ticks are born\r\ninfected. Inoculation of these chromatinic granules usually produces\r\ninfection. Infective granules are also seen in the rudiments of the\r\nMalpighian tubules of embryo ticks. Bosanquet and Fantham (1911),\r\nindependently, have shown that molluscan spirochætes also break up\r\ninto similar granules or coccoid bodies. Gross has also demonstrated\r\nmultiple transverse fission in molluscan forms. Marchoux and Couvy\r\n(1913) and Wolbach (1914) consider the granules or coccoid bodies to be\r\ndegeneration products. This is unlikely (see below).\r\n\r\nSchuberg and Manteufel have found that certain _O. moubata_, perhaps\r\n30 per cent. of the specimens of a given neighbourhood, may acquire a\r\nnatural active immunity against infection with _S. duttoni_.\r\n\r\n_S. duttoni_, or a closely allied form (by some termed _S. novyi_),\r\noccurs in Colombia, and is spread by the tick _Ornithodorus turicata_.\r\nIn Panama a similar spirochæte is probably spread by _O. talaje_.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Spirochæta gallinarum*, Stephens and Christophers, 1905 (= *Spirochæta\r\nmarchouxi*, Nuttall, 1905).\r\n\r\nThis Spirochæte, which occurs in fowls and is pathogenic, is\r\ntransmitted by the tick _Argas persicus_. It is about 10 µ to 20 µ\r\nlong. There is a pathogenic spirochæte known to occur in geese, named\r\nby Sakharoff (1891) _S. anserina_, and found in Caucasia. This may be\r\nthe same as _S. gallinarum_, in which case the name _S. anserina_ will\r\nhave priority. These organisms cause fever, diarrhœa, anæmia and death.\r\nThe life history of the avian pathogenic spirochætes has been studied\r\nby Balfour, by Hindle[150] and by Fantham.[151] It is essentially\r\nsimilar to that of _S. duttoni_.\r\n\r\n[150] _Parasitology_, iv, p. 463.\r\n\r\n[151] _Annals Trop. Med. and Parasitol._ (1911), v, p. 479.\r\n\r\nMarchoux and Couvy[152] (1913) consider that the “fragmentation of\r\nthe chromatin” in spirochætes is a process of degeneration. Working\r\nwith _A. persicus_ and _S. gallinarum_, they state that a large number\r\nof the spirochætes ingested by the Argas almost immediately pass\r\nthrough the wall of the alimentary canal and appear in the hæmocœlic\r\nfluid. Marchoux and Couvy consider that Leishman’s granules may be\r\nfound in the Malpighian tubules of various Arachnids. They found\r\nspirochætes in the cephalic glands of infected Argas. They consider\r\nthat spirochætes remain as wavy spirochætes within the tick, if they\r\nare to be infective, though the spirochætes may become so thin as to\r\nbe invisible! The latter argument is obviously weak, and it was never\r\nasserted that all granules in the Malpighian tubules of infected ticks\r\nwere derived from spirochætes. With dark-ground illumination small,\r\nrefractile spirochætal granules may be seen to grow into spirochætes.\r\nThe granule phase of spirochætes has recently been discussed by\r\nFantham[153] (1914).\r\n\r\n[152] _Annales Inst. Pasteur_, xxvii, pp. 450, 620.\r\n\r\n[153] _Annals Trop. Med. and Parasitol._, viii, p. 471.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Spirochæta recurrentis*, Lebert, 1874.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Spirochæta obermeieri_, Cohn, 1875.\r\n\r\nThis organism was discovered by Obermeier (1873) in cases of relapsing\r\nfever in Berlin. Short forms 7 µ to 9 µ long, and longer (probably\r\nadult) forms, 16 µ to 19 µ, are found in the blood. The width is\r\n0·25 µ. Parasites 12 µ or 13 µ long are often observed.\r\n\r\nThe spirochæte is found in the blood during febrile attacks and\r\nrelapses, but not during intervening periods. It can be inoculated\r\ninto monkeys, rats and mice. It can live in the bed-bug, _Cimex\r\nlectularius_, and Nuttall has succeeded in transmitting _S.\r\nrecurrentis_ from mouse to mouse by the bites of the same bug. The\r\nFrench investigators Sergent and Foley (1908–9) in Algeria, and\r\nNicolle, Blaizot and Conseil (1912) in Tunis, have shown experimentally\r\nthat _S. recurrentis_ (var. _berbera_) is transmitted by lice. The\r\nlatter workers also demonstrated the method of infection that commonly\r\noccurs, namely, by the scratching of the skin and crushing of lice\r\ncontaining spirochætes on the excoriated surface of the body.\r\n\r\n  Lice as transmitting agents for relapsing fever were indicated\r\n  by Mackie[154] in 1907. An epidemic among Indian school children\r\n  furnished the materials.[155] It was noted that out of 170 boys, 137\r\n  were infected, and the boys were very verminous. Among the girls, 35\r\n  out of 114 suffered, and few lice were found on them. Twenty-four\r\n  per cent. of the lice taken from the boys contained spirochætes as\r\n  compared with 3 per cent. of those from the girls. As the epidemic\r\n  died out among the boys, the lice also became fewer, and an increase\r\n  in the number of cases among the girls coincided with an increase in\r\n  the number of lice. Spirochætes were found in the gut, Malpighian\r\n  tubules and genital organs of the lice. Mackie thought that infection\r\n  of the patients was brought about by the regurgitation of the\r\n  spirochætes when the lice fed, but proof of this was lacking.\r\n\r\n[154] _Brit. Med. Journ._, Dec. 14, 1907, p. 1706.\r\n\r\n[155] See also Nuttall, Herter Lecture on Spirochætosis,\r\n_Parasitology_, v, p. 269.\r\n\r\nIn 1912, Nicolle, Blaizot and Conseil,[156] working in Tunis and using\r\nchiefly an Algerian strain of relapsing fever spirochætes (sometimes\r\ncalled _S. berbera_), showed by direct experiments that infection by\r\nmeans of the bites of _Pediculus vestimenti_ and _P. capitis_ was\r\nuntenable. As many as 4,707 infected lice were fed on one man, and\r\n6,515 on another occasion were allowed to bite a man after they had\r\nfed on a monkey heavily infected with spirochætes, yet no infection of\r\nthe man followed. Examination of the lice showed that the spirochætes\r\nleft the gut soon after they were ingested, and passed into the body\r\ncavity, which swarmed with spirochætes. The contents of the alimentary\r\ntract and the fæces of the lice alike were uninfective. The spirochætes\r\ndid not reappear in the gut till eight days after an infective feed,\r\nbut some persisted as late as the nineteenth day when kept at 28° C.\r\n\r\n[156] _C.R. Acad. Sci._, cliv, p. 1636; clv, p. 481.\r\n\r\nIt was noted that the irritation due to the lice caused scratching,\r\nand that thereby lice became crushed on to the skin. An emulsion was\r\nmade of two infected lice and rubbed on to the slightly excoriated\r\nskin of one of the above workers. Infection followed five days later.\r\nA drop of emulsion placed on the conjunctiva of the human eye produced\r\nspirochætosis after an incubation of seven days. The body contents of\r\nsuch lice, then, produce infection when they reach the blood by any\r\nexcoriated or penetrable surface. The stages leading up to infection\r\nin nature briefly are: The irritation due to the louse bites causes\r\nscratching, and the lice are crushed on to the skin. The slight\r\nabrasion is quite sufficient to permit the entry of the parasite. The\r\nlouse bite alone is harmless. Infection by way of the eye is quite\r\nprobable in Africa, remembering the constant trouble due to sand, dust,\r\ninsects, etc., resulting in frequent touching of the eyes.\r\n\r\nThe spirochætes occur in the body fluid of the lice and can pass in\r\nit to the adjacent organs. Thus they probably find their way into\r\nthe genital organs, and into the eggs of the lice. Eggs laid twenty\r\nto thirty days after the parent became infected have retained the\r\ninfection, and the larvæ issuing from such eggs must have contained\r\nsome form of spirochætes, for an emulsion of either the eggs or the\r\nlarvæ produced spirochætosis when inoculated into monkeys. Further\r\ndetails regarding the spirochætosis in the eggs of the lice and\r\nin the larvæ are needed. Hereditary infection, however, has been\r\ndemonstrated, but is not very common. Sergent and Foley (1914) state\r\nthat the spirochæte possesses a very small and virulent form which it\r\nassumes during apyrexial periods in man and during a period following\r\nan infecting meal in the louse. Nicolle and Blanc (1914) find that\r\nthe organisms are infective in the louse just before they reappear\r\nas spirochætes. Nicolle and Blaizot found that female lice were more\r\nsusceptible to spirochætes than males, four times as many females as\r\nmales being infected.\r\n\r\n  Tictin (1897) found _S. recurrentis_ in bugs recently fed on\r\n  patients, and infected a monkey with the fluids of crushed bugs.\r\n  Karlinski (1902) found the spirochætes in bed-bugs in infected\r\n  houses. There is some other evidence to show that bugs may transmit\r\n  the spirochæte in Nature. Further researches are needed regarding the\r\n  relationship of bed-bugs and human spirochætosis.\r\n\r\nMultiplication of _S. recurrentis_ is by longitudinal and transverse\r\ndivision (including so-called “incurvation”), and the organism forms\r\nsmall, ovoid bodies (“coccoid” bodies) in the same way as _S. duttoni_.\r\n\r\n_S. recurrentis_ is the cause of European relapsing fever, and a number\r\nof possible varieties of it are associated with relapsing fevers in\r\nother parts of the world. Such spirochætes only differ by biological\r\nreactions, such as acquired immunity tests. They include:--\r\n\r\n_S. rossii_, the agent of East African relapsing fever; _S. novyi_, the\r\nagent of North American relapsing fever; _S. carteri_, the agent of\r\nIndian relapsing fever; _S. berbera_, the agent of North African and\r\nEgyptian relapsing fever.\r\n\r\nOTHER HUMAN SPIROCHÆTES are:--\r\n\r\n_S. schaudinni._ This organism, according to Prowazek, is the agent of\r\nulcus tropicum. It varies in length from 10 µ to 20 µ.\r\n\r\n_S. aboriginalis_ has been found in cases of granuloma inguinale in\r\nBritish New Guinea and Western Australia. It also occurs in dogs, and\r\nmay not be truly parasitic.\r\n\r\n_S. vincenti._ This spirochæte is 12 µ to 25 µ in length, tapers\r\nat both ends and has few coils. It has been associated with angina\r\nvincenti. It often occurs in company with fusiform bacilli.\r\n\r\n_S. bronchialis_, found by Castellani in 1907 in cases of bronchitis in\r\nCeylon. The parasites are delicate, but show morphological variation.\r\nThis organism is important and has since been found in the West Indies,\r\nIndia, Philippine Islands and various parts of Africa, such as the\r\nAnglo-Egyptian Sudan, Uganda and West Africa. It has recently been the\r\nsubject of research by Chalmers and O’Farrell, Taylor, and Fantham.\r\n\r\n_S. phagedenis_ was found by Noguchi in a ten days old ulcerated\r\nswelling of the labium. The organism shows much variation in size,\r\nbeing 4 µ to 30 µ in length.\r\n\r\n_S. refringens_ (Schaudinn, 1905) occurs in association with _Treponema\r\npallidum_ in syphilitic lesions, but is non-pathogenic. It is 20 µ to\r\n35 µ long and 0·5 µ to 0·75 µ broad, being larger than _T. pallidum_\r\nand more easily stained.\r\n\r\nVarious spirochætes have also been notified in vomits, chiefly in\r\nAustralia; others from the human intestinal tract, _e.g._, _S.\r\neurygyrata_; _S. stenogyrata_ (Werner); _S. hachaizæ_ (Kowalski), in\r\ncholera motions; _S. buccalis_ (Cohn, 1875) and _S. dentium_ occurring\r\nin the human mouth and in carious teeth (_S. dentium_, Koch, 1877,\r\nbeing the smaller); _S. acuminata_ and _S. obtusa_ found by Castellani\r\nin open sores in cases of yaws.\r\n\r\nAnimal spirochætes of economic importance include:--\r\n\r\n_S. anserina_, highly pathogenic to geese.\r\n\r\n_S. gallinarum_ (= _S. marchouxi_) in fowls. (See p. 119.)\r\n\r\n_S. theileri_ in cattle and _S. ovina_ in sheep also occur in Africa;\r\ntheir pathogenicity is not clear.\r\n\r\n_S. laverani_ (= _S. muris_), occurring in the blood of and pathogenic\r\nto mice, is probably the smallest spirochæte from the blood, being only\r\n3 µ to 6 µ long.\r\n\r\nNumerous spirochætes have been recorded from the guts of various\r\nmammals, birds, fishes, amphibia and insects.\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION OF SPIROCHÆTES.--Cultures of spirochætes have been made\r\nwith little success or with great difficulty until comparatively\r\nrecently, when Noguchi (1912) devised a means whereby he has cultivated\r\nmost of the pathogenic spirochætes as well as some Treponemata.\r\n\r\nNoguchi has now cultivated _S. duttoni_, _S. recurrentis_, _S. rossii_,\r\n_S. novyi_ and _S. gallinarum_ from the blood; _S. phagedenis_[157]\r\nfrom human phagedænic lesions; _S. refringens_[158] and spirochætes\r\nfrom the teeth.\r\n\r\n[157] _Journ. Exptl. Med._, xvi, p. 261.\r\n\r\n[158] _Journ. Exptl. Med._, xv, p. 466.\r\n\r\nHis method is as follows:--\r\n\r\nA piece of fresh, sterile tissue, usually rabbit kidney, is placed in\r\na sterile test-tube. A few drops of citrated blood from the heart of\r\nan infected animal, _e.g._, rat or mouse, is added, and about 15 c.c.\r\nof sterile ascitic or hydrocœle fluid is poured quickly into the tube.\r\nSome of the tubes are covered with a layer of sterile paraffin oil,\r\nothers are left uncovered. The tubes are incubated at 37° C. The best\r\nresults are obtained if the blood is taken from an animal forty-eight\r\nto seventy-two hours after it has been inoculated, that is, before\r\nthe spirochætes reach their maximum multiplicative period in the\r\nblood. The presence of some oxygen seems indispensable for these blood\r\nspirochætes, and they fail to develop _in vacuo_ or in an atmosphere of\r\nhydrogen.\r\n\r\nFor subcultures, 0·5 c.c. of a culture is added to the medium instead\r\nof citrated blood, and it is useful to add a little fresh, normal\r\nblood, either human or from an animal, such as a rat.\r\n\r\nNoguchi found that the events in cultures were:--\r\n\r\n_S. duttoni_,[159] maximum multiplication on the eighth to ninth day;\r\ndisintegration beginning on the tenth day, spirochætes disappeared\r\nafter about the fifteenth day. No diminution of virulence was found at\r\nthe ninth day.\r\n\r\n[159] _Journ. Exptl. Med._, xvi, p. 202.\r\n\r\n_S. rossii_ (= _S. kochi_).[160] Maximum development on the ninth day,\r\nafter which the virulence diminishes. The incubation period is also\r\nprolonged.\r\n\r\n[160] _Ibid._, p. 205.\r\n\r\n_S. recurrentis_[161] (= _S. obermeieri_). Maximum growth on the\r\nseventh day.\r\n\r\n[161] _Ibid._, p. 205.\r\n\r\n_S. novyi._[162]--Maximum development on the seventh day. It is more\r\ndifficult to grow than the preceding forms.\r\n\r\n[162] _Ibid._, p. 208.\r\n\r\nAll the above spirochætes showed undoubted longitudinal division and\r\ntransverse division was observed in part.\r\n\r\n_S. gallinarum_[163] can be cultivated as above, but transverse\r\ndivision was usual here. Maximum growth occurred in the culture about\r\nthe fifth day.\r\n\r\n[163] _Ibid._, p. 620.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREPONEMATA.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Treponema_ (Schaudinn, 1905), includes minute, thread-like\r\norganisms, with spirally coiled bodies, the spirals being preformed\r\nor fixed. No membrane or crista is present, according to Schaudinn,\r\nthough a slight one is said by Blanchard to be present in the\r\norganism of yaws. The ends of the organisms are tapering and pointed.\r\nMultiplication is by longitudinal and transverse division. The most\r\nimportant members of the genus are _T. pallidum_, the agent of\r\nsyphilis, and _T. pertenue_, which is responsible for frambœsia or yaws.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Treponema pallidum*, Schaudinn, 1905.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Spirochæta pallida_.\r\n\r\n_Treponema pallidum_ was first described by Schaudinn and Hoffmann\r\nin 1905 under the name of _Spirochæta pallida_. It has also been\r\ndescribed under the names of _Spironema pallida_, _Microspironema\r\npallida_ and _Trypanosoma luis_. Siegel in 1905 described an organism\r\nwhich he called _Cytorhyctes luis_ and considered to be the agent\r\nof syphilis. Schaudinn reinvestigated Siegel’s work and found _T.\r\npallidum_, which he considered to be the causal agent of the disease,\r\nand pronounced against _Cytorhyctes luis_. It is probable now that\r\nboth workers were correct, for Balfour (1911) has seen the emission\r\nof minute granules or “coccoid” bodies from _T. pallidum_ and these\r\ngranules probably correspond to the _C. luis_ of Siegel. Recently E. H.\r\nRoss, having observed a spirochæte stage in the development of Kurloff\r\nbodies, thinks that _T. pallidum_ is a stage in the life-history of a\r\nLymphocytozoon. MacDonagh has also described a complicated and somewhat\r\nsimilar cycle, but these observations require further study and\r\nconfirmation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.--_Treponema pallidum_. (After Bell, from\r\nCastellani and Chalmers.)]\r\n\r\n_T. pallidum_ varies from 4 µ to 10 µ in length, its average length\r\nbeing 7 µ, while its width is usually about 0·25 µ. Longer individuals\r\nof 16 µ to 20 µ have been recorded. The body has from eight to ten\r\nspiral turns and forms a tapering process at each end (fig. 56). The\r\norganism is most difficult to stain, and its internal structure is\r\nlittle known. It is possibly like that of _Spirochæta duttoni_ or _S.\r\nbalbianii_, as the “granule shedding” observed by Balfour is strongly\r\nsuggestive of the formation of resistant bodies by those spirochætes.\r\nHoffmann (1912) has seen the formation of spores in _T. pallidum_.\r\n\r\nThe Treponemata occur in the primary and secondary sores, but are\r\ndifficult to find in the tertiary eruptions of syphilis. Noguchi and\r\nMoore (1913) and Mott[164] (1913) have demonstrated _T. pallidum_\r\nin the brain in cases of general paralysis of the insane. Marie and\r\nLevaditi (1914), however, consider that the treponeme found in the\r\nbrain in such cases is different from _T. pallidum_.\r\n\r\n[164] _Brit. Med. Journ._, Nov. 15, 1913. p. 1, 271.\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION _of T. pallidum_.--This has been accomplished successfully\r\nby Noguchi,[165] using a modification of his method for spirochæte\r\ncultivation, for _T. pallidum_ is much more difficult to grow than\r\nspirochætes, being a strict anaerobe.\r\n\r\n[165] _Journ. Exptl. Med._, xv, p. 90; xvi, p. 211.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.--Diagram of apparatus for cultivation of\r\n_Treponema pallidum_ by Noguchi’s method. (After Noguchi.)]\r\n\r\nThe apparatus consists of two glass tubes, the upper being connected to\r\nthe lower by a narrower tube passing through a rubber cork (fig. 57).\r\nBoth tubes are carefully sterilized.\r\n\r\nA piece of fresh, sterile rabbit’s kidney is placed in the lower tube,\r\nwhich is filled with ascitic fluid, or ascitic fluid and bouillon\r\nmixture. The tube is inoculated with syphilitic material and corked\r\nby inserting the upper tube. In the bottom of the upper tube a piece\r\nof sterile rabbit’s kidney is placed and syphilitic material poured\r\nover it. A mixture of one part ascitic fluid and two parts of slightly\r\nalkaline agar is then poured over the tissue and allowed to solidify.\r\nWhen solid, a layer of sterile paraffin oil is poured on top of it,\r\nand the top plugged with cotton wool (fig. 57). The whole is then\r\nincubated at 37° C. for two or three weeks. The tissue removes traces\r\nof oxygen from the lower levels of the medium and also probably\r\nprovides a special form of nourishment. At first _T. pallidum_ grows in\r\nthe solid medium, and then when the cultural conditions in the lower\r\nfluid portion become favourable, the organisms migrate thither and\r\nmultiply abundantly. At first the culture is impure, but after several\r\ntransferences a pure culture is obtained readily.\r\n\r\nThe syphilitic material for culture is prepared by cutting off pieces\r\nof tissue from the lesions, washing in sterile salt solution containing\r\n1 per cent. sodium citrate, and then emulsifying the tissue in a mortar\r\nwith sodium citrate.\r\n\r\nGood cultures show rapid multiplication, which is invariably by\r\nlongitudinal division.\r\n\r\nIn his various cultivation experiments Noguchi[166] found morphological\r\nand pathogenic variations in _T. pallidum_. Three forms of the organism\r\nwere found, namely, thicker, average and thinner types. The lesions\r\ncaused in the testicle of the rabbit differ according to the variety\r\ninoculated, but more work is necessary on the subject.\r\n\r\n[166] _Journ. Exptl. Med._, xv, p. 201.\r\n\r\nNoguchi[167] has cultivated a separate organism, _T. calligyrum_, from\r\nthe surface of human genital or anal lesions, either syphilitic or\r\nnon-syphilitic. It is apparently non-pathogenic, and is 6 µ to 14 µ\r\nlong.\r\n\r\n[167] _Journ. Exptl. Med._, xvii, p. 89.\r\n\r\nHata (1913)[168] has modified the Noguchi technique for the cultivation\r\nof spirochætes and treponemes, with a view to simplification and\r\nconvenience. Hata substitutes normal horse serum for ascitic fluid\r\nand the “buffy coat” of the clot of horse blood in place of the small\r\npieces of rabbit’s kidney. It is unnecessary to place sterile paraffin\r\non the surface of the medium.\r\n\r\n[168] _Centralbl. f. Bakt._, Orig., lxxii, p. 107.\r\n\r\nThe horse serum is mixed with twice its volume of physiological\r\nsaline solution. The mixture is placed in tubes which are heated on\r\na water-bath at 58° C., the temperature being raised gradually until\r\nit reaches 70° or 71° C. in three hours. The tubes are then heated at\r\n71° C. for half an hour. After cooling, the contents will consist of\r\nan opaque semi-coagulated mass. This semi-coagulated serum and saline\r\nmixture may be substituted for Noguchi’s ascitic fluid.\r\n\r\nThe buff coagulum is cut into small pieces, about 1 c.c. in volume.\r\nThey must be forced with a sterile glass rod to the bottom of the\r\nsemi-coagulated serum and saline mixture. The medium is inoculated with\r\na small quantity of infected blood and kept at 37° C. In the case of\r\n_S. recurrentis_, growth of spirochætes is observed on the second day,\r\nreaching a maximum in five to seven days. The growth of the organisms\r\nproceeds rather more slowly, they live for a longer period and maintain\r\ntheir virulence better than in Noguchi’s medium.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Treponema pertenue*, Castellani, 1905.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Spirochæta pertenuis_; _S. pallidula_, Castellani, 1905.\r\n\r\nCastellani discovered the organism in 1905, in scrapings of yaws\r\npustules. He first described it under the name of _Spirochæta\r\npertenuis_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.--_Treponema pertenue_. (After Castellani and\r\nChalmers.)]\r\n\r\n_Treponema pertenue_ (fig. 58), though delicate and slender, shows\r\ngreat morphological variation both in length and thickness. It may be\r\nshort, _e.g._, 7 µ, but can attain 18 µ to 20 µ in length and may be\r\neven larger. In cultures made by Noguchi, thick, medium and thin forms\r\nwere found, each giving rise to a different type of frambœsial lesion\r\nwhen inoculated into the testicles of rabbits, thus suggesting the\r\npossibility of the occurrence of varieties of _T. pertenue_.\r\n\r\nThe organism is difficult to stain, but occasionally deeper staining\r\ngranules are found along its body. They may represent a diffuse\r\nnucleus. Granule formation similar to that of _T. pallidum_ has been\r\nobserved by Ranken, using dark-ground illumination.\r\n\r\nMany experiments have been made with a view to establishing the\r\nidentity of the organism of yaws and also of differentiating between\r\nthe causative agents of yaws and syphilis. Both monkeys and the human\r\nsubject have been experimentally inoculated with yaws material and have\r\ndeveloped the disease.\r\n\r\nIn an early experiment, negroes were inoculated with the secretion\r\nfrom lesions of yaws. All of them developed the disease, nodules\r\nappearing, chiefly at the seat of inoculation, in from twelve to twenty\r\ndays, followed by the usual eruption. Similar results were obtained\r\nwith thirty-two Chinese prisoners, who were inoculated with yaws,\r\ntwenty-eight becoming infected.\r\n\r\nA naturally infected yaws patient when inoculated with syphilis,\r\ncontracted that infection, thus showing that yaws does not confer\r\nimmunity to syphilis. This has also been observed naturally, when yaws\r\npatients have contracted syphilis.\r\n\r\nExperiments with monkeys have been successfully performed. The\r\nincubation period varies from sixteen to ninety-two days. Lesions\r\nappear first at the seat of inoculation, and in some monkeys the\r\neruption is localized to this spot, though the infection is general,\r\n_T. pertenue_ occurring in the spleen, lymphatics, etc. Monkeys\r\ninoculated with splenic blood of a yaws patient, and also sometimes\r\nwith blood from the general circulation, have become infected.\r\n\r\nCastellani and others have shown that monkeys successfully inoculated\r\nwith syphilis do not become immune to yaws, and vice-versâ.\r\n\r\nCraig and Ashburn, using the monkey _Cynomolgus philippinensis_, found\r\nthese animals susceptible to yaws but not to syphilis.\r\n\r\nThe ulcerated lesions of frambœsia are rapidly invaded by numerous\r\nbacteria as well as by different spirochætes, of which Castellani has\r\ndescribed three distinct species. One is identical with _Spirochæta\r\nrefringens_, Schaudinn, the other two are thin and delicate. One, _S.\r\nobtusa_, has blunt ends; the other _S. acuminata_, has pointed ends.\r\n_T. pertenue_ is also present.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for considering _T. pertenue_ to be the specific cause of\r\nframbœsia are:--\r\n\r\n(1) _T. pertenue_ is the only organism present in non-ulcerated\r\npapules, in the spleen and in the lymphatics of yaws patients, or of\r\nmonkeys artificially infected with the disease. By no method has any\r\nother organism been obtained.\r\n\r\n(2) Extract of frambœsia material, free from all organisms other than\r\n_T. pertenue_, reproduces the disease if inoculated.\r\n\r\n(3) Extract of frambœsia material deprived by filtration of _T.\r\npertenue_ is no longer infective on inoculation.\r\n\r\nThe method of infection is contaminative, by direct contact. Women\r\nin Ceylon are frequently infected by their children. Any slight skin\r\nabrasion is sufficient to admit the parasite. In some cases, insects\r\nmay carry the disease from person to person, and even in hospitals,\r\nwhen dressings are removed, it has been noticed that flies greedily\r\nsuck the secretion from the ulcers. _T. pertenue_ has been recovered\r\nfrom flies that have fed on yaws, and monkeys have contracted the\r\ndisease when flies were placed and retained on them for a short time,\r\nafter the insects had fed on yaws material.\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION.--_T. pertenue_ has been cultivated by Noguchi, who finds\r\nthree types of parasites in his cultures, as before mentioned. Its\r\nmultiplication is by longitudinal division.\r\n\r\nNoguchi[169] (1912), has cultivated species of Treponema from the human\r\nmouth, e.g., _T. macrodentium_, _T. microdentium_ and _T. mucosum_, the\r\nlatter from pyorrhea alveolaris. These parasites in the past may have\r\nbeen confused under the name _Spirochæta dentium_.\r\n\r\n[169] _Journ. Exptl. Med._, xv, p. 81; xvi, p. 194.\r\n\r\n\r\nClass III. *SPOROZOA*, Leuckart, 1879.\r\n\r\nThe third group of the Protozoa consists entirely of parasitic\r\norganisms forming the class known as the Sporozoa or spore-producing\r\nanimals. The members of this class are characterized by possessing\r\nvery great powers of multiplication, coupled with a capacity for\r\nproducing forms that serve for the transference of the organisms\r\nto other hosts. These reproductive bodies, whether for increase of\r\nnumbers within one host or for transmission to another host, are called\r\nspores. But, strictly, the term spore should be used only in the latter\r\nconnection, when a protective or resistant coat known as a sporocyst\r\nenvelops the body of the spore.\r\n\r\nThe Sporozoa are widely distributed, occurring in various tissues and\r\norgans of Annelids, Molluscs, Arthropods, and Vertebrates. Their food,\r\nwhich is fluid, is absorbed osmotically. The life-cycle of a Sporozoön\r\nmay be completed within one host or may be distributed between two\r\ndifferent hosts.\r\n\r\nThe Sporozoa were divided by Schaudinn into two groups or sub-classes,\r\ncalled (1) the *Telosporidia*, and (2) the *Neosporidia*.\r\n\r\nThe Telosporidia are Sporozoa in which the reproductive phase of the\r\nparasites is distinct from the growing or trophic phase, and follows\r\nafter it. The Neosporidia include Sporozoa in which growth and\r\nspore-formation go on simultaneously. This classification is not final,\r\nfor certain exceptions and difficulties are already known with regard\r\nto it. It is possible that the class Sporozoa is not a natural entity,\r\nbut should be replaced by two classes of equal rank, corresponding in\r\nmost respects with the Telosporidia and Neosporidia.\r\n\r\nThe *Telosporidia* comprise the *Gregarinida*, the *Coccidiidea*, and\r\nthe *Hæmosporidia*. Doflein combines the two latter orders into one\r\nknown as the *Coccidiomorpha*.\r\n\r\nThe *Neosporidia* comprise the *Myxosporidia*, the *Microsporidia*, the\r\n*Actinomyxidia*, the *Sarcosporidia*, and the *Haplosporidia*. Doflein\r\ncombines the first three orders into one, the *Cnidosporidia*.\r\n\r\n\r\nSub-Class. TELOSPORIDIA, Schaudinn.\r\n\r\nSporozoa in which the reproductive phases follow completion of growth.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder. *Gregarinida*, Aimé Schneider emend. Doflein.\r\n\r\n  Knowledge of the Gregarinida probably goes back as far as the year\r\n  1684, when Redi observed gregarines in the crab, _Cancer pagurus_.\r\n  Von Cavolini (1787) found them in _Cancer depressus_. The name\r\n  _Gregarina_ was created by L. Dufour (1828), who observed masses\r\n  of these organisms in the gut of insects of different orders.\r\n  Hammerschmidt (1838) and von Siebold found rich infestations in\r\n  insects, while Dujardin (1835) and Henle described various genera\r\n  from segmented worms. Henle (1835) also observed cysts containing\r\n  “navicellæ” in the sperm-sacs of segmented worms, and attention was\r\n  drawn to his researches by the discovery by von Siebold (1839) of\r\n  “pseudonavicellæ” in the gut of _Sciara nitidicollis_. Up to this\r\n  time many workers considered the gregarines to be worms, but Kölliker\r\n  (1845) investigated many of them and maintained their unicellular\r\n  nature, while Stein’s work (1848) showed the interrelation of the\r\n  pseudonavicellæ and the gregarines. The discovery of amœboid germs\r\n  in the pseudonavicellæ by Lieberkühn (1855) and the demonstration of\r\n  myonemes further aided in the elucidation of their true systematic\r\n  position. The entire process of conjugation, of which Dufour had seen\r\n  one phase, was followed by Giard under the microscope.\r\n\r\n  From 1873 onwards Aimé Schneider made important additions to the\r\n  knowledge of the morphology, life-history, and systematic position\r\n  of numerous gregarines. Bütschli (1881) and L. Léger (1892) also\r\n  contributed much work on the subject. The discoveries of Schaudinn\r\n  with regard to the life-cycle of Coccidia gave a fresh stimulus to\r\n  the study of the Gregarines, whereby the life-cycles of numerous\r\n  forms and the phases thereof have been elucidated.\r\n\r\n  Asexual multiplication is not common among the Gregarines, but is\r\n  known to occur in the sub-order Schizogregarinea, formerly known as\r\n  the Amœbosporidia.\r\n\r\n  Although the Gregarinida are not known to be parasitic in man or\r\n  other vertebrates, they are of great interest, inasmuch as they are\r\n  among the earliest known Sporozoa, and therefore will be briefly\r\n  described here.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.--_Monocystis agilis_ from seminal vesicles of\r\n_Lumbricus_ × 250. (After Stein.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.--_Gregarina longa_ from larva of crane-fly\r\n(_Tipula_). _a_, in epithelial cell of host; _b_, _c_, gradually\r\nleaving host-cell; _d_, adhering to host-cell; _e_, fully developed\r\nfree trophozoite.]\r\n\r\nThe Gregarines are usually elongate, somewhat flattened organisms\r\n(figs. 59, 60), whose bodies are enclosed in an elastic and often\r\nthick cuticle. The enclosed living substance shows a separation into\r\nectoplasm and endoplasm, as is common among Protozoa. The cuticle is\r\nsometimes regarded as the outer portion or epicyte of the ectoplasm.\r\nA single, vesicular, spherical, or elliptical, large nucleus, with\r\nits chromatin concentrated to form a spherical karyosome, is present.\r\nThe body of some gregarines may be divided by ingrowing ectoplasmic\r\npartitions or septa, and are then said to be “septate” or “polycystid”\r\n(fig. 61). Other gregarines remain simple and non-septate, and are\r\ntermed “monocystid” (fig. 59). The monocystid gregarines occur\r\nespecially in the body cavity of Chætopoda and Insecta, more rarely\r\nin Echinodermata, in the parenchyma of Platyhelminthes, also in the\r\ngut of Tunicata and Insecta (fig. 60) and in the seminal vesicles\r\nof Annelida. In the polycystid gregarines a single septum only is\r\npresent as a rule, and thus the body presents two portions: (1) an\r\nanterior portion termed the protomerite; (2) a posterior, larger\r\nportion, known as the deutomerite, which generally contains the\r\nnucleus. The protomerite is often modified anteriorly to form an organ\r\nof attachment, termed the epimerite (fig. 61), which is developed\r\nfrom the pointed rostrum of the sporozoite or primary infecting young\r\ngregarine. The structure of the epimerite may be complicated, being\r\nprovided with hooks, spines, knobs, and other appendages. An extension\r\nof the polycystid condition is seen in _Tæniocystis mira_ Léger (from\r\nthe dipteran larva, _Ceratopogon solstitialis_), whose body shows a\r\nnumber of partitions, giving the organism a superficial resemblance to\r\na tapeworm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.--_Xyphorhynchus firmus_ with epimerite in\r\nintestinal epithelial cell of host. (After Léger.)]\r\n\r\nThe ectoplasm of a gregarine exhibits three layers: (1) An epicyte\r\n(cuticle) externally of which the epimerite is composed; (2) a\r\nsarcocyte which forms the septa if present; (3) the deeper myocyte\r\nlayer containing contractile elements in the form of fibrils or threads\r\ntermed myonemes (fig. 62).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.--_Gregarina munieri_ (from the beetle,\r\n_Chrysomela hæmoptera_). Section through surface layers. _Cu_, cuticle;\r\n_E_, ectoplasm proper; _G_, gelatinous layer; _My_, myonemes in myocyte\r\nlayer. × 1500. (After Schewiakoff.)]\r\n\r\nThe endoplasm is fluid and granular, containing many enclosures,\r\nwhich are of the nature of reserve food materials. They consist of\r\nfat droplets or of paraglycogen, and give the organisms an opaque\r\nappearance. _Lithocystis_ contains crystals of calcium oxalate in its\r\nendoplasm.\r\n\r\nMany gregarines are capable of active movements, though they do not\r\npossess obvious locomotor organs. The movement is of a smooth, gliding\r\ncharacter and two suggestions have been put forward to explain it.\r\nAccording to Schewiakoff, a gelatinous substance is secreted between\r\nthe layers of the ectoplasm. This is extruded posteriorly and thus the\r\nanimal is pushed forward. On the other hand, Crawley considers that\r\nthe movements are produced by contractions of the myonemes. These two\r\nexplanations are probably correct as far as each goes, and are to be\r\nregarded as supplementary to one another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.--_Monocystis agilis_. Spores from vesicula\r\nseminalis of the Earthworm. _a_, Sporoblast with single nucleus,\r\nenclosed in sporocyst; _b_, mature spore containing sporozoites; _c_,\r\ndiagrammatic cross-section of spore, showing eight sporozoites round\r\nresidual protoplasm. (After Bütschli.)]\r\n\r\nOccasionally, temporary associations of gregarines are formed by\r\na number of individuals adhering to one another end to end. Such\r\ntemporary associations are examples of syzygy. Such syzygies must not\r\nbe confused with true associations which form an essential part of the\r\nlife-cycle.\r\n\r\nThe life-cycle of a relatively simple gregarine, such as _Monocystis\r\nagilis_ (fig. 59), parasitic in earthworms, may now be considered.\r\nThe gregarines, being members of the Sporozoa, produce spores at one\r\nphase of the life-cycle. Each gregarine spore (fig. 63) develops\r\nwithin itself a number of minute, sickle-shaped or vermicular bodies,\r\nknown as sporozoites or primary infecting germs. Eight sporozoites are\r\noften formed within each spore. When absorbed by a new host, the spore\r\nsoftens and the sporozoites issue from it. They are capable of active\r\nmovement and may or may not enter a cell, such as one of those of the\r\ndigestive tract, or, as in _Monocystis_, a cell lining the vesicula\r\nseminalis which becomes a sperm-cell aggregate (sperm morula). When the\r\nsporozoite has reached the place of its choice in the host it ceases\r\nactive movements and proceeds to feed passively on the fluid substances\r\naround it, whether they be those of tissues or body fluids. This\r\npassive, growing and feeding form is known as the trophozoite. After a\r\ntrophic existence of longer or shorter duration, the trophozoite ceases\r\nto feed and prepares for reproduction. Two trophozoites associate\r\ntogether, each of them first becoming somewhat rounded. The two\r\ntrophozoites, now known as sporonts or gametocytes, become invested\r\nin a single common envelope or cyst (fig. 64, _a_). The nucleus of\r\neach gametocyte then divides by a series of binary fissions (fig. 64,\r\n_b_), and the daughter nuclei thus produced arrange themselves at the\r\nperiphery of the parent cells (fig. 64, _c_). Cytoplasm collects around\r\neach of these nuclei, and thus a number of gametes are formed within\r\neach gametocyte. The gametes for a time exhibit active movements, and\r\nultimately ripe gametes of different parentage fuse in pairs, that is,\r\nconjugation occurs (fig. 64, _d_). In this way zygotes are produced,\r\nthe nucleus of each zygote being formed by the fusion of two gamete\r\nnuclei.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.--Schematic figures of conjugation and spore\r\nformation in Gregarines. For details see text. (After Calkins and\r\nSiedlecki, modified.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.--_Stylorhynchus oblongatus_. _a_, cyst\r\ncontaining two sporonts or gametocytes, each full of gametes, those in\r\nthe upper one being male. _b_, ripe male and female gametes. × 1,600.\r\n(After L. Léger.)]\r\n\r\nThe zygote grows slightly and becomes oval or elongate, and at this\r\nperiod is often called the sporoblast. It then secretes an external\r\nmembrane, the sporocyst. Nuclear division occurs inside the sporocyst\r\nby a series of three binary fissions (fig. 64, _e_), so that each\r\nsporocyst, now usually referred to as a spore, contains eight nuclei.\r\nThe cytoplasm collects around each nucleus and eight vermicular\r\nsporozoites are produced within each spore (fig. 64, _f_), thus\r\ncompleting the life-cycle.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that in the above life-cycle no asexual\r\nmultiplication occurs. These organisms, such as _Monocystis_, are known\r\nas the Eugregarines, and include the majority of the gregarines. The\r\nremainder, which have introduced schizogony into their life-cycle, are\r\nknown as the Schizogregarines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.--Spores of various Gregarines. _a_,\r\n_Xiphorhynchus_. _b_, _Ancyrophora_. _c_, _Gonospora_. _d_,\r\n_Ceratospora_. (After Léger.)]\r\n\r\nThere are variations in the morphology and life-cycle of gregarines\r\nbesides those that have been mentioned. It is not within the scope of\r\nthis book to discuss them in detail, but the following may be noted:--\r\n\r\nMorphological differentiation of gametes may occur as in _Stylorhynchus\r\noblongatus_ (fig. 65), which differentiation is probably of a sexual\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nThe sporocyst really consists of two layers, an epispore and an\r\nendospore. Externally the spores of different gregarines show great\r\nvariety in shape and markings, and spines, or long processes may be\r\npresent (fig. 66).\r\n\r\nThe resistant spores serve for the transmission of the gregarines\r\nfrom host to host. The mode of infection is contaminative, the spores\r\nexpelled with the dejecta of one host being absorbed with the food of a\r\nnew host.\r\n\r\nThe Gregarinida may be classified as follows:--\r\n\r\nSub-order I.--*Eugregarinea*, without schizogony.\r\n\r\nTribe 1.--_Acephalina_.--Without an epimerite and non-septate; often\r\n“cœlomic” (body-cavity) parasites. _E.g._: _Monocystis_, with several\r\nspecies parasitic in the seminal vesicles of earthworms. Many other\r\ngenera parasitic in Echinodermata, Tunicata, Arthropoda, etc.\r\n\r\nTribe 2.--_Cephalina_.--With an epimerite, either temporarily\r\nor permanently, in the trophic phase. Usually septate (except\r\n_Doliocystidæ_). Many families, genera and species. Common in the\r\ndigestive tracts of insects. _E.g._: _Gregarina_, with several\r\nspecies, _Gregarina ovata_ in the earwig, _Gregarina blattarum_ in the\r\ncockroach, _Stylorhynchus_ in beetles, _Pterocephalus_ in centipedes,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nSub-order II.--*Schizogregarinea*, with schizogony.\r\n\r\nTribe 1.--_Endoschiza_.[170]--With schizogony occurring in the\r\nintracellular phase, _e.g._, _Selenidium_ (from Annelida and Gephyrea),\r\n_Merogregarina_ (from an Ascidian).\r\n\r\n[170] See Fantham (1908), _Parasitology_, i, p. 369.\r\n\r\nTribe 2.--_Ectoschiza_.--In which the schizont is free, and schizogony\r\nis extracellular, _e.g._, _Ophryocystis_ (from _Blaps_, a beetle), and\r\n_Schizocystis_ (from _Ceratopogon_ larva).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Order. *Coccidiidea*.\r\n\r\n  Hake (1839) first saw the organisms now termed Coccidia during\r\n  his investigations on the so-called coccidial nodules of rabbits.\r\n  The opinions as to the nature of these peculiar formations were\r\n  very diverse. The discoverer considered them to be a sort of pus\r\n  corpuscle; Nasse (1843) took them for epithelial cells of the biliary\r\n  passages, others for helminthes, especially the ova of trematodes\r\n  (Dujardin, Küchenmeister, Gubler, etc). Remak (1845) was the first to\r\n  draw attention to their relation to the Psorospermia (Myxosporidia),\r\n  and this investigator found them also in the small intestine and\r\n  vermiform appendix of rabbits. Lieberkühn (1854), who examined\r\n  not only the coccidia of rabbits, but found similar forms in the\r\n  kidneys of frogs, likewise called them definitely psorosperms. To\r\n  differentiate Müller’s psorosperms, which are found in fishes, from\r\n  those of rabbits, etc., the latter were called egg-shaped psorosperms\r\n  (Eimer), until R. Leuckart (1879) named them _Coccidia_ and placed\r\n  them in a group of the Sporozoa analogous to that of the Gregarinida,\r\n  Myxosporidia, etc. Numerous works confirmed the occurrence of\r\n  coccidia, not only in all classes of vertebrate animals, but also in\r\n  invertebrates (Mollusca, Myriapoda, Annelida, etc.). A large number\r\n  of genera and species have in the course of time been described\r\n  which inhabit the epithelium of the intestine and its appendages for\r\n  choice, but are also found in other organs (kidneys, spleen, ovaries,\r\n  vas deferens, testicles). Some also live in the connective tissue of\r\n  various organs, more particularly of the intestine.\r\n\r\n  The knowledge of the development of the coccidia was of particular\r\n  importance in determining their classification. By means of encysted\r\n  coccidia from the liver of rabbits, Kauffmann (1847) first confirmed\r\n  the fact that the cyst, which was partly or entirely filled with\r\n  granular contents, divided into three or four pale bodies (fig. 71)\r\n  after a long sojourn in water. Lieberkühn observed the same process\r\n  in the host in the case of the coccidia of the kidney of the frog.\r\n  Stieda (1865) studied more minutely the changes that occur within\r\n  the encysted coccidia of the liver of rabbits after the death of\r\n  the host. He discovered that the bodies now known as “spores” were\r\n  oval formations pointed at one pole, and surrounded by a delicate\r\n  membrane, which exhibited a certain thickness at the pointed\r\n  extremity and enclosed a slightly bent rodlet, expanding at either\r\n  end into a strongly light-refracting globule; a finely granular\r\n  globule was present in the middle of the spore. Waldenburg (1862) saw\r\n  the same phenomenon in coccidia from the epithelium of the villi and\r\n  Lieberkühn’s glands of the intestine of the rabbit; but the process\r\n  in this case took place in a much shorter time.\r\n\r\n  According to the discovery of Kloss (1855), the spores of the\r\n  coccidia of the urinary organ of the garden snail were formed in far\r\n  greater numbers: the round spores also harboured several (five to\r\n  six) rodlets, which after the bursting of the spore-envelope became\r\n  free. Eimer’s researches (1870) afforded information regarding a\r\n  Coccidium from the intestine of the mouse, which was transformed\r\n  _in toto_ into a “spore,” containing small sickle-shaped bodies.\r\n  The fact was, moreover, established that the little bodies left the\r\n  delicate envelope when in the intestine, made movements of flexion\r\n  and extension, and were finally transformed into amœboid organisms,\r\n  which apparently penetrated the epithelial cells; at all events,\r\n  similar bodies of various sizes were seen in these cells. Taking the\r\n  immense number of these parasites into account and the lack of any\r\n  other cause, Eimer attributed the sudden death of his mice to the\r\n  _Gregarina falciformis_, as the parasite was then called, just in the\r\n  same way as a few years previously Reincke ascribed the acute and\r\n  fatal intestinal catarrh of rabbits to the invasion of intestinal\r\n  coccidia.\r\n\r\n  All that had become known about coccidia up to 1879 was then\r\n  compiled by Leuckart, and completed by his own observations on\r\n  the coccidia of the liver of the rabbit. Experimental infections\r\n  had already been conducted by Waldenburg (1862) with intestinal\r\n  coccidia of rabbits, and by Rivolta (1869–73) with the coccidia of\r\n  fowls, which experiments confirmed the importance of the spores,\r\n  or bodies enclosed in them, in the transmission of the parasites\r\n  to other animals. Accordingly, it was assumed that after the entry\r\n  of the spores into the intestine the sporozoites were set free,\r\n  actively penetrated into the intestinal cells, where they grew into\r\n  coccidia, and finally became encysted. The further development,\r\n  _i.e._, the formation of spores, took place outside the host’s body\r\n  in these cases; in other cases (Kloss, Eimer) it took place within\r\n  the host. Although much regarding the cycle of development was still\r\n  hypothetical, the ideas coincided with the observations, and were\r\n  therefore universally regarded as established. Further research\r\n  confirmed this view in numerous new forms.\r\n\r\n  L. Pfeiffer’s statements (1891) on the part that certain coccidia or\r\n  their sporozoites played, or seemed to play, as causes of disease\r\n  gave a renewed impetus to the investigation of the coccidia. The\r\n  ingestion of even very numerous spores did not appear to account for\r\n  the mass infection so frequently observed, even after Balbiani had\r\n  confirmed the fact that there were two, and not one, sporozoites\r\n  contained in every spore of the coccidia of rabbits (fig. 72). The\r\n  hypothesis was therefore advanced that the sporozoites or young\r\n  coccidia were able to divide once again by sporulating. The question\r\n  was finally solved quite differently. R. Pfeiffer (1892) first\r\n  confirmed the fact that in addition to the well-known method of\r\n  sporulation in the coccidia of the rabbit that causes the infection\r\n  of fresh hosts (“exogenous sporulation”), an enormous increase may\r\n  follow in the already infected host in a manner that Eimer first\r\n  observed in the coccidia of the intestine of the mouse (“endogenous\r\n  sporulation”). It had hitherto been believed that some of the\r\n  species of coccidia increased like the rabbit parasite, then known\r\n  as _Coccidium oviforme_, and others like _Eimeria falciformis_, and\r\n  this difference had been made the foundation of a classification. R.\r\n  Pfeiffer was successful in observing the occurrence of both kinds\r\n  of development in the same species, and expressed the opinion that\r\n  endogenous sporulation (fig. 73), which takes place within the host,\r\n  was the cause of the mass-infection that is mostly accompanied by\r\n  serious consequences (fig. 74). L. Pfeiffer sought, especially, to\r\n  demonstrate the correctness of this view as regards other species of\r\n  coccidia and for this purpose he utilized the experiences already\r\n  published. Coccidia were known to exist in a number of different\r\n  hosts, and to propagate in some according to the _Coccidium_ type,\r\n  in others according to the _Eimeria_ type. It therefore was reasoned\r\n  that in this case it was not a question of two species belonging\r\n  to different genera living side by side, with a different mode of\r\n  development, but of one species, in the life of which both forms of\r\n  development occurred alternately.\r\n\r\n  This interpretation of facts was combated especially by A. Schneider\r\n  (1892) and by Labbé, but has, nevertheless, proved true, apart from\r\n  the circumstance that Schuberg succeeded in discovering the hitherto\r\n  unknown _Coccidium_ form in the intestine of the mouse; and that,\r\n  moreover, Léger confirmed the fact that there are no Arthropoda in\r\n  which Eimeria are not found together with coccidia. The question\r\n  was finally settled by experiments made by Léger with the coccidia\r\n  of _Scolopendra cingulata_, by Schaudinn and Siedlecki with those\r\n  of _Lithobius forficatus_, and by Simond with the coccidia of the\r\n  rabbit. On Simond’s suggestion the sickle-shaped germs corresponding\r\n  to the sporozoites, which are formed by endogenous sporulation, are\r\n  generally termed merozoites; and in accordance with Schaudinn’s\r\n  suggestion, those individuals which form merozoites are termed\r\n  schizonts, and those which produce spores are called sporonts. In\r\n  contradistinction to sporogony (exogenous sporulation), the term\r\n  schizogony (endogenous sporulation) is used.\r\n\r\n  The more minute examination of these processes at last led to the\r\n  discovery of sexual dimorphism, of copulation and of alternation of\r\n  generations in the coccidia. Schuberg was the first to consider the\r\n  possibility of copulation in coccidia; in addition to the formations\r\n  which now are termed merozoites, he observed very diminutive\r\n  bodies (“microsporozoites”) in the coccidia of the intestine of\r\n  the mouse, which were able eventually to copulate. Labbé confirmed\r\n  this observation in some of the species, and Simond expressed\r\n  the opinion that bodies termed “chromatozoites” occurred in all\r\n  coccidia. Copulation itself was then observed by Schaudinn and\r\n  Siedlecki (1897). The copulating bodies were termed gametes. As,\r\n  however, they differed considerably one from the other, the males\r\n  were called microgametes (_i.e._, the microsporozoites of Labbé and\r\n  the chromatozoites of Simond) and the females macrogametes. After\r\n  copulation was completed sporogony took place, and in the cycle of\r\n  development of one species this regularly alternated with schizogony\r\n  (asexual multiplication). Schaudinn in 1900 described in detail the\r\n  life-cycle of _Eimeria_ (_Coccidium_) _schubergi_.\r\n\r\n  The recognition of this unsuspected complicated process was bound to\r\n  effect reforms in the classification of the coccidia; and all the\r\n  forms that had been regarded as developmental stages (_Eimeria_,\r\n  etc.) had to be reconsidered.\r\n\r\n_Occurrence._--The Coccidiidea in their mature condition usually live\r\nwithin the epithelial cells of various organs, and by choice inhabit\r\nthose of the intestine and of its associated organs. They also occur\r\nfrequently in the excretory organs of mammals, birds, amphibia,\r\nmolluscs, arthropods, and may also be found in the testes and vas\r\ndeferens, but the statement that they live in hen’s eggs, as well as\r\nin the oviducts of fowls, has not been confirmed.[171] Some species\r\ninhabit the nuclei of cells, others live in the connective tissue, but\r\ntheir presence in the latter situation is probably only secondary,\r\nthat is, they have only reached it from the epithelium of the affected\r\norgans.\r\n\r\n[171] Notwithstanding the progress made during the last decades, the\r\nova of helminthes and more particularly of trematodes, have been\r\nmistaken for Coccidia. Thus Poschinger (_Zool. Anz._, 1819, ix, p. 471)\r\nand Gebhard (_Virchow’s Arch._, 1897, No. 147, p. 536) mistook the ova\r\nof _Distoma turgidum_, Brds., for Coccidia. Podwyssotzki (_Centralbl.\r\nf. allg. Path._, 1890, i, p. 135) made a similar error with the ova\r\n(and vitelline sacs) of a species of _Prosthogonimus_ (_Distoma ovatum_\r\nof the authors); von Willach (_Arch. f. wiss. u. prakt. Thierheilk._,\r\n1892, xviii, p. 242) mistook the ova of a nematode for Coccidia.\r\n\r\nThe size of the Coccidiidea, corresponding as a rule to the capacity\r\nof their habitat, is usually small, but there are said to be species\r\nthat attain a diameter of 1 mm. Their form[172] is globular, oval,\r\nor elliptical. External appendages are lacking, at least during\r\nthe trophic or vegetative period of their life, which is spent in\r\nepithelial cells, within which they increase in size. Frequently one\r\nonly is present in each cell, but more can occur. The body substance\r\nis composed of a more or less finely granular or distinctly alveolar\r\nprotoplasm which exhibits no differentiation into ecto- and endoplasm.\r\nAll species possess a nucleus that enlarges with their growth;\r\nsometimes it only shows through the cytoplasm as a lighter spot, or may\r\neven be quite concealed. It is vesicular, and besides containing very\r\ndelicate threads of chromatin in the clear nucleoplasm, it contains\r\ngenerally only one large karyosome.\r\n\r\n[172] The life-cycle given here is based on that of _Eimeria_\r\n(_Coccidium_) _schubergi_, after Schaudinn (1900). See “Untersuchungen\r\nüber den Generationswechsel bei Coccidien,” _Zool. Jahrb., Abt. f.\r\nAnat._, xiii, pp. 197–292, 4 plates.\r\n\r\nThe infected epithelial cells degenerate sooner or later as the\r\nparasite feeds on them (fig. 67, II-IV). After their form has been\r\nchanged by the action of the growing parasite, they finally perish.\r\nThe cell membrane then alone surrounds the coccidia, which, at least\r\nin the species sufficiently known, begin to propagate by an asexual\r\nprocess (schizogony), the parasites themselves becoming schizonts, as\r\nthe initial stage is usually called. They differ from later stages\r\n(sporonts or gametocytes), which resemble them in form, by the absence\r\nof granulations in the cytoplasm, as well as by the vesicular nucleus.\r\nThe form is not always the same, for in some cases, at least, many\r\nschizonts assume a globular form.\r\n\r\nSchizogony (fig. 67, V-VII) commences with a division of the nucleus,\r\nwhich takes place in different ways in the various species. This\r\nfinally leads to the formation of numerous daughter nuclei which\r\nbecome smaller and smaller, and which collect beneath the surface of\r\nthe schizonts. In some species the daughter nuclei collect only in one\r\nhalf of the schizont. A part of the protoplasm of the periphery now\r\ndivides around each daughter nucleus, the remaining part (residual\r\nbody) being left in the centre or on one side. The segments of the\r\ndivided cytoplasm, each containing a nucleus, assume a fusiform shape\r\nand become merozoites, which very soon become free (fig. 67, VIII) and\r\nleave the residual body. They are distinguishable from the very similar\r\nsporozoites (fig. 67, I), as the merozoites possess a karyosome.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67.--Life-cycle of _Eimeria_ (_Coccidium_)\r\n_schubergi_, Schaud., from the intestine of _Lithobius_. (After\r\nSchaudinn.) The infection is caused by a cyst (XX), containing spores,\r\nwhich reaches the intestine of a _Lithobius_, where it discharges the\r\nsporozoites (I).

In addition, there are gliding movements similar to\r\n  those of many gregarines, and brought about in a like manner by the\r\n  secretion at the posterior extremity of a gelatinous substance that\r\n  hardens rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe merozoites do not gain the open in the usual way, but are destined\r\nto infect still further the same host by actively penetrating into\r\nother epithelial cells of the affected organ. Here they continue their\r\ngrowth and may again and again undergo schizogony. In the Infusoria\r\nthe repeated segmentations finally cease and are renewed only after\r\na conjugation. This is likewise the case with the Coccidia, with the\r\ndifference that in the latter the two conjugating individuals (gametes)\r\nare differently constituted one from the other, whereas in the\r\nInfusoria they are almost always similar.\r\n\r\nWhen the schizogony ceases, the merozoites, that had penetrated\r\nthe epithelial cells and become trophozoites there, consist of two\r\nkinds of differently constituted individuals. One kind possesses a\r\nclear cytoplasm (fig. 67, XII), the other an opaque, richly granular\r\ncytoplasm (fig. 67, XI), while both possess a vesicular nucleus\r\nwith a karyosome. In order to continue their development, the more\r\ngranular individuals must be fertilized, and are therefore termed\r\neither female gametes or, on account of their size, macrogametes.\r\nThe male individuals (microgametes) necessary to conjugation, are\r\nformed in greater numbers from the less dense microgametocytes or\r\nmale mother-cells (fig. 67, XIId). They are slender bodies consisting\r\nchiefly of nuclear substance, and in most species bear two flagella\r\nof unequal length directed backwards, the place of insertion of which\r\nvaries according to the species (fig. 67, XIIe).\r\n\r\nWhile the development of the microgametes is rapidly advancing a change\r\noccurs in the nucleus of the female parent forms or macrogametocytes.\r\nParts of the karyosome are extruded (fig. 67, XIc), and the nucleus\r\nloses at the same time its vesicular form. One macrogamete results,\r\nafter nuclear maturation, from one macrogametocyte. By this time\r\nthe macrogametes are capable of conjugation, and the process takes\r\nplace within the host, generally, however, outside the affected and\r\ndegenerated host cells. The microgametes that have now become free from\r\nthe very large residual body, crowd around the mature macrogametes,\r\nwhich often send out a small prominence (“cone of reception” or\r\nfertilization protuberance) for their reception (fig. 67, XIII). As\r\nsoon as a microgamete comes in contact with this and penetrates into\r\nthe cytoplasm of the macrogamete, the latter surrounds itself with\r\na membrane which prevents the intrusion of other microgametes. The\r\nnucleus of the microgamete that has gained entry unites with the\r\nnucleus of the macrogamete, which latter is afterwards capable of\r\nforming the well-known spores. The parasite is now called an encysted\r\nzygote or oöcyst. The oöcysts of some other members of the Coccidiidea,\r\n_e.g._, _Eimeria avium_, can form their walls prior to fertilization.\r\nIn such cases, a weak spot is left at one place in the cyst wall,\r\nforming a micropyle, that permits of the entry of the male, immediately\r\nafter which the micropyle is closed.\r\n\r\n  The reduced nucleus of the macrogamete elongates on the entry of the\r\n  microgamete, and becomes a fertilization spindle to which the male\r\n  pronucleus (from the microgamete) becomes attached (fig. 67, XIV and\r\n  XV). Thereupon the spindle divides into two daughter nuclei (fig. 67,\r\n  XVI) which assume a round shape. The protoplasm at this stage may\r\n  at once divide, or another segmentation of the daughter nuclei may\r\n  first occur. In the former case the two halves divide again, so\r\n  that finally four nucleated segments, the sporoblasts, are formed,\r\n  whereas in the latter case the four sporoblasts appear simultaneously\r\n  (fig. 67, XVII). In both cases a residual body of varying size is\r\n  separated from the protoplasm of the oöcyst. As a rule the oöcysts\r\n  have already been discharged from the body of the host, and in the\r\n  manner described above, form the sporoblasts after a longer or\r\n  shorter period of incubation.\r\n\r\nThe sporoblasts are originally naked, but each soon secretes a\r\nhomogeneous membrane, the sporocyst, in which it becomes enveloped\r\n(fig. 67, XVIII). After the segmentation of the nucleus the contents\r\ndivide into two sickle-shaped sporozoites, in addition to which there\r\nis generally also a residual body (fig. 67, XIX).\r\n\r\nThis terminates the development. The spores are intended for the\r\ninfection of other hosts. If they reach the intestine of suitable\r\nhosts, either free or enclosed in the oöcyst wall, the action of the\r\nintestinal juices causes them to open and permits the escape of the\r\nsporozoites (fig. 67, XX). The latter move exactly like the merozoites\r\nand soon make their way into epithelial cells (fig. 67, I), where they\r\nbecome schizonts, and thus repeat the life cycle.\r\n\r\n  Although our knowledge of the development of the coccidia is but of\r\n  recent date, yet it already extends to a large number of species,\r\n  which exhibit various deviations from the cycle of development\r\n  described above. For instance, in addition to differences in the\r\n  gametocytes, the schizonts of _Adelea_ and _Cyclospora_ also show\r\n  differentiation and give rise to macromerozoites and micromerozoites,\r\n  whilst in _Adelea_ and _Klossia_ a precocious association of the\r\n  gametocytes precedes the true copulation of the ripe gametes.\r\n\r\nThe classification of the Coccidiidea is based chiefly on the number of\r\nsporozoites found in each spore, and the number of sporocysts (spores)\r\nfound in one oöcyst. Léger[173] recognises two great legions, the\r\nEimeridea and the Adeleidea, the former comprising the greater number\r\nof genera, including the genus of most economic importance, _Eimeria_.\r\nIt must be noted that, though a member of this genus may be frequently\r\nreferred to as _Coccidium_, strictly it should be termed _Eimeria_,\r\nthat name having priority. The name of the disease resulting from\r\nthe action of such parasites is, however, established and remains as\r\ncoccidiosis.\r\n\r\n[173] _Arch. f. Protistenkunde_ (1911), xxii, p. 71.\r\n\r\nCertain of the more important of the Coccidiidea may now be considered.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Eimeria*, Aimé Schneider, 1875.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Psorospermium_, Rivolta, 1878; _Cytospermium_, Rivolta,\r\n  1878; _Coccidium_, R. Leuckart, 1879; _Pfeifferia_, Labbé, 1894;\r\n  _Pfeifferella_, Labbé, 1899.\r\n\r\nThe Eimeria belong to Léger’s old family, the Tetrasporocystidæ, which\r\ncomprises forms producing oöcysts with four sporocysts, each containing\r\ntwo sporozoites. The cysts are spherical or oval, as are also usually\r\nthe schizonts. The members of the genus are confined chiefly to\r\nvertebrate hosts, the more important economically occurring in mammals\r\nand birds. From the mammalian hosts very rarely the parasites may reach\r\nman. _Eimeria_ (_Coccidium_) _avium_ of wild birds and poultry, and\r\n_Eimeria stiedæ_ parasitic in rabbits, may be considered. There is a\r\ngeneral similarity in their life-cycles and each is of great practical\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Eimeria avium*, Silvestrini and Rivolta.\r\n\r\n  _Eimeria avium_ is responsible for fatal epizoötics among game birds\r\n  such as grouse, pheasants and partridges, and domestic poultry such\r\n  as fowls, ducks, pigeons and turkeys, and can pass from any one of\r\n  these hosts to any of the others with the same effect. The organism\r\n  is parasitic in the alimentary tract of the host, affecting more\r\n  especially the small intestine (duodenum) and the cæca, but in\r\n  some cases penetrating to the liver and multiplying there (as in\r\n  turkeys), producing necrotic cheesy patches, that ultimately become\r\n  full of oöcysts. The gut is rendered very frail by the action of\r\n  the parasites, its mucous membrane is greatly injured, and is often\r\n  reduced to an almost structureless pulp, riddled with parasites\r\n  (fig. 68). Infection is conveyed from host to host by the ingestion\r\n  of food or drink contaminated with the oöcysts voided in the fæces of\r\n  infected birds. Oval oöcysts from 24 µ to 35 µ long and from 14 µ to\r\n  20 µ broad are the means of infection. The oöcysts develop internally\r\n  four sporocysts or spores, from each of which two sporozoites are\r\n  produced. The life-history[174] presents two phases: (1) The asexual\r\n  multiplicative phase, schizogony, for the increase in numbers of the\r\n  parasites within the same host; (2) the reproductive phase, following\r\n  the formation of gametes (gametogony), leading to the production of\r\n  resistant oöcysts, destined for the transference of the parasite to\r\n  new hosts (sporogony).\r\n\r\n[174] Fantham, H. B. (1910), “The Morphology and Life History of\r\n_Eimeria_ (_Coccidium_) _avium_, a Sporozoön causing a fatal disease\r\namong young Grouse,” _Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond._, 1910, pp. 672–691, 4\r\nplates. Also Fantham, H. B. (1911), “Coccidiosis in British Game Birds\r\nand Poultry,” _Journ. Econ. Biol._, vi, pp. 75–96.\r\n\r\n  The oöcysts usually reach the duodenum unharmed, with food or\r\n  drink. Under the influence of the powerful digestive juices\r\n  (especially the pancreatic) now encountered, the oöcysts soften,\r\n  as do the sporocysts, and ultimately two sporozoites emerge from\r\n  each sporocyst. The sporozoites are from 7 µ to 10 µ long, and each\r\n  is vermicular with a uniform nucleus (fig. 69, A). After a short\r\n  period of active movement in the gut, each sporozoite penetrates an\r\n  epithelial cell (figs. 68 _spz_, 69, B), and once within, gradually\r\n  becomes rounded (fig. 69, B, C). It grows rapidly, feeding on the\r\n  contents of the host cell and living as a trophozoite (fig. 69,\r\n  _D_). When the parasite is from 10 µ to 12 µ in diameter, usually\r\n  multiplication by schizogony (fig. 69, E-H) begins. The nucleus\r\n  of the parent cell, now called a schizont, divides into a number\r\n  of portions that become arranged at the periphery (fig. 69, E).\r\n  Cytoplasm collects around each nucleus (fig. 69, E, F) and gradually\r\n  a group of daughter individuals (merozoites) is produced (fig. 69,\r\n  G), the nucleus of each merozoite showing a karyosome.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.--Small piece of epithelial lining of gut of\r\nheavily infected Grouse chick, showing various stages in life history\r\nof the parasite _Eimeria avium_; _par_, parasite (trophozoite); _mz_,\r\nmerozoite; _sch_, schizont; _spz_, sporozoite; _ooc_, oöcyst; ♂, male\r\ngametocyte; ♀, female gametocyte. × 750. (After Fantham.)]\r\n\r\n  The merozoites of _Eimeria avium_ are arranged “en barillet,” like\r\n  the segments of an orange (figs. 68 _mz_, 69, G), therein differing\r\n  from those of _E. schubergi_, which are arranged “en rosace.” They\r\n  separate from one another (fig. 69, H), penetrate other epithelial\r\n  cells, where they may, in turn, become schizonts. Eight to fourteen\r\n  merozoites are usually formed by each schizont, twenty have been\r\n  found, while in cases of intense infection when space has become\r\n  limited, the number may be only four.\r\n\r\n  After a number of generations of merozoites have been formed, a limit\r\n  is reached both to the multiplicative capacity of the parasite and to\r\n  the power of the bird to provide the invader with food. Consequently,\r\n  resistant forms of the parasite are necessary, and the trophozoites\r\n  begin to show sexual differentiation instead of forming schizonts,\r\n  that is, gametogony commences.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 69.--_Eimeria avium_. Diagram of life-cycle. For\r\n  explanation see text. (After Fantham.)]\r\n\r\n  Certain trophozoites store food and become large and granular. These\r\n  are macrogametocytes (fig. 69, I, ♀). The microgametocytes (fig. 69,\r\n  I, ♂) are smaller and far less granular. The macrogametocyte\r\n  continues to grow, and becomes loaded with chromatoid and plastinoid\r\n  granules (fig. 69, J, ♀), while the microgametocyte has its nucleus\r\n  divide to form a number of bent, rod-like portions (fig. 69, J, ♂).\r\n  The macrogametocyte gives rise to a single macrogamete, which forms\r\n  a cyst wall for itself, leaving a thin spot (micropyle) for the\r\n  entry of the male (fig 69, K, ♀). The microgametocyte gives rise to\r\n  numerous small, biflagellate microgametes (fig. 69, K, ♂) around a\r\n  large, central residual mass, from which they ultimately break free,\r\n  and swim away. When a macrogamete is reached, the microgamete enters\r\n  through the micropyle (fig. 69, L)--which then closes, thus excluding\r\n  the other males--and applies itself to the female nucleus (fig. 69,\r\n  M). Nuclear fusion occurs, the oöcyst (encysted zygote) being thus\r\n  produced. Sporogony then ensues. The oöcyst (fig. 69, N) at first\r\n  has its contents completely filling it. They then concentrate into\r\n  a central spherical mass (fig. 69, O) which gradually becomes\r\n  tetranucleate (fig. 69, P). Cytoplasm collects around each nucleus,\r\n  and four sporoblasts are thus formed (fig. 69, Q). Each sporoblast\r\n  becomes oval (fig. 69, R) and produces a sporocyst. Ultimately two\r\n  sporozoites are formed in each sporocyst or spore, at first lying\r\n  tête-bêche (fig. 69, S), but finally twisting to assume the position\r\n  most convenient for emergence (fig. 69, T) when they reach a new\r\n  host. The period of the life-cycle of _Eimeria avium_ (as well as\r\n  the details of the life-cycle) was determined by Fantham to be from\r\n  eight to ten days, of which period schizogony occupies four to five\r\n  days.\r\n\r\n  The method of infection[175] is contaminative, by way of food or\r\n  drink. Young birds are especially susceptible to infection. Certain\r\n  birds, particularly older ones, may act as reservoirs of oöcysts,\r\n  being continuously infected themselves, without showing any marked\r\n  ill effects from the parasite, but being highly infectious to\r\n  other birds. Much moisture retards the development of sporocysts\r\n  considerably. The duration of vitality of the infective oöcysts has\r\n  been determined experimentally to extend well over two years, and in\r\n  certain cases longer. _Eimeria avium_ is the causal agent of “white\r\n  diarrhœa” or “white scour” in fowls, and of “blackhead” in turkeys.\r\n\r\n[175] Fantham, H. B. (1910), “Experimental Studies on Avian\r\nCoccidiosis, especially in relation to young Grouse, Fowls and\r\nPigeons,” _Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond._, 1910, pp. 722–731, 1 plate.\r\n\r\n_Eimeria avium_ of birds and _E. stiedæ_ of rabbits closely resemble\r\none another, but are not the same parasite, for _E. avium_ is not\r\ninfective to rabbits, nor _E. stiedæ_ to poultry.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Eimeria stiedæ*, Lindemann, 1865.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Monocystis stiedæ_, Lindemann, 1865; _Psorospermium cuniculi_,\r\n  Rivolta, 1878; _Cytospermium hominis_, Rivolta, 1878; _Coccidium\r\n  oviforme_, Leuckart, 1879; _Coccidium perforans_, Leuckart, 1879;\r\n  _Coccidium cuniculi_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.--_Eimeria stiedæ_. Section through an infected\r\nvillus of rabbit’s intestine. × 260.]\r\n\r\n_Eimeria stiedæ_ is parasitic in the gut epithelium (fig. 70), liver,\r\nand epithelium of the bile ducts of rabbits, and is usually considered\r\nto be the parasite very occasionally found in man. The life-cycle\r\nresembles that of _Eimeria avium_ in its general outlines (see fig. 69)\r\nand therefore will not be detailed in full here. The oöcysts (fig. 71)\r\nare large, elongate-oval, greenish in fresh preparations and vary in\r\nsize from 24 µ to 49 µ long and 12·8 µ to 28 µ broad, the gut forms\r\nbeing usually smaller than those occurring in the liver, owing to the\r\nmore confined space in which they are formed. Formerly, the parasites\r\nin the liver were described under the name of _Coccidium oviforme_,\r\nwhile those from the intestine were termed _Coccidium perforans_. This\r\ndistinction has now broken down.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71.--_Eimeria stiedæ_, from the liver of the\r\nrabbit, oöcysts in various stages of development. (After Leuckart.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.--_a_, _b_, spores of _Eimeria stiedæ_ (Riv.),\r\nwith two sporozoites and residual bodies; _c_ represents a free\r\nsporozoite. (After Balbiani.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73.--So-called swarm cysts (endogenous sporulation\r\nor schizogony) of the Coccidium of the rabbit. The daughter forms are\r\ncalled merozoites. (After R. Pfeiffer.)]\r\n\r\nThe oöcysts[176] are thick-walled, somewhat flattened at one pole,\r\nwhere a large micropyle is present. Four egg-shaped spores (sporocysts)\r\nare formed within, each about 12 µ to 15 µ long and 7 µ broad\r\n(fig. 72). The oöcysts are voided with the fæces. Sporogony takes,\r\nin nature, about three days in the excrement. Fæcal contamination of\r\nthe food of rabbits results, and coccidian oöcysts are swallowed.\r\nUnder the influence of the pancreatic juice of a new host, the\r\nsporozoites (fig. 72, _a_--_c_) are liberated from the spores and\r\nproceed to attack the epithelium and multiply within it, as in the\r\ncase of _Eimeria avium_. From the gut, infection spreads to the liver,\r\nwhere multiplication of the parasite goes on actively, resulting in\r\nthe formation of the whitish coccidial nodules, which may be very\r\nconspicuous (fig. 74). Proliferation of the connective tissue may occur\r\naround the coccidial nodules, which then contain large numbers of\r\noöcysts in various stages of development. It is said that the oöcysts\r\nin the older nodules do not seem to be capable of further development.\r\nSchizogony (fig. 73) and gametogony in all stages can be found in both\r\nliver and gut.\r\n\r\n[176] For an account of the life-cycle of _Eimeria stiedæ_ consult\r\nWasielewski, Th. von (1904), “Studien und Photogramme zur Kenntnis der\r\npathogenen Protozoen,” Heft. 1 (Coccidia), 118 pp., 7 plates, Leipzig:\r\nJ. A. Barth. Also, Metzner, R. (1903), _Arch. f. Protistenk._, ii,\r\np. 13.\r\n\r\nYoung rabbits often die of intestinal coccidiosis before infection of\r\nthe liver occurs. The repeated schizogony of _Eimeria stiedæ_ in the\r\ngut is sufficient to cause death.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.--_Eimeria stiedæ_. Section through coccidian\r\nnodule in infected rabbit’s liver. × 55.]\r\n\r\n  The disease of cattle popularly known as “red dysentery” is also\r\n  ascribed to the action of _Eimeria stiedæ_. The fæces of infected\r\n  cattle show blood clots of various sizes and in severe cases watery\r\n  diarrhœa is present. Acute cases end fatally in about two days.\r\n  Numerous oöcysts, considered to be those of _Eimeria stiedæ_, occur\r\n  in the fæces, and there is a heavy infection of the gut, especially\r\n  the large intestine and rectum, all stages of the parasite being\r\n  found in the epithelium. It is suspected that cattle contract the\r\n  disease by feeding on fresh grass contaminated with oöcysts. The\r\n  disease is recorded from Switzerland and from East Africa.\r\n\r\nAs before mentioned, _Eimeria stiedæ_ is considered to be the\r\norganism found in a few cases in man, possibly acquired by eating the\r\ninsufficiently cooked livers of diseased rabbits. These cases may now\r\nbe described.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) *Human Hepatic Coccidiosis.*\r\n\r\n  (1) Gubler’s Case. A stone-breaker, aged 45, was admitted to a Paris\r\n  hospital suffering from digestive disturbances and severe anæmia.\r\n  On examination the liver was found to be enlarged and presented a\r\n  prominent swelling, which was regarded as being due to Echinococcus.\r\n  At the autopsy of the man, who succumbed to intercurrent peritonitis,\r\n  twenty cysts were found averaging 2 to 3 cm. in diameter, and one\r\n  measuring 12 to 15 cm. The caseous contents consisted of detritus,\r\n  pus corpuscles, and oval-shelled formations, which were considered to\r\n  be Distoma eggs, but which, in accordance with Leuckart’s conjecture,\r\n  proved to be Coccidia.[177]\r\n\r\n[177] Gubler, A., “Tumeurs du foie déterm. par des œufs d’helm....”\r\n_Mem. Soc. Biol._, Paris, 1858, v, 2; and _Gaz. med. de Paris_, 1858,\r\np. 657; Leuckart, R., _Die menschl. Paras._, 1863, 1ST edition, i,\r\npp. 49, 740.\r\n\r\n  (2) Dressler’s Case (Prague). Relates to three cysts, varying from\r\n  the size of a hemp-seed to that of a pea, and containing Coccidia,\r\n  found in a man’s liver.[178]\r\n\r\n[178] Leuckart, R., _Die menschl. Paras._, 1863, 1st edition, i, p. 740.\r\n\r\n  (3) Sattler’s Case (Vienna). Coccidia were in this case observed in\r\n  the dilated biliary duct of a human liver.[179]\r\n\r\n[179] Leuckart, R., _Die Paras. d. mensch._, 1879, 2nd edition, p. 281.\r\n\r\n  (4) Perls’ Case (Giessen). Perls discovered Coccidia in an old\r\n  preparation of Sömmering’s agglomerations.[180]\r\n\r\n[180] Leuckart, R., _ibid._, p. 282.\r\n\r\n  (5) Silcock’s Case (London).[181] The patient, aged 50, who had\r\n  fallen ill with serious symptoms, exhibited fever, enlarged liver\r\n  and spleen, and had a dry, coated tongue. At the autopsy numerous\r\n  caseous centres, mostly immediately beneath the surface, were found,\r\n  while the contiguous parts of the liver were inflamed. Microscopical\r\n  examination demonstrated numerous Coccidia in the hepatic cells as\r\n  well as in the epithelium of the biliary ducts. A deposit of Coccidia\r\n  was likewise found in the spleen, which the parasites had probably\r\n  reached by means of the blood-stream.[182]\r\n\r\n[181] Silcock, “A Case of Parasit. by Psorospermia,” _Trans. Path.\r\nSoc._, London, 1890, xli, p. 320.\r\n\r\n[182] Pianese has confirmed the fact that Coccidia actually occur in\r\nthe blood of the hepatic veins of infected rabbits.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) *Human Intestinal Coccidiosis.*\r\n\r\n  In two cadavers at the Pathological Institute in Berlin, Eimer[183]\r\n  found the epithelium of the intestine permeated by Coccidia. Railliet\r\n  and Lucet’s case may be traced back to intestinal Coccidia, which\r\n  were found in the fæces of a woman and her child, who had both\r\n  suffered for some time from chronic diarrhœa.[184] In other cases\r\n  (Grassi, Rivolta), where only the existence of Coccidia in the fæces\r\n  was known, it is doubtful whether the parasites originated in the\r\n  intestine or in the liver.\r\n\r\n[183] _Die ei- u. kugelf. Psorosp. d. Wirbelt._, 1870, p. 16.\r\n\r\n[184] Railliet and Lucet, “Obs. s. quelq. Cocc. intest.,” _C. R. Soc.\r\nBiol._, Paris, 1890, p. 660; Railliet, _Trait. Zool. med. et agric._,\r\n2e éd., 1895, p. 140.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) *Doubtful Cases.*\r\n\r\n  To these belong Virchow’s case[185] where, in the liver of an elderly\r\n  woman, a thick walled tumour measuring 9 to 11 mm. was found.\r\n  Among the contents of this tumour there were oval formations 56 µ\r\n  long, surrounded by two membranes and enclosing a number of round\r\n  substances. Virchow considered these foreign bodies to be eggs of\r\n  pentastomes in various stages of development, others consider them to\r\n  be Coccidia.\r\n\r\n[185] _Arch. f. path. An._, xviii, 1860, p. 523.\r\n\r\n  The Coccidia which Podwyssotzki claims to have seen in the liver of\r\n  a man, not only in the liver cells, but also in the nuclei, are also\r\n  problematic.[186] The parasite was called _Caryophagus hominis_.\r\n\r\n[186] Podwyssotzki, “Ueb. d. Bedeut. d. Coccid. in d. Path. Leber des\r\nMenschen,” _Centralbl. f. Bakt._, vi, 1889, p. 41.\r\n\r\n  Again, other explanations can be given to an observation by Thomas,\r\n  on the occurrence of _Coccidium oviforme_ in a cerebral tumour of a\r\n  woman aged 40. The growth was as large as a pea and surrounded by a\r\n  bony substance.[187]\r\n\r\n[187] Thomas, J., “Case of Bone Formation in the Human Brain, due to\r\nthe Presence of _Coccidium oviforme_,” _Journal Boston Soc. Med. Sc._,\r\niii, 1899, p. 167; _Centralbl. f. Bakt._ [I] xxviii, 1900, p. 882.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Isospora*, Aimé Schneider, 1881.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Diplospora_, Labbé, 1893.\r\n\r\nBelonging to the section _Disporea_, that is, forming only two spores,\r\neach with four sporozoites.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Isospora bigemina*, Stiles, 1891.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: “_Cytospermium villorum intestinalium canis et felis_,”\r\n  Rivolta, 1874; “_Coccidium Rivolta_,” Grassi, 1882; _Coccidium\r\n  bigeminum_, Stiles, 1891.\r\n\r\nThis parasite lives in the intestinal villi of dogs, cats, and the\r\npolecat (_Mustela putorius_, L.). According to Stiles,[188] the oöcyst\r\ndivides into two equal ellipsoidal portions or sporoblasts which\r\nbecome spores and then each forms four sporozoites. The oöcysts of\r\nthis species vary from 22 µ to 40 µ in length and from 19 µ to 28 µ in\r\nbreadth. Each spore is 10 µ to 18 µ long and contains four sporozoites.\r\nThe parasites live and multiply, not only in the gut epithelium, but\r\nalso in the connective tissue of the intestinal submucosa. Wasielewski\r\nhas seen merozoites in the gut of the cat.\r\n\r\n[188] “Notes on Paras.,” No. II, _Journ. of Comp. Med. and Vet. Sci._,\r\n1892, xiii, p. 517.\r\n\r\n_Isospora bigemina_ (fig. 75) appears to occur also in man, for Virchow\r\npublished a case which was communicated to him by Kjellberg, and\r\nattributed the illness to this parasite.[189] Possibly also it would be\r\nmore correct to ascribe the observation of Railliet and Lucet, which\r\nis mentioned under “Human Intestinal Coccidiosis,” p. 148, to this\r\nspecies, as the Coccidia in that case were distinguished by their\r\ndiminutive size (length 15 µ, breadth 10 µ). The case communicated by\r\nGrunow may also possibly refer to _Isospora bigemina_.[190] Roundish\r\nor oval structures of 6 µ to 13 µ in diameter occurred in the mucous\r\nmembrane of the gut and in the fæces of a case of enteritis.\r\n\r\n[189] _Arch. f. path. An._, 1860, xviii, p. 527.\r\n\r\n[190] Grunow, “Ein Fall von Protozoën (Coccidien?) Erkrankung des\r\nDarmes,” _Arch. f. exper.

(After Stiles.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nDOUBTFUL SPECIES.\r\n\r\n  In literature many other statements are found as to the occurrence\r\n  of Coccidia-like organisms in different diseases of man. In some\r\n  of the cases the parasites proved to be fungi. This was the case\r\n  with the parasites of a severe skin disease of man, formerly called\r\n  _Coccidioides immitis_ and _Coccidioides pyogenes_. Other statements\r\n  are founded on misapprehensions, or are still much disputed. If\r\n  reference is here made to “_Eimeria hominis_,” R. Blanchard, 1895,\r\n  this is done on the authority of the investigator mentioned. The\r\n  structures in question are nucleated spindle-shaped bodies of very\r\n  different lengths (18 µ to 100 µ), which either occurred isolated or\r\n  were enclosed in large globular or oval cysts, alone or with a larger\r\n  tuberculated body (“residual body”). These formations were found by\r\n  J. Künstler and A. Pitres in the pleural exudation removed from a man\r\n  by tapping. The man was employed on the ships plying between Bordeaux\r\n  and the Senegal River.\r\n\r\n  Blanchard looks upon the fusiform bodies as merozoites and the cysts\r\n  as schizonts of a Coccidium. On the other hand, Moniez declares the\r\n  spindle bodies to be the ova and the supposed residual bodies to be\r\n  “floating ovaries” of an Echinorhynchus.\r\n\r\n  Severi’s “monocystid Gregarines,” which were taken from the lung\r\n  tissue of a still-born child, are also quite problematical.\r\n\r\n  No less doubtful are the bodies which Perroncito calls _Coccidium\r\n  jalinum_, and which he found in severe diseases of the intestine in\r\n  human beings, pigs, and guinea-pigs; Borini also reported another\r\n  case.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder. *Hæmosporidia*, Danilewsky emend. Schaudinn.\r\n\r\nThe Hæmosporidia are a group of blood parasites, comprising forms\r\ndiffering greatly among themselves. Some of the forms need much further\r\ninvestigation. However, there are certain true Hæmosporidia which\r\npresent close affinities with the Coccidia, leading Doflein to use the\r\nterm *Coccidiomorpha* for the two orders conjoined.\r\n\r\nThe Hæmosporidia present the following general characteristics:--\r\n\r\n(1) They are parasites of either red or white blood corpuscles of\r\nvertebrates during one period of their life-history.\r\n\r\n(2) They exhibit alternation of generations--asexual phases or\r\nschizogony alternating with sexual phases or sporogony--as do the\r\nCoccidia.\r\n\r\n(3) There is also an alternation of hosts in those cases which have so\r\nfar been completely investigated. The schizogony occurs in the blood or\r\ninternal organs of some vertebrates while the sporogony occurs in an\r\ninvertebrate, such as a blood-sucking arthropod or leech.\r\n\r\n(4) Unlike the Coccidia, resistant spores in sporocysts are not\r\ngenerally produced, such protective phases in the life-cycle being\r\nunnecessary, as the Hæmosporidia are contained within either the\r\nvertebrate or invertebrate host during the whole of their life.\r\n\r\nThe Hæmosporidia may be considered for convenience under five main\r\ntypes:--\r\n\r\n(1) The _Plasmodium_ or _Hæmamœba_ type. This includes the malarial\r\nparasites of man and of birds. The asexual multiplicative or\r\nschizogonic phases occur inside red blood corpuscles and are amœboid.\r\nThey produce distinctive, darkish pigment termed melanin or hæmozoin.\r\nInfected blood drawn and cooled on a slide may exhibit “exflagellation”\r\nof the male gametocytes, _i.e._, the formation of filamentous male\r\ngametes. The invertebrate host is a mosquito. The malarial parasites\r\nof man are discussed at length on p. 155. Similar pigmented hæmamœboid\r\nparasites have been described in antelopes, dogs, and other mammals,\r\nand even reptiles.\r\n\r\n(2) The _Halteridium_ type. The trophozoite stage inside the red blood\r\ncorpuscle is halter-shaped. Pigment is produced, especially near the\r\nends of the organism. The parasites occur in the blood of birds. The\r\ninvertebrate host of _H. columbæ_ of pigeons in Europe, Africa, Brazil\r\nand India, is a hippoboscid fly, belonging to the genus _Lynchia_.\r\n\r\nHalteridium parasites are common in the blood of passerine birds,\r\nsuch as pigeons, finches, stone owls, Java sparrows, parrots, etc.\r\nThe Halteridium embraces or grows around the nucleus of the host red\r\ncell without displacing the nucleus. Young forms and multiplicative\r\nstages of _H. columbæ_ have been found in leucocytes in the lungs of\r\nthe pigeon (fig. 76, _8_-_12_). Male and female forms (gametocytes)\r\nare seen in the blood (fig. 76, _3a_, _3b_). The cytoplasm of the\r\nmale gametocytes is pale-staining and the nucleus is elongate, while\r\nthe cytoplasm of the females is darker and the nucleus is smaller and\r\nround. Formation of male gametes from male gametocytes (the so-called\r\nprocess of “exflagellation”) may occur on a slide of drawn infected\r\nblood, also fertilization, and formation of the oökinete, as first seen\r\nby MacCallum. The correct generic name for Halteridia is, apparently,\r\n_Hæmoproteus_. Wasielewski (1913), working on _H. danilewskyi_ (var.\r\n_falconis_), in kestrels, finds that the halteridium may be pathogenic\r\nto nestlings. The cycle of _H. noctuæ_ described by Schaudinn (1904)\r\nlacks confirmation. The account of the life-cycle of _H. columbæ_ given\r\nby Aragão (1908) is illustrated in fig. 76. It agrees with the work of\r\nSergent (1906–7) and Gonder (1915). Mrs. Adie (1915) states that the\r\ncycle in _Lynchia_ is like that of a _Plasmodium_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76--_Hæmoproteus_ (_Halteridium_) _columbæ_.\r\nLife-cycle diagram: 1, 2, stages in red blood corpuscle of bird; 3,\r\n4, gametocytes (3_a_ ♂, 3b ♀); 5_a_, formation of microgametes; 6,\r\nfertilization (in fly’s gut); 7, oökinete; 8–12, stages in mononuclear\r\nleucocytes in lungs. (After Aragão.)]\r\n\r\n(3) The _Leucocytozoön_ type. The trophozoites and gametocytes occur\r\nwithin mononuclear leucocytes and young red cells (erythroblasts) in\r\nthe blood of birds. Laveran and França consider that the Leucocytozoa\r\noccur in erythrocytes. The host cells are often greatly altered by\r\nthe parasites, becoming hypertrophied and the ends usually drawn into\r\nhorn-like processes (fig. 77), though some remain rounded. Leucocytozoa\r\nare limited to birds, and very rarely produce pigment. Male and female\r\nforms (gametocytes) are distinguishable in the blood (fig. 77), and the\r\nformation of male gametes (“exflagellation”) may occur in drawn blood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.--_Leucocytozoön lovati_. _a_, Male parasite\r\n(microgametocyte), within host cell, whose ends are drawn out; _b_,\r\nfemale parasite (macrogametocyte) from blood of grouse. × 1,800. (After\r\nFantham.)]\r\n\r\nThe Leucocytozoa were first seen by Danilewsky in 1884. They are\r\nusually oval or spherical. It is not easy sometimes to distinguish the\r\naltered host cell from the parasite, as the nucleus of the former is\r\npushed to one side by the leucocytozoön. The cytoplasm of the female\r\nparasite stains deeply, and the nucleus is rather small, containing a\r\nkaryosome. In the male the cytoplasm stains lightly and the nucleus is\r\nlarger, with a loose, granular structure.\r\n\r\nMany species of Leucocytozoa are recorded, but schizogony has only\r\nbeen described by Fantham (1910)[191] in _L. lovati_ in the spleen of\r\nthe grouse (_Lagopus scoticus_), and by Moldovan[192] (1913) in _L.\r\nziemanni_ in the internal organs of screech-owls.\r\n\r\n[191] _Annals Trop. Med. and Parasitol._, iv, p. 255.\r\n\r\n[192] _Centralbl. f. Bakt._, Orig., lxxi, p. 66.\r\n\r\nM. and A. Leger[193] (1914) propose to classify Leucocytozoa,\r\nprovisionally, according as the host cells are fusiform or rounded.\r\n\r\n[193] _Bull. Soc. Path. Exot._, vii, p. 437.\r\n\r\n(4) The _Hæmogregarina_ type. Included herein are many parasites of red\r\nblood corpuscles, with a few (the leucocytogregarines) parasitic in the\r\nwhite cells of certain mammals and a few birds. They are not amœboid\r\nbut gregarine-like, vermicular or sausage-shaped (fig. 78). They do\r\nnot produce pigment. They are widely distributed among the vertebrata,\r\nbut are most numerous in cold-blooded vertebrates (fishes, amphibia\r\nand reptiles). The hæmogregarines of aquatic hosts are transmitted by\r\nleeches, those of terrestrial hosts by arthropods.\r\n\r\nThe nucleus of hæmogregarines is usually near the middle of the\r\nparasite, but may be situated nearer one end. The body of the\r\nparasite may be lodged in a capsule (“cytocyst”). There is much\r\nvariation in size and appearance among hæmogregarines. Some are\r\nsmall (_Lankesterella_); some attack the nucleus of the host cell\r\n(_Karyolysus_); others have full grown vermicules larger than the\r\ncontaining host corpuscle, and so the hæmogregarines bend on themselves\r\nin the form of *U* (fig. 78, _b_). Schizogony often occurs\r\nin the internal organs of the host, sometimes in the circulating blood.\r\n\r\nThe hæmogregarines occurring in the white cells (mononuclears or\r\npolymorphonuclears) of mammals have been referred to a separate\r\ngenus, _Leucocytogregarina_ (Porter) or _Hepatozoön_ (Miller). Such\r\nleucocytogregarines are known in the dog (fig. 79), rat, mouse,\r\npalm-squirrel, rabbit, cat, etc. Schizogony of these forms occurs in\r\nthe internal organs, such as the liver, lung and bone-marrow of the\r\nhosts. They are apparently transmitted by ectoparasitic arthropods,\r\nsuch as ticks, mites, and lice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.--Hæmogregarines from lizards, _a_, _H.\r\nschaudinni_, var. _africana_, from _Lacerta ocellata_; _b_, _H. nobrei_\r\nfrom _Lacerta muralis_; _c_, _H. marceaui_ in cytocyst, from _Lacerta\r\nmuralis_. (After França.)]\r\n\r\nA few hæmogregarines are known to be parasitic in the red blood\r\ncorpuscles of mammals. Such are _H. gerbilli_ in the Indian field rat,\r\n_Gerbillus indicus_; _H. balfouri_ (_jaculi_) in the jerboa, _Jaculus\r\njaculus_, and a few species briefly described from marsupials. These\r\nparasites do not form pigment.\r\n\r\nStrict leucocytic gregarines have been described from a few birds by\r\nAragão and by Todd.\r\n\r\nThe sporogony of hæmogregarines is only known in a few cases, and\r\nin those affinity with the Coccidia is exhibited. In fact, the\r\nHæmogregarines are now classified by some authors with the Coccidia.\r\n\r\n(5) The _Babesia_ or _Piroplasma_ type. These are small parasites of\r\nred blood corpuscles of mammals. They do not produce pigment. They\r\nare pear-shaped, round or amœboid in Babesia, bacilliform and oval\r\nin other forms referred to this group. Piroplasms are transmitted by\r\nticks. These parasites are described at length on p. 172.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79.--_Leucocytogregarina canis_. Life-cycle\r\ndiagram. Constructed from drawings by Christophers. (After Castellani\r\nand Chalmers.) Schizogony occurs in the bone-marrow.

It has been known since ancient times and is\r\ndistributed over almost all the world, although very unevenly, but does\r\nnot occur in waterless deserts and the Polar regions. In many places,\r\nespecially in the civilized countries of Central Europe, the disease\r\nis extinct or occurs only sporadically, and large tracts of land have\r\nbecome free from malaria.\r\n\r\nThe rhythmical course of the fever is characteristic. It begins\r\napparently suddenly with chilliness or typical shivering, whilst the\r\ntemperature of the body rises, the pulse becomes low and tense and the\r\nnumber of beats of the pulse increases considerably. After half to\r\ntwo hours the heat stage begins. The patient himself feels the rise\r\nof his temperature (shown by feeling of heat, dry tongue, headache,\r\nthirst). The temperature may reach 41°C or more. At the same time there\r\nis sensitiveness in the region of the spleen and enlargement of that\r\norgan. After four to six hours an improvement takes place, and with\r\nprofuse perspiration the body temperature falls rapidly, not often\r\nbelow normal. After the attack the patient feels languid, but otherwise\r\nwell until certain prodromal symptoms (heaviness in the body, headache)\r\nwhich were not noticed at first, denote the approach of another attack\r\nof fever, which proceeds in the same way.\r\n\r\nThe intervals between the attacks are of varying length which permit of\r\na distinction in the kinds of fever. If the attacks intermit one day,\r\noccurring on the first, third and fifth days of the illness and always\r\nat the same time of day, it is termed _febris tertiana_; if two days\r\noccur between fever days, it is called _febris quartana_. In the case\r\nof the fever recurring daily, later writers speak of typical _febris\r\nquotidiana_. But a quotidian fever may arise when two tertian fevers\r\ndiffering by about twenty-four hours exist at the same time (_febris\r\ntertiana duplex_). The patient has a daily attack, but the fever of the\r\nfirst, third and fifth days differs in some point (hour of occurrence,\r\nheight of temperature, duration of cold or hot stage) from the fever\r\nof the second, fourth and sixth days. Similarly, two or three quartan\r\nfevers which differ by about twenty-four hours each may be observed\r\ntogether (_febris quartana duplex_ or _triplex_); in the latter case\r\nthe result is also a quotidian fever.\r\n\r\nTwo kinds of tertian fever are differentiated--a milder form occurring\r\nespecially in the spring (spring tertian fever), and a more severe form\r\nappearing in the summer and autumn in warmer districts, especially in\r\nthe tropics (_summer or autumn fever_, _febris æstivo-autumnalis_,\r\n_febris tropica_, _febris perniciosa_). The latter often becomes a\r\nquotidian fever.\r\n\r\nAll the afore-mentioned infections are termed acute. They are\r\ndistinguished from the very different _chronic malarial infection_ by\r\nthe frequent occurrence of relapses, which finally lead to changes\r\nof some organs and particularly of the blood. The relapses are then\r\ngenerally marked by an irregular course of fever.\r\n\r\nThe term masked malaria is used when any disturbance of the state\r\nof health of a periodic character shows itself and disappears after\r\ntreatment with quinine.[194] Generally it is a question of neuralgia.\r\n\r\n[194] Quinine is still almost exclusively the remedy used in the\r\ntreatment of malaria. It is prepared from the bark of the cinchona\r\ntree. This important remedy was introduced into Europe in 1640 from\r\nEcuador by Juan del Vego, physician of the Countess del Cinchon.\r\n\r\n  That intermittent fever was an infectious disease, although\r\n  not one which was transmitted direct from man to man, had been\r\n  assumed for a long time. Therefore it was natural, at a time when\r\n  bacteriology was triumphing, to look for a living agent causing\r\n  infection in malaria, which search was, seemingly, successful (Klebs,\r\n  Tomasi-Crudeli, 1879). Hence it was not surprising that the discovery\r\n  of the real malarial parasites in November, 1880, by the military\r\n  doctor A. Laveran[195] in Constantine (Algeria), at first met with\r\n  violent opposition, even after Richard (1882) had confirmed it and\r\n  Marchiafava, Celli, Grassi and others, had further extended it.\r\n  Not that the existence of structures found in the blood of malaria\r\n  patients by Laveran and Richard was denied; on the contrary, the\r\n  investigations of the opponents furnished many valuable discoveries,\r\n  but the organisms were differently interpreted and considered to be\r\n  degeneration products of red blood corpuscles. Only when Marchiafava\r\n  and Celli (1885) saw movements in the parasites, which Laveran called\r\n  _Oscillaria malariæ_ and later _Hæmatozoön malariæ_, was their animal\r\n  nature admitted and the parasites were named _Plasmodium malariæ_.\r\n  Shortly before this, Gerhardt (1884) had stated that the disease\r\n  could be transmitted by the injection of the blood of a malarial\r\n  patient to a healthy person.\r\n\r\n[195] The discovery of Laveran is in no way lessened by the fact that\r\none investigator or another (according to Blanchard [_Arch. de Paras._,\r\nvii, 1903, p. 152], P. F. H. Klencke in 1843) had seen, mentioned and\r\ndepicted malarial parasites. (_Neue phys. Abhandl. auf. selbständ.\r\nBeob. gegr._, Leipzig, 1843, p. 163, fig. 25). In 1847 Meckel had\r\nrecognized that the dark colour of the organs in persons dead of\r\nmalaria was due to pigment. Virchow in 1848 stated that this pigment\r\noccurred in blood cells. Kelsch in 1875 recognized the frequency of\r\nmelaniferous leucocytes in the blood of malarial patients. Beauperthuy\r\n(1853) noticed that in Guadeloupe there was no malaria at altitudes\r\nwhere there were no “insectes tipulaires,” and suggested that the\r\ndisease was inoculated by insects.\r\n\r\n  This supplied the starting point for further investigations, which\r\n  were made not exclusively, but principally, by Italian investigators\r\n  (Golgi, Marchiafava and Celli, Bignami and Bastianelli, Grassi and\r\n  Feletti, Mannaberg, Romanowsky, Osier, Thayer and others). In 1885\r\n  Golgi described the asexual cycle in the blood, in the case of the\r\n  quartan parasite. These investigations, after attention had been\r\n  drawn by Danilewsky (1890) to the occurrence of similar endoglobular\r\n  parasites in birds, were extended to the latter (Grassi and Feletti,\r\n  Celli and Sanfelice, Kruse, Labbé and others).\r\n\r\n  The result was as follows: Malaria in man (and birds) is the result\r\n  of peculiar parasites included in the _Sporozoa_ by Metchnikoff,\r\n  which parasites live in the erythrocytes, grow in size and finally\r\n  “sporulate,” that is, separate into a number of “spores” which leave\r\n  the erythrocytes and infect other blood corpuscles. Morphologically\r\n  and biologically several species (and respectively several varieties)\r\n  of malarial parasites may be distinguished, on which the different\r\n  intermittent forms depend. Transmission of the blood of patients to\r\n  healthy people produces a malarial affection which corresponds in\r\n  character to the fever of the patient from whom the inoculation was\r\n  made. The combined types of fever (tertiana duplex, quartana duplex\r\n  or triplex) are explained by the fact that the patient harbours\r\n  two or three groups of parasites which differ in their development\r\n  by about twenty-four hours, whilst the irregular fevers depend on\r\n  deviation from the typical course of development of the parasites. In\r\n  addition to stages of the parasites which could easily be arranged\r\n  in a developmental series concurrent with the course of the disease,\r\n  other phases of the parasites also became known, such as spheres,\r\n  crescents, polymitus forms, which seemed not to be included in the\r\n  series and, therefore, were very differently interpreted.\r\n\r\n  The decision reached at the beginning of the last decade of the\r\n  last century, which found expression in comprehensive statements\r\n  (Mannaberg, Ziemann and others), only concerned a part of the\r\n  complete development of the malarial parasites. No one could with\r\n  any degree of certainty demonstrate how man became infected, nor\r\n  were there reliable hypotheses based on analogy with other parasites\r\n  concerning the exit of the excitants of malaria from the infected\r\n  person and their further behaviour. Numerous hypotheses had been\r\n  advanced, but none was able to elucidate the various observations\r\n  made from time to time in dealing with malaria. One hypothesis only\r\n  seemed to have a better foundation. Manson (1894), who knew from\r\n  his own experience the part played by mosquitoes in the development\r\n  of Filaria from the blood of man, applied this also to the malarial\r\n  parasites living in the blood, whereby at least the way was indicated\r\n  by which the Hæmosporidia could leave man. The parasites were said\r\n  finally to get into water through mosquitoes which had sucked the\r\n  blood of malarial patients, and the germ spread thence to men who\r\n  drank the water. In some cases the parasites were supposed to reach\r\n  man by the inhaling of the dust of dried marshes. On the other\r\n  hand, Bignami believed that the mosquitoes were infected in the\r\n  open air by malarial parasites which occurred there in an unknown\r\n  stage and the insects transmitted the germs to man when biting. R.\r\n  Koch combined both hypotheses, without, however, producing positive\r\n  proof. R. Ross, then (1897–8) an English military doctor in India,\r\n  was the first to succeed in this. He had been encouraged by Manson\r\n  to study the fate of malarial _Plasmodia_ which had entered the\r\n  intestine of mosquitoes with malaria-infected blood, especially in\r\n  the case of the _Plasmodium_ (_Proteosoma_) living in the blood of\r\n  birds. He showed that the _Proteosoma_ penetrate the intestinal wall\r\n  of the mosquitoes, grow and develop into large cysts which produce\r\n  innumerable rod-like germs, which burst into the body cavity and\r\n  penetrate the salivary glands. Ross allowed mosquitoes to suck the\r\n  blood of birds affected by malaria, and some nine days later, let\r\n  the infected mosquitoes which had been isolated suck healthy birds.\r\n  After five to nine days _Proteosoma_ were found to occur in the blood\r\n  of the birds used. The _Proteosoma_ and _Halteridium_ of birds were\r\n  also further investigated by MacCallum (1897–8), Koch and others, and\r\n  important results followed.\r\n\r\n  In any case Ross (1898) had clearly established the importance\r\n  of mosquitoes in the spread of malaria among birds. It was now\r\n  only a question of proving whether, and how far, mosquitoes were\r\n  concerned with human malaria. Ross himself worked to this end. Here\r\n  the experiments of Italian investigators (Bignami, Bastianelli,\r\n  Grassi)[196] were of importance. These investigators studied the fate\r\n  of malarial parasites in man, produced malaria in men experimentally\r\n  by the bites of infected mosquitoes, and established that only\r\n  mosquitoes belonging to the genus _Anopheles_ were concerned, and\r\n  not species of _Culex_. These latter are only able to transmit\r\n  _Proteosoma_ to birds. It is true that _Culex_ can ingest the\r\n  human malarial parasites, but the latter do not develop in them.\r\n  Development only occurs in species of _Anopheles_. In _Anopheles_\r\n  (and similarly for _Proteosoma_ in _Culex_) sexual reproduction takes\r\n  place; crescents, spheres and polymitus forms are necessary stages of\r\n  development in the mosquito.\r\n\r\n[196] Grassi, B. (1901), “Die Malaria,” 250 pp., 8 plates. G. Fischer,\r\nJena.\r\n\r\n  With these discoveries the campaign against malaria became more\r\n  definite. It was directed partly against the transmitters, whose\r\n  biology and life-cycle were more thoroughly investigated, instead of\r\n  merely against the infection of the adult _Anopheles_. The latter do\r\n  not, as was believed for some time, transmit the malarial germs to\r\n  their offspring. They always infect themselves from human beings,\r\n  whereby the relapses appearing in early summer, and the latent\r\n  infection, especially of children of natives, play a principal part\r\n  (Stephens and Christophers, Koch). Further, the crusade was directed\r\n  against the infection of man by the bites of _Anopheles_. Important\r\n  results have been obtained in these directions. Low and Sambon in\r\n  1900 lived in a mosquito-screened hut in a malarial part of the\r\n  Roman Campagna for three of the most malarious months and did not\r\n  contract the disease. In the same year Dr. P. T. Manson was infected\r\n  with malaria by infected mosquitoes sent from Italy. The rôle of\r\n  mosquitoes having been proved, it may be hoped that ultimately the\r\n  eradication of malaria, or at least a considerable restriction of it,\r\n  will be achieved.\r\n\r\n  It is of importance to record that, although malarial parasites occur\r\n  in mammals (monkeys, bats, etc.) the human ones are not transmissible\r\n  to mammals, not even to monkeys. The species, therefore, are specific\r\n  to the different hosts (Dionisi, Kossel, Ziemann, Vassall).\r\n\r\n  An important work dealing with the modern applications of the\r\n  mosquito-malaria theory in all parts of the Tropics was published by\r\n  Sir Ronald Ross in 1911. It is entitled “The Prevention of Malaria”\r\n  (John Murray, London, 21s.).\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF THE MALARIAL PARASITES OF MAN.\r\n\r\nThe commencement of the developmental cycle and of the infection of\r\nman, is the sporozoites (fig. 80, _1_) which are passed into the\r\nblood of a person by the bite of an infected mosquito. Prior to this\r\nthe parasites collect in the excretory ducts of the salivary glands\r\n(fig. 80, _27_) of the _Anopheles_. The sporozoites are elongate\r\nand spindle-shaped, 10 µ to 20 µ long and 1 µ to 2 µ broad, with an\r\noval nucleus situated in the middle. They are able to glide, perform\r\nperistaltic contractions, or curve laterally. Schaudinn has studied\r\nthe penetration of the red blood corpuscles (fig. 80, _2_) by the\r\nsporozoites in the case of the living tertian parasite. The process\r\ntakes forty to sixty minutes in drawn blood. After its entrance the\r\nparasite, which is now called a trophozoite, contracts, and becomes an\r\nactive amœbula (fig. 80, _3_). It develops a food vacuole and grows at\r\nthe expense of the invaded blood corpuscle (fig. 80, _4_), which is\r\nshown by the appearance of pigment granules (transformed hæmoglobin)\r\nin it. When the maximum size is attained, multiplication by schizogony\r\n(fig. 80, _5_-_7_) begins with a division of the nucleus, which is\r\nfollowed by further divisions of the daughter nuclei, the number of\r\nwhich varies up to 16 or even 32, depending on the species of the\r\nparasite. Then the cytoplasm divides into as many portions as there\r\nare nuclei, the result being a structure suggestive of the spokes of a\r\nwheel or of a daisy, the centre of the resulting rosette being occupied\r\nby dark pigment. Finally, the parts separate from one another, leaving\r\nbehind a residual body containing the pigment, and the daughter forms\r\nissue into the blood plasma as merozoites (fig. 80, _7_). They are\r\nactively amœboid (fig. 80, _8_) and soon begin to enter other blood\r\ncorpuscles of their host, for the entry into which thirty to sixty\r\nminutes are necessary, according to Schaudinn’s observations.[197]\r\n\r\n[197] It should be remembered that some authors (Laveran, Argutinsky,\r\nPanichi, Serra) argue against the intra-globular position of\r\nmalarial parasites and state that they only adhere outwardly to\r\nthe red blood corpuscles. These views have recently been revived\r\nby Mary Rowley-Lawson, and she states that the malarial parasite\r\nis “extracellular throughout its life-cycle and migrates from red\r\ncorpuscle to red corpuscle destroying each before it abandons it.”\r\n(_Journ. Exper. Med._, 1914, xix, p. 531.)\r\n\r\nHere they behave like sporozoites which previously entered and again\r\nproduce merozoites. This process is repeated until the number of\r\nparasites is so large that, at the next migration of the merozoites,\r\nthe body of the person infected reacts with an attack of fever,[198]\r\nwhich is repeated with the occurrence of the next or following\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\n[198] The incubation period, that is, the time between infection\r\nand the first attack of fever, is ten to fourteen days; with severe\r\ninfection fewer days (minimum 5 to 6) are needed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80.--Life-cycle of the tertian parasite\r\n(_Plasmodium vivax_).

If macrogametocytes (12_a_) do not get into the intestine of\r\n_Anopheles_ they may perhaps increase parthenogenetically according\r\nto Schaudinn (12_a_; 13_c_-17_c_). The merozoites which have arisen\r\n(17_c_) become schizonts 3–7. The phases shown underneath the dotted\r\nline (13–17) proceed in the stomach of _Anopheles_. 13_b_ and 14_b_,\r\nformation of microgametes; 13_a_ and 14_a_, maturation of the\r\nmacrogametes; 15_b_, microgamete; 16, fertilization; 17, oökinete; 18,\r\noökinete in the walls of the stomach; 19, penetration of the epithelium\r\nof the stomach; 20–25, stages of sporogony on the outer surface of\r\nthe intestinal wall; 26, migration of the sporozoites to the salivary\r\ngland; 27, salivary gland with sporozoites.]\r\n\r\nThe growth and schizogony last different times, according to the\r\nspecies of the parasite, about forty-eight hours in the case of the\r\nparasite of febris tertiana or tropica, and seventy-two hours for the\r\nquartan parasite. The various intermittent forms produced by them\r\ndepend on this specific difference in the malarial parasites.\r\n\r\nThe schizogony can, however, only be repeated a certain number of\r\ntimes, supposing that the disease has not been checked prematurely by\r\nthe administration of quinine, which is able to kill the parasites.\r\nIt appears that after a number of attacks of fever the conditions of\r\nexistence in man are unfavourable for the malarial parasites, and\r\nthis brings about the production of other forms which have long been\r\nknown, but also long misunderstood (spheres, crescents, polymitus). The\r\nmerozoites in this case no longer grow into schizonts, or at least not\r\nall of them, but become sexual individuals called gametocytes (fig. 80,\r\n_9_-_12_), which only start their further development when they have\r\nreached the intestine of _Anopheles_. This does not take place in\r\nevery case, nor with all the gametocytes which exist in the blood of\r\npatients with intermittent fever. Of those parasites which remain in\r\nthe human blood the male ones (microgametocytes) soon perish, the\r\nfemales (macrogametocytes) persist for some long time, and perhaps at\r\nlast acquire the capacity of increasing by schizogony. They might thus\r\nform merozoites which behave in the body as if they had proceeded from\r\nordinary schizonts (fig. 80, _13c_-_17c_). If their number increases\r\nsufficiently, in course of time the patient, who was apparently\r\nrecovering, has a new series of fever attacks, or relapses, without\r\nthere having been a new infection. This is the view of Schaudinn, who\r\nfrom researches of his own concluded that relapses were brought about\r\nby a sort of parthenogenetic reproduction of macrogametocytes. R. Ross,\r\non the contrary, believes that in the relatively healthy periods the\r\nnumber of parasites in the blood falls below that necessary to provoke\r\nfebrile symptoms; relapses then result merely from increase in the\r\nnumbers of the parasites present in the individual. Ross’s view is now\r\ngenerally accepted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81.--Stages of development of pernicious\r\nor malignant tertian parasites in the intestine of _Anopheles\r\nmacultpennis_.

(After Grassi.)]\r\n\r\nIf the gametocytes, which are globular, or in the pernicious or\r\nmalignant tertian parasite crescentic (fig. 81), gain access to the\r\nintestine of an Anopheline,[199] they mature. The macrogametocytes\r\nextrude a part of their nuclear substance (fig. 80, _13a_, _14a_) and\r\nthereby become females or macrogametes. The microgametocytes, on the\r\nother hand, undergo repeated nuclear division, preparation for this\r\nbeing made apparently whilst in the blood of man. This results in the\r\nformation of threadlike bodies which move like flagella and finally\r\ndetach themselves from the residual body (fig. 80, _13b_, _14b_). These\r\nare the males or microgametes[200] (fig. 80, _15b_).\r\n\r\n[199] Schizonts ingested about the same time perish in the intestine of\r\nthe mosquito.\r\n\r\n[200] If the microgametocytes are sufficiently mature the formation of\r\nmicrogametes occurs in the blood of man as soon as it is taken from the\r\nblood-vessel and has been cooled and diluted. Such a stage is called a\r\n_Polymitus_ form, and the process has been called “exflagellation.”\r\n\r\nCopulation takes place in the stomach of the Anopheline (fig. 80,\r\n_16_). A microgamete penetrates a macrogamete and coalesces with it.\r\nThe fertilized females elongate very soon and are called oökinetes\r\nor “vermicules” (figs. 80, _17_; 82). They penetrate the walls of the\r\nstomach, pierce the epithelium (fig. 80, _18_, _19_), and remain lying\r\nbetween it and the superficial stratum (tunica elastico-muscularis).\r\nThen they become rounded and gradually develop into cysts which grow\r\nlarger and are finally visible to the naked eye, being called oöcysts\r\n(figs. 80, _20_-_24_; 83). Their size at the beginning is about 5 µ,\r\nthe maximum that they attain is 60 µ, only exceptionally are they\r\nlarger.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83.--Section of the stomach of an _Anopheles_, with\r\ncysts (oöcysts) of the malignant tertian parasite. (After Grassi).]\r\n\r\nThe sporulation (figs. 80, _21_-_25_; 84), which now follows, begins\r\nwith repeated multiple fission of the nucleus. Long before the\r\ndefinitive number of nuclei, which varies with the individual, is\r\nattained the protoplasm, according to Grassi, begins to segment around\r\nthe individual large nuclei but without separating completely into cell\r\nareas. According to Schaudinn, however, there is a condensation of the\r\noutstanding protoplasmic strands. It is certain that the number of\r\nnuclei increases with simultaneous decrease in size. They soon appear\r\non the surface of the strands or sporoblasts, surround themselves\r\nwith some cytoplasm and then elongate (fig. 84). In this manner the\r\nsporozoites are formed and break away from the unused remains of the\r\ncytoplasmic strands of the sporoblasts (fig. 80, _26_). The number\r\nof the sporozoites in an oöcyst varies from several hundreds to ten\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84.--Four different sporulation stages of malarial\r\nparasites from _Anopheles maculipennis_, much magnified. _a_-_c_, of\r\nthe malignant tertian parasite; _a_, four to four and a half days after\r\nsucking; _b_ and _c_, five to six days after sucking; _d_, of the\r\ntertian parasite, eight days after sucking. (After Grassi.)]\r\n\r\n  The sporulation is influenced in its duration by the external\r\n  temperature (Grassi, Jansci, Schoo). In the tertian parasite it takes\r\n  place quickest at a temperature of 25° to 30° C. and takes eight to\r\n  nine days. A temperature a few degrees lower has a retarding effect\r\n  (eighteen to nineteen days at 18° to 20° C). A still lower one has a\r\n  restraining or even destructive effect. Temperatures over 35° C. also\r\n  exercise a harmful effect. The malignant tertian parasite seems to\r\n  need a somewhat higher temperature and the quartan parasite a lower\r\n  one.\r\n\r\nThe sporozoites of the various malarial parasites show no specific\r\ndifferences. They were stated by Schaudinn to occur in three forms,\r\nand these were described as indifferent (neuter), female and male.\r\nThere is, however, little or no evidence for this hypothetical\r\ndifferentiation. The last were said to perish prematurely, that is, in\r\nthe oöcyst. The others after the rupture of the oöcysts enter the body\r\ncavity of the Anophelines, whence they are carried along in the course\r\nof the blood. Finally they penetrate the salivary glands (fig. 80,\r\n_27_) probably by their own activity, break through their epithelia and\r\naccumulate in the salivary duct (fig. 80, _27_). At the next bite by\r\nthe mosquito they are transmitted to the blood-vessels of man.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPECIES OF MALARIAL PARASITES OF MAN.\r\n\r\n  In view of the differences in opinion regarding “species” and\r\n  “varieties,” the dispute whether the malarial parasites of man\r\n  represent one species with several varieties, or several species is\r\n  almost superfluous. If necessary two genera may be distinguished.\r\n\r\nThe parasites of the tertian and quartan fever are alike in that\r\ntheir gametocytes have a rounded shape (figs. 80, _12_, _13_), whilst\r\nthe corresponding stages of the pernicious or malignant tertian\r\nparasites are crescentic (figs. 81, 88). These differences are used\r\nby some writers as the distinguishing characteristic of two genera:\r\n_Plasmodium_, Marchiafava and Celli, 1885, for the first mentioned\r\nspecies; _Laverania_, Grassi and Feletti, 1889, for the pernicious or\r\nmalignant tertian parasite. Whether there is a genuine quotidian fever\r\nand accordingly a special quotidian parasite is still disputed.\r\n\r\n  These parasites are treated in practical detail in Stephens and\r\n  Christophers’ “Practical Study of Malaria,” 3rd edition, 1908.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Plasmodium vivax*, Grassi and Feletti, 1890.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Hæmamœba vivax_, Grassi and Feletti, 1890; _Plasmodium\r\n  malariæ_ var. _tertianæ_, Celli and Sanfelice, 1891; _Hæmamœba\r\n  laverani_ var. _tertiana_, Labbé, 1894; *Hæmosporidium tertianum*,\r\n  Lewkowitz, 1897; _Plasmodium malariæ tertianum_, Labbé, 1899:\r\n  _Hæmamœba malariæ_ var. _magna_, Laveran, 1900, p.p.; _Hæmamœba\r\n  malariæ_ var. _tertianæ_, Laveran, 1901.\r\n\r\nThis species, _P. vivax_,[201] is the causal agent of the simple or\r\nspring tertian fever and is, therefore, named directly the tertian or\r\nbenign tertian parasite (figs. 80, _3_-_8_; 85). During the afebrile\r\nperiod in the patient, the young trophozoites or amœbulæ appear on or\r\nin the red blood corpuscles as pale bodies of 1·5 µ to 2 µ diameter\r\nwhich at first show only slow amœboid movements. Their nucleus is\r\ndifficult to recognize in the early stage. Soon the food vacuole is\r\nformed and this grows concomitantly with the trophozoite and the\r\nparasite has a ring-like appearance. Afterwards the vacuole diminishes,\r\nand at this period the first brownish melanin granule appears. From\r\nthis time the activity and number of the pigment granules increase\r\nwith continuous growth. When the parasite has grown to about one-third\r\nthe diameter of the erythrocyte the latter shows characteristic red\r\nSchüffner’s dots or “fine stippling,” after staining with Romanowsky’s\r\nsolution. Later, after about twenty-four hours, the blood corpuscles\r\nbegin to grow pale, then to increase in size, and after thirty-six\r\nhours, that is, about twelve hours before the next attack of fever,\r\nschizogony of the parasite is initiated by the division of the nucleus.\r\nThe parasite at this time occupies half to two-thirds of the enlarged\r\nblood corpuscle. The daughter nuclei continue dividing until sixteen,\r\nand occasionally twenty-four, daughter nuclei are produced. The pigment\r\nwhich, up till now lies nearer the periphery, moves to the middle,\r\nwhile the nuclei lie nearer the surface.\r\n\r\n[201] See Schaudinn, F. (1902), _Arb. a. d. kaiserl. Gesundheits._,\r\nxix, pp. 169–250, 3 plates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85.--Development of the tertian parasite in the red\r\nblood corpuscles of man; on the right a “Polymitus.” (After Mannaberg.)\r\nSee also fig. 80, _3_--_7_.]\r\n\r\nAround each nucleus a portion of cytoplasm collects and thus young\r\nmerozoites are produced. These separate from each other and from the\r\nlittle residual masses[202] which contain the melanin and pass from\r\nthe blood corpuscles, which now can hardly be recognized, to the blood\r\nplasma, where they soon attack new erythrocytes.\r\n\r\n[202] The pigment masses (melanin or hæmozoin) are taken up by the\r\nleucocytes, particularly the mononuclear ones, and are carried\r\nespecially to the spleen, and also to the liver and the bone-marrow.\r\nFrom this circumstance arises the well-known pigmentation of the spleen\r\nin persons who have suffered from malaria.\r\n\r\nThe migration of the merozoites initiates a new attack of fever and two\r\ngroups of tertian parasites in the blood, differing in development by\r\nabout twenty-four hours, are the conditions for febris tertiana duplex.\r\n\r\nAfter a lengthy duration of fever the gametocytes (figs. 80, _9_--_12_)\r\nappear. They are uninucleate. The microgametocytes are about the size\r\nof fully developed schizonts, the macrogametocytes are somewhat larger.\r\nTheir further development takes place in Anophelines.\r\n\r\nThe chief distinctive characteristics of the simple tertian parasite,\r\nas seen in infected blood, are:--(1) The infected red-cell is usually\r\nenlarged; (2) the presence of fine red granules known as Schüffner’s\r\ndots in the red blood corpuscles, after Romanowsky staining; (3)\r\nthe fragile appearance of the parasite compared with other species.\r\nLarge forms are pigmented, irregular and “flimsy-looking,” sometimes\r\nappearing to consist of separate parts. Irregularity of contour is\r\ncommon.\r\n\r\nAhmed Emin[203] (1914) has described a small variety of _P. vivax_.\r\n\r\n[203] _Bull. Soc. Path. Exot._, vii, p. 385.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Plasmodium malariæ*, Laveran.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Oscillaria malariæ_, Laveran, p.p., 1883; _Hæmamœba malariæ_,\r\n  Gr. et Fel., 1890; _Plasmodium malariæ_ var. _quartanæ_, Celli et\r\n  Sanfel., 1891; _Hæmamœba laverani_ var. _quartana_, Labbé, 1894;\r\n  _Hæmosporidium quartanæ_, Lewkowitz, 1897; _Plasmodium malariæ\r\n  quartanum_, Labbé, 1899; _Plasmodium golgii_, Sambon, 1902;\r\n  _Laverania malariæ_, Jancso, 1905 nec Grassi et Fel. 1890; _Hæmomœba\r\n  malariæ_ var. _quartanæ_; Lav., 1901.\r\n\r\n_Plasmodium malariæ_ is the parasite of quartan malaria (fig. 86). The\r\ntrophozoites of the quartan parasite differ from the corresponding\r\nstages of the tertian parasite in that their motility is less and\r\nsoon ceases. They differ also in their slower growth, by the early\r\ndisappearance of the food vacuole, by the more marked formation of\r\nthe dark brown pigment, and by the fact that the red blood corpuscles\r\nattacked are not altered either in colour or size.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86.--Development of the quartan parasite in the red\r\ncorpuscles of man--asexual stages. (After Manson.)]\r\n\r\nWhen the parasites have grown almost to the size of the erythrocytes\r\nschizogony occurs. The pigment granules arrange themselves in lines\r\nradiating towards the centre and the merozoites are also radially\r\ndisposed in groups of 6, 8, 10 or even 12, but are often arranged less\r\nregularly. The whole development, growth and schizogony, occupies\r\nseventy-two hours.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of quartana duplex or triplex is conditional on the\r\npresence in the blood of the patient of two or three groups of\r\n_Plasmodia_ differing in their development by twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThe chief distinctive characters of the quartan parasite are: (1)\r\nThe erythrocyte is unchanged in size; (2) the rings are compact and\r\nshow pigment early; in the larger forms the chromatin is dense and\r\nrelatively plentiful; (3) the pigment, which is relatively well-marked,\r\nmay be arranged at the periphery.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Laverania malariæ*, Grassi and Feletti, 1890 = *Plasmodium\r\nfalciparum*, Welch, 1897.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Plasmodium malariæ_ var. _quotidianæ_, Celli et Sanf., 1891;\r\n  _Hæmamœba malariæ præcox_, Gr. et Fel., 1892 (nec _H. præcox_,\r\n  Gr. et Fel., 1890); _Hæmamœba laverani_, Labbé, 1894; _Hæmatozoön\r\n  falciparum_, Welch, 1897; _Hæmosporidium undecimanæ_ and _H.\r\n  sedecimanæ_ and _H. vigesimo-tertianæ_, Lewkowitz, 1897; _Hæmamœba\r\n  malariæ parva_, Lav., 1900; _Plasmodium præcox_, Dofl., 1901;\r\n  _Plasmodium immaculatum_, Schaud., 1902; _Plasmodium falciparum_,\r\n  Blanch., 1905.\r\n\r\nThe names most commonly used for the parasite of malignant tertian\r\nmalaria are _Plasmodium falciparum_ and _Laverania malariæ_.\r\n\r\nThe summer and autumn fever (_febris æstivo-autumnalis_), also called\r\nmalignant tertian or sub-tertian, is caused by a malarial parasite\r\nwhich is distinguished by the small size of its schizont, while the\r\ngametocytes are crescentic (figs. 81, 88).\r\n\r\n  Most authors identify this kind of fever or the parasites which\r\n  cause it (_Laverania malariæ_) with the pernicious malaria of the\r\n  tropics. Ziemann, however, repeatedly has drawn attention to certain\r\n  small but definite differences between the usual malignant tertian\r\n  or pernicious parasites which occur in the tropics and the tropical\r\n  parasites of some malarial districts, particularly of West Africa,\r\n  and insists that at least two varieties or sub-species occur. Other\r\n  investigators distinguish from this or these forms a quotidian\r\n  parasite. On the other hand, the assertion is made that there are no\r\n  specific differences, but that the malignant or pernicious tertian\r\n  parasite which normally needs forty-eight hours for its development\r\n  in the blood of man, can also develop in twenty-four hours. The\r\n  establishment of the duration of the development is a matter of\r\n  especial difficulty, because the stages of schizogony are far less\r\n  numerous in the peripheral blood than in that of the internal\r\n  organs. It is also stated that the tropical parasite very seldom\r\n  forms crescentic but rather rounded gametocytes. According to such\r\n  an observation the organism would belong to _Plasmodium_ and not to\r\n  _Laverania_. The question whether the tropical fevers are caused by\r\n  two different parasites does not seem to be definitely settled.\r\n\r\nThe young trophozoite of the malignant, pernicious tertian, or\r\nsub-tertian parasite (fig. 87) are but slightly active and are very\r\nsmall, even after the formation of the comparatively large food\r\nvacuole, which makes the body appear annular (“signet ring” stage).\r\nOften two and even more parasites are found in one blood corpuscle.\r\n\r\nFully grown they only attain two-thirds or less of the diameter of\r\nthe erythrocytes, which display an inclination to shrink and then\r\nappear darker than the normal (brass-coloured). In the early stage\r\ndots or stippling--sometimes called Maurer’s dots--appear on the blood\r\ncorpuscles as in those attacked by the ordinary tertian parasite\r\n(_Plasmodium vivax_), but the Maurer’s dots are relatively coarse and\r\nfew, and are not easily stained. These dots were first described by\r\nStephens and Christophers in 1900, and subsequently by Maurer in 1902.\r\n\r\nAbout thirty hours after the entrance into the blood corpuscles, the\r\nparasites are rarely found in the peripheral blood, but they are\r\npresent in the internal organs, and especially in the spleen. The\r\nschizogony, which now begins in the internal organs, proceeds on the\r\nsame lines as that of the quartan parasite, that is, usually with the\r\nmerozoites radially arranged around a central agglomeration of dark\r\nbrown pigment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 87.--The pernicious malignant or sub-tertian\r\nparasite in the red corpuscles of man, asexual stages. (After Manson.)]\r\n\r\nThe number of merozoites formed is quoted differently, _e.g._, 8 to\r\n24, on an average 12 to 16. However, according to the recent cultural\r\nresearches of J. G. and D. Thomson[204] (1913) the number of merozoites\r\nof _P. falciparum_ is 32. D. Thomson, from examination of spleen smears\r\nat autopsy, also concludes that the number of merozoites may reach 32.\r\nDuring their formation the blood corpuscle which is attacked gets paler\r\nand disintegrates.\r\n\r\n[204] _Proc. Roy. Soc._, B, lxxxvii, p. 77.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88.--The crescents of the malignant tertian\r\nparasite. (After Mannaberg.) See also fig. 81.]\r\n\r\nThe gametocytes which finally appear are attenuated, curved bodies,\r\nrounded at each end and known as crescents (figs. 81, 88), and are\r\nprovided with a nucleus and with coarse pigment masses. In the males\r\nthe pigment is more scattered than in the females, where it is around\r\nthe nucleus. Their length is 9 µ to 14 µ, and their breadth is 2 µ to\r\n3 µ. At first they are still in the pale blood corpuscles, later they\r\nfree themselves and are found in numbers in the peripheral blood in\r\ncases of pernicious malaria of Southern Europe and the tropics, while,\r\non the other hand, they occur much more rarely in the peripheral blood\r\nin West African malignant tertian. Their further development takes\r\nplace under the same conditions as in the other malarial parasites.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89.--Section through a tubule of the salivary gland\r\nof an _Anopheles_ with sporozoites of the malignant tertian parasites;\r\non the left at the top a single sporozoite greatly magnified. (After\r\nGrassi).]\r\n\r\nD. Thomson (1914),[205] from studies of autopsy smears, has shown that\r\ncrescents develop chiefly in the bone-marrow and spleen, and take\r\nabout ten days to grow into the adult state in the internal organs.\r\nHe believes that crescents are produced from ordinary asexual spores.\r\nQuinine, he states, has no direct destructive action on crescents, but\r\nit destroys the asexual source of supply.\r\n\r\n[205] _Annals Trop. Med. and Parasitol._, viii, p. 85.\r\n\r\nThe sporozoites of _Laverania malariæ_ (_P. falciparum_) are\r\nrepresented in fig. 89.\r\n\r\nThe principal distinctive characters of the malignant tertian parasite\r\nare: (1) The ring forms are very small, occasionally bacilliform, and\r\nmay be marginal (“accolé” of Laveran); (2) the larger trophozoites\r\nare often ovoid, and about one-third or one-half of the erythrocyte\r\nin size; (3) the infected red cells sometimes show coarse stippling\r\n(Maurer’s dots); (4) the gametocytes, or sexual forms, are crescentic\r\nin shape.\r\n\r\nJ. W. W. Stephens (1914) has described a new malarial parasite of\r\nman; it is called _Plasmodium tenue_. It is very amœboid, with scanty\r\ncytoplasm and much chromatin, sometimes rod-like or irregular. The\r\nparasite was described from a blood-smear of an Indian child. The\r\ncreation of a new species for this parasite has been criticized by\r\nBalfour and Wenyon, and by Craig.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Plasmodium relictum*, Sergent, 1907.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Plasmodium præcox_, Grassi and Feletti, 1890; _Plasmodium\r\n  danilewskyi_, Gr. et Fel., 1890; _Hæmamœba relicta_, Gr. et Fel.,\r\n  1891; _Proteosoma grassii_, Labbé, 1894.\r\n\r\n  Hæmamœboid, pigment-producing, malarial parasites are often found in\r\n  birds. Like the human malarial parasites they have been variously\r\n  named. Labbé created the genus _Proteosoma_ for them, and this name\r\n  is still often used as a distinctive one unofficially. The correct\r\n  name is stated to be either _Plasmodium relictum_ or _P. præcox_,\r\n  or possibly even _P. danilewskyi_, assuming that there is only one\r\n  species. The nomenclature of the malarial parasites is most confused.\r\n  The avian malarial parasites are transmitted by Culicine mosquitoes.\r\n\r\n  The organism was discovered by Grassi in the blood of birds in Italy,\r\n  and causes a fatal disease in partridges in Hungary. Sparrows are\r\n  affected in India, and it was this Plasmodium in which Ross first\r\n  traced the development of a malarial parasite in a mosquito. The\r\n  parasite may be transmitted from bird to bird by blood-inoculation,\r\n  canaries being very susceptible.\r\n\r\n  The principal stages of the avian plasmodium closely resemble those\r\n  of the malarial parasites of man. In its earliest stage _P. relictum_\r\n  is unpigmented, but soon the trophozoite grows and becomes pigmented,\r\n  meanwhile displacing the nucleus of the avian red-blood corpuscle,\r\n  a characteristic feature, distinguishing it from _Halteridium_.\r\n  Schizonts are formed, each of which gives rise to about nine\r\n  merozoites in the circulating blood. Sexual forms or gametocytes also\r\n  occur in the blood. These develop in _Culex fatigans_, _C. pipiens_\r\n  and _C. nemorosus_. Oökinetes or vermicules are formed in twelve\r\n  to fifteen hours in the stomach of the mosquito, and in one to two\r\n  days well-developed round oöcysts may be seen. In three to four days\r\n  sporoblasts have formed within the oöcysts and young sporozoites\r\n  begin to develop. In nine to ten days the oöcysts are mature, being\r\n  filled with sporozoites. The oöcysts then burst and the sporozoites\r\n  travel through the thoracic muscles to the salivary glands of the\r\n  Culicine.\r\n\r\n  Neumann, experimenting with canaries, found that _Stegomyia fasciata_\r\n  could transmit the infection, but less efficiently than species of\r\n  _Culex_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CULTIVATION OF MALARIAL PARASITES.\r\n\r\nThe successful cultivation of malarial parasites _in vitro_ was first\r\nrecorded by C. C. Bass and by Bass and Johns (1912).[206] Since then,\r\nJ. G. and D. Thomson,[207] and McLellan (1912–13), Ziemann[208] and\r\nothers have repeated the experiments.\r\n\r\n[206] _Journ. Exptl.

One-tenth of a cubic centimetre of a 50 per\r\ncent. aqueous solution of glucose or dextrose is placed in the test\r\ntube, preferably before adding the blood. The blood is defibrinated\r\nby stirring gently with the wire. When defibrination is complete the\r\nwire and the clot are removed, and the glucose-blood is transferred,\r\nin portions, to several smaller sterile tubes, each containing a\r\ncolumn of blood about one inch in height. The tubes are plugged and\r\ncapped and then transferred, standing upright, to an incubator\r\nkept at a temperature of 37° C. to 41° C. The blood corpuscles soon\r\nsettle, leaving a column of serum at the top, to the extent of about\r\nhalf an inch in each tube. The leucocytes need not be removed by\r\ncentrifugalization. J. G. Thomson (1913) and his collaborators did not\r\nfind it necessary to destroy the complement in the serum, and they\r\nfound that the malarial parasites developed at all levels in the column\r\nof corpuscles, and not merely on the surface layer of the corpuscles as\r\nfirst stated by Bass and Johns.\r\n\r\nSo far only the asexual generation of the malarial parasites has been\r\ngrown _in vitro_. Thomson rarely observed hæmolysis in the cultures.\r\nClumping of the malignant tertian parasites occurred. In cultures of\r\nthe benign tertian parasite (_Plasmodium vivax_) clumping was not\r\nobserved. J. G. and D. Thomson consider that this difference as regards\r\nclumping explains why only young forms of malignant tertian are found\r\nin peripheral blood, as the clumping tendency of the larger forms\r\ncauses them to be arrested in the finer capillaries of the internal\r\norgans. It also explains the tendency to pernicious symptoms, such as\r\ncoma, in malignant tertian malaria. Further it was found from cultures\r\nthat _P. falciparum_ was capable of producing thirty-two spores\r\n(merozoites) in maximum segmentation, while _P. vivax_ produced sixteen\r\nspores (merozoites) as a rule, though the number might be greater than\r\nsixteen. (Quartan parasites produce eight spores or merozoites in\r\nschizogony.)\r\n\r\nIt may also be mentioned here that _Babesia_ (_Piroplasma_) _canis_ has\r\nbeen successfully cultivated _in vitro_ by Bass’s method. This has been\r\naccomplished by Thomson and Fantham,[209] Ziemann, and Toyoda in 1913.\r\nJ. G. Thomson and Fantham used the simplified Bass technique recorded\r\nabove, namely, infected blood and glucose, incubating at 37° C. In\r\none of the _B. canis_ cultures, starting with heart blood of a dog\r\ncontaining corpuscles infected with one, two, or, exceptionally, four\r\npiroplasmata, Thomson and Fantham succeeded in obtaining a maximum of\r\nthirty-two merozoites in a corpuscle. The cultures are infective to\r\ndogs and sub-cultures have been obtained.\r\n\r\n[209] _Annals Trop. Med. and Parasitol._, vii, p. 621.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Piroplasmidæ*, França.\r\n\r\nThe parasites included in this provisional family or group belong\r\nto the Hæmosporidia. They are minute organisms, sometimes amœboid,\r\nbut usually possessing a definite form. They are endoglobular, being\r\ncontained within mammalian red blood corpuscles, but they produce no\r\npigment. The true Piroplasmata, belonging to the genus _Babesia_,\r\ndestroy the host corpuscles, setting free the hæmoglobin, which is\r\nexcreted by the kidneys of the cow, sheep, horse, dog, etc., acting\r\nas host. The disease produced, variously called piroplasmosis or\r\nbabesiasis, is consequently characterized by a red coloration of the\r\nurine known as hæmoglobinuria, or popularly as “red-water.” One of the\r\nbest known piroplasms is _Piroplasma bigeminum_ or _Babesia bovis_\r\n(probably the latter name is correct), which is the causal agent of\r\n“Texas fever” or “red-water” in cattle and is spread by ticks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 90.--_Nuttallia equi_, life-cycle as seen in red\r\nblood corpuscles in stained preparations of peripheral blood. (After\r\nNuttall and Strickland.)]\r\n\r\nOf recent years, researches on the morphology of these blood parasites\r\nhas led to their separation into various genera and species. However,\r\nour knowledge is still very far from complete. The various genera\r\nrecognized by França[210] (1909), and placed in a provisional family,\r\nPiroplasmidæ, may be listed, though further research may lead to\r\nemendations:--\r\n\r\n[210] _Arch. Inst. Bact. Camara Pestana_, iii, p. 11.\r\n\r\n(1) _Babesia_ (Starcovici) or _Piroplasma_ (Patton). Pyriform\r\nparasites, dividing by a special form of budding or gemmation with\r\nchromatin forking, as well as by direct binary fission. Parasitic in\r\noxen, dogs, sheep, horses, etc.\r\n\r\n(2) _Theileria_ (Bettencourt, França and Borges). Rod-shaped and oval\r\nparasites occurring in cattle and deer. _T. parva_ is the pathogenic\r\nagent of African East Coast fever in cattle.\r\n\r\n(3) _Nuttallia_ (França). Oval or pear-shaped parasites, with\r\nmultiplication in the form of a cross. _N. equi_[211] (fig. 90) of\r\nequine “piroplasmosis” (nuttalliosis). _N. herpestidis_ in a mongoose.\r\n\r\n[211] _Parasitology_, v (1912), p. 65.\r\n\r\n(4) _Nicollia_ (Nuttall). Oval or pear-shaped parasites with\r\ncharacteristic nuclear dimorphism, and with quadruple division at first\r\nfan-like, then like a four-leaved clover. _N. quadrigemina_ from the\r\ngondi.\r\n\r\n(5) _Smithia_ (França). Pear-shaped, single forms stretching across the\r\nblood corpuscle. Multiplication into four in the form of a cross. _S.\r\nmicroti_ from _Microtus arvalis_, _S. talpæ_ from the mole.\r\n\r\n(6) _Rossiella_ (Nuttall). This belongs to the family Piroplasmidæ\r\nof França. It is intracorpuscular and non-pigment forming, occurring\r\nsingly, in pairs, or occasionally in fours. It is usually round and\r\nlarger than Babesia. The parasite multiplies by binary fission. _R.\r\nrossi_ in the jackal.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Babesia_ is the best known and most important, and will be\r\nconsidered next.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Babesia*, Starcovici, 1893.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Pyrosoma_, Smith and Kilborne, 1893; _Apiosoma_, Wandolleck,\r\n  1895; _Piroplasma_, W. H. Patton, 1895; _Amœbosporidium_, Bonome,\r\n  1895.\r\n\r\nThe organisms belonging to this genus are pyriform, round or amœboid.\r\nThe characteristic mode of division is as follows: Just before division\r\nthe parasite becomes amœboid and irregular in shape, (fig. 91, _1–5_)\r\nwith a compact nucleus. The latter gives off a nuclear bud. This\r\nnuclear bud divides into two by forking (fig. 91, _6_, _7_). The\r\nchromatin forks grow towards the surface of the body of the rounded\r\nparasite, and then two cytoplasmic buds grow out. The forking nuclear\r\nbuds, which are *Y*-shaped, pass into the cytoplasmic outgrowths[212]\r\n(fig. 91, _8_, _9_). The buds gradually increase in size at the\r\nexpense of the parent form until they become two pear-shaped parasites\r\njoined at their pointed ends. The connecting strand shrinks and the\r\ntwo daughter forms separate (fig. 91, _10–14_). The pyriform parasites\r\nafter having exhausted the blood corpuscle escape from it (fig. 91,\r\n_15_), and seek out fresh host corpuscles, entering by the rounded,\r\nblunt end (fig. 91, _1_). It is the pyriform phase of the parasite\r\nwhich penetrates red blood corpuscles, not rounded forms, which\r\ndie if set free. The pyriform parasite, however, becomes rounded\r\n(fig. 91, _2_, _3_), soon after its entry into a fresh host cell. This\r\ninteresting mode of division by gemmation and chromatin forking has\r\nbeen made diagnostic of the genus _Babesia_ by Nuttall.[213] Rounded\r\nforms of _Babesia_ divide by binary fission, and this direct method can\r\nalso be adopted by the other forms of Babesia.\r\n\r\n[212] Nuttall and Graham-Smith, _Journ. Hyg._, vii, p. 232.\r\n\r\n[213] “Piroplasmosis,” Herter Lectures, _Parasitology_, vi, p. 302.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 91.--_Babesia_ (_Piroplasma_) _canis_, life-cycle\r\nin stained preparations of infected blood of dog. (After Nuttall and\r\nGraham-Smith.)]\r\n\r\n  The distribution of the chromatin in the pear-shaped _Babesia_,\r\n  as seen in _B. canis_ and _B. bovis_, is interesting. The main\r\n  nuclear body consists of a karyosome surrounded by a clear area.\r\n  There is also a loose (chromidial) mass of chromatin representing\r\n  the remains of the chromatin forks seen during the formation of the\r\n  parasite as a daughter form by gemmation. Occasionally there is\r\n  a small dot or point, the so-called “blepharoplast” of Schaudinn\r\n  and Lühe. This minute dot is not a flagellate blepharoplast, for\r\n  there is no flagellate stage in the life-history of Babesia. These\r\n  nuclear phenomena have been described by Nuttall and Graham-Smith\r\n  and Christophers (1907)[214] for _B. canis_, by Fantham (1907)[215]\r\n  for _B. bovis_, and by Thomson and Fantham (1913) from glucose-blood\r\n  cultures of _B. canis_.\r\n\r\n[214] _Sci. Mems. Govt. India_, No. 29.\r\n\r\n[215] _Quart. Journ. Microsc. Sci._, li, p. 297.\r\n\r\nBabesia are tick borne, as was first shown by Smith and Kilborne\r\n(1893). The developmental cycle in the tick is incompletely known. The\r\nbest accounts are those of Christophers (1907)[216] for _B. canis_ and\r\nKoch (1906) for _B. bovis_, and these accounts are supplementary. The\r\nprincipal stages, so far as known, may be summarized thus:--\r\n\r\n[216] _Sci. Mems. Govt. India_, No. 29.\r\n\r\n  (1) The piroplasms taken by the tick in feeding on blood pass into\r\n  the tick’s stomach. The pyriform parasites, which alone are capable\r\n  of further development, are set free from the blood corpuscles. In\r\n  about twelve to eighteen hours they become amœboid, sending out long,\r\n  stiff, slender, pointed pseudopodia. The nucleus of each parasite\r\n  divides unequally into two. Similar forms have been obtained in\r\n  cultures. These stellate forms may be gametes, and according to Koch\r\n  fuse in pairs.\r\n\r\n  (2) A spherical stage follows, possibly representing the zygote. This\r\n  grows, and a uninucleate globular mass results. This form is found in\r\n  large numbers on the third day, according to the observations of Koch.\r\n\r\n  (3) A club-shaped organism is next formed. This may represent an\r\n  oökinete stage. The club-shaped bodies are motile and gregarine-like,\r\n  and are about four times the size of the blood forms. These\r\n  club-shaped bodies and subsequent stages were described by\r\n  Christophers in the development of _B. canis_ in the dog-tick,\r\n  _Rhipicephalus sanguineus_.\r\n\r\n  (4) The club-shaped bodies pass from the gut of the tick into the\r\n  ovary, and so get into the ova. There they become globular, and later\r\n  are found in the cells of the developing tick-embryo. The parasites\r\n  are, then, transmitted hereditarily. Similar globular bodies are\r\n  found in the tissue cells of the body of tick nymphs which have\r\n  taken up piroplasms. The globular stage was called the “zygote” by\r\n  Christophers, but it may correspond to the oöcyst of Plasmodia.\r\n\r\n  (5) The globular body divides into a number of “sporoblasts,” which\r\n  become scattered through the tissues of the larval or nymphal tick,\r\n  as the case may be.\r\n\r\n  (6) The sporoblasts themselves divide into a large number of\r\n  sporozoites, which are small uninucleate bodies, somewhat resembling\r\n  blood piroplasms. The sporozoites collect in the salivary glands of\r\n  the tick. They are inoculated into the vertebrate when the tick next\r\n  feeds.\r\n\r\nThe chief species of _Babesia_ and their pathogenic importance may be\r\nlisted thus:--\r\n\r\n(1) _Babesia bovis_ (Babes) produces infectious hæmoglobinuria of\r\ncattle in Europe and North Africa. It is transmitted by _Ixodes\r\nricinus_. A similar parasite also occurs in deer.\r\n\r\n(2) _Babesia bigemina_ (Smith and Kilborne) produces Texas fever,\r\ntristeza, or red-water in cattle in North and South America, South\r\nAfrica and Australia. It is transmitted by _Boöphilus annulatus_ in\r\nNorth America, by _B. australis_ in Australia, South America, and the\r\nPhilippines, and by _B. decoloratus_ in South Africa.\r\n\r\nThe parasite is from 2 µ to 4 µ long, and from 1·5 µ to 2 µ broad.\r\n\r\n_Babesia bigemina_ may be the same parasite as _B. bovis_.\r\n\r\n(3) _Babesia divergens_ (MacFadyean and Stockman) is a small parasite.\r\nIt is found in cattle suffering from red-water in Norway, Germany,\r\nRussia, Hungary, Ireland, Finland, and France, and is transmitted by\r\n_Ixodes ricinus_.\r\n\r\n(4) _Babesia canis_ (Piana and Galli-Valerio) gives rise to malignant\r\njaundice or infectious icterus in dogs in Southern Europe, India,\r\nand other parts of Asia and North Africa, where it is transmitted by\r\n_Rhipicephalus sanguineus_. In Africa generally, especially South\r\nAfrica, the disease is transmitted by _Hæmaphysalis leachi_. _Babesia\r\ncanis_ varies from 0·7 µ to 5 µ, the size depending partly on the\r\nnumber of parasites within the corpuscle. It averages about 3 µ. It\r\nhas been cultivated in Bass’ medium (glucose and infected blood), see\r\np. 172.\r\n\r\nIn India _Piroplasma gibsoni_ (Patton) infects hunt dogs and jackals.\r\nIt is annular or oval in shape.\r\n\r\n(5) _Babesia ovis_ (Babes) produces “Carceag,” a disease of sheep in\r\nRoumania, the Balkan Peninsula, Italy, and Transcaucasia. It varies in\r\nsize from 1 µ to 3 µ. It is transmitted by _Rhipicephalus bursa_. The\r\nparasite has recently been recorded from Rhodesia.\r\n\r\n(6) _Babesia caballi_ (Nuttall and Strickland) causes “biliary\r\nfever” in equines. The parasite occurs in Russia, Roumania, and\r\nTranscaucasia. It varies in size from 1 µ to 2 µ. It is transmitted by\r\n_Dermacentor reticulatus_.\r\n\r\n  It should be mentioned that _Nuttallia equi_ also causes\r\n  “piroplasmosis” in equines, with symptoms of hæmoglobinuria and\r\n  jaundice in Italy, Sardinia, many parts of Africa, Transcaucasia,\r\n  India, and Brazil. In Africa it is transmitted by _Rhipicephalus\r\n  evertsi_. It has been shown experimentally that a horse recovered\r\n  from _Babesia caballi_ was susceptible to the inoculation of\r\n  _Nuttallia equi_ blood.\r\n\r\n(7) _Babesia pitheci_ (P. H. Ross) was found in a monkey,\r\n_Cercopithecus_ sp., in Uganda. The pear-shaped forms measure 1·5 µ by\r\n2·5 µ.\r\n\r\n(8) _Babesia muris_ (Fantham)[217] was found in white rats. The\r\npyriform parasites are 2 µ to 3 µ long and 1 µ to 1·5 µ broad; oval\r\nforms are 0·5 to 1·5 µ diameter.\r\n\r\n[217] _Quart. Journ. Microsc. Sci._, 1, p. 493.\r\n\r\nThe usual symptoms of babesiasis (piroplasmosis) are high fever, loss\r\nof appetite, hæmoglobinuria, icterus, anæmia, paralysis, and death in\r\nabout a week in acute cases. In chronic cases there is anæmia, and\r\nhæmoglobinuria is less marked. When animals recover, there are still\r\nsome piroplasms left in the blood. “Recovered” or “salted” animals\r\nare not susceptible to reinfection, but ticks feeding on them acquire\r\npiroplasms, and are a source of danger to freshly imported animals.\r\n\r\n  _Treatment._--Trypan-blue is the best drug, as shown by Nuttall\r\n  and Hadwen[218] (1909). It should be administered intravenously\r\n  in 1 to 1·5 per cent. aqueous solution. A dose of 5 to 10 c.c. is\r\n  curative for dogs, one of 100 to 150 c.c. for horses and cattle.\r\n  Unfortunately, the tissues are coloured blue by the drug. The\r\n  “salted” animals, after trypan-blue treatment, still harbour the\r\n  parasites in their blood for years.\r\n\r\n[218] _Parasitology_, ii, p. 156.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Theileria*, Bettencourt, França and Borges, 1907.\r\n\r\n  The organisms belonging to this genus are rod-like or bacilliform,\r\n  and coccoid or round.\r\n\r\n  The best known of the species of Theileria is _T. parva_, the\r\n  pathogenic agent of East Coast fever or Rhodesian fever in cattle in\r\n  Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Theileria parva*, Theiler, 1903.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Piroplasma parvum_.\r\n\r\nIn the blood corpuscles of infected cattle minute rod-like and oval\r\nparasites are seen. Some are comma shaped and others are clubbed\r\n(fig. 92, _1–12_). The rod-like forms measure 1 µ to 3 µ in length\r\nby 0·5 µ in breadth; the oval forms are 0·7 µ to 1·5 µ in diameter.\r\nThe intracorpuscular parasites are said by R. Gonder (1910) to be\r\ngametocytes, the rod-like forms being thought to be males, the oval\r\nforms to be females. Free parasites are practically never seen in the\r\nblood. It is known that it is impossible to produce the disease in\r\na healthy animal by blood inoculation, but only by intraperitoneal\r\ntransplantation of large pieces of infected spleen (Meyer). There may\r\nbe as many as eight parasites in a corpuscle. The chromatin is usually\r\nat one end of the organism. In some parasites the appearance of the\r\nchromatin suggests division, but such division, if it takes place, must\r\nbe very slow, as it has not been actually seen in progress. The red\r\nblood corpuscles appear merely to act as vehicles for the parasites\r\n(Nuttall, Fantham, and Porter).[219]\r\n\r\n[219] _Parasitology_, ii, p. 325; iii, p. 117.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 92.--_Theileria parva._ 1–12, intracorpuscular\r\nparasites, stained. (After Nuttall and Fantham); 13–18, Koch’s blue\r\nbodies, from stained spleen smear; 17–18, breaking up of Koch’s body.\r\n(After Nuttall.)]\r\n\r\n  In the internal organs, especially the lymphatic glands, spleen\r\n  and bone-marrow, are found multinucleate bodies known as Koch’s\r\n  blue bodies (fig. 92, _13–18_). These are schizonts, according\r\n  to Gonder.[220] The actual Koch’s blue bodies are said to be\r\n  extracellular, but similar multinucleate bodies, schizonts, occur\r\n  in lymphocytes. The schizonts divide and the merozoites resulting\r\n  probably invade the red blood corpuscles in the internal organs.\r\n  Gonder considers that the sporozoites injected by the tick collect in\r\n  the spleen and lymphatic glands, penetrate the lymphocytes and give\r\n  rise to the schizonts.\r\n\r\n[220] _Zeitschr. f. Infekt. paras. Krankh. u. Hyg. d. Haustiere_, viii,\r\np. 406.\r\n\r\n  Gonder has studied the cycle of _T. parva_ in the tick. He states\r\n  that the gametocytes leave the host corpuscles and give rise to\r\n  gametes, then conjugation occurs producing zygotes. The zygotes\r\n  are then said to become active to form ookinetes, and to enter the\r\n  salivary glands of the tick. Multiplication is said to occur therein,\r\n  producing a swarm of sporozoites. This work needs confirmation.\r\n\r\n  _T. parva_ is transmitted by _Rhipicephalus appendiculatus_, _R.\r\n  simus_, _R. evertsi_, _R. nitens_, and _R. capensis_. The parasites\r\n  are not hereditarily transmitted in _Rhipicephalus_, but when taken\r\n  by the transmitter at one stage of its development the tick is\r\n  infective in its next stage (_e.g._, if the larva becomes infected,\r\n  then the nymph is infective; if the nymph becomes infected, then the\r\n  adult is infective).\r\n\r\n  An animal recovered from _Theileria parva_ is incapable of infecting\r\n  ticks, but few animals recover from East Coast fever. Animals\r\n  suffering therefrom do not show hæmoglobinuria.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Theileria mutans*, Theiler, 1907·\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Piroplasma mutans_.\r\n\r\n  This is transmissible experimentally by blood inoculation. It\r\n  occurs in cattle in South Africa and Madagascar and is apparently\r\n  non-pathogenic. No Koch’s blue bodies are formed. It is transmitted\r\n  by ticks.\r\n\r\n  _Theileria annulata_ (Dschunkowsky and Luhs) occurs in cattle in\r\n  Transcaucasia.\r\n\r\n  A Theileria (_T. stordii_) has been found in a gazelle (França, 1912).\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Anaplasma*, Theiler, 1910.\r\n\r\n  This genus[221] may be mentioned here. The organisms included therein\r\n  are, according to Theiler, coccus-like, consisting of chromatin,\r\n  and are devoid of cytoplasm. They occur in the red blood corpuscles\r\n  of cattle, causing a disease characterized by destruction of red\r\n  cells, fever and anæmia, but with yellow urine. The disease is\r\n  tick transmitted. The bodies now called _Anaplasma marginale_ were\r\n  formerly described as marginal points. They multiply by simple\r\n  fission. They are said by Theiler to cause gall-sickness in cattle in\r\n  South Africa. Some authors doubt whether these bodies are organismal.\r\n\r\n[221] _Bull. Soc. Path. Exot._, iii, p. 135.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Paraplasma*, Seidelin, 1911.\r\n\r\nUnder this generic name Seidelin described certain bodies found\r\nby him in cases of yellow fever in 1909. The type species is _P.\r\nflavigenum_,[222] and is claimed by Seidelin to be the causal agent of\r\nyellow fever.\r\n\r\n[222] _Yellow Fever Bulletin_, i, p. 251.\r\n\r\n_Paraplasma flavigenum_ occurs in the early days of the disease as\r\nsmall chromatin granules with or without a faint trace of cytoplasm.\r\nThe bodies are usually intracorpuscular. Also, somewhat larger forms,\r\nwith distinct cytoplasm, are seen in small numbers. During the later\r\ndays of the disease still larger forms are found, and these occur\r\nalso in sections of organs (_e.g._, kidney) made post-mortem. Some of\r\nthese larger forms are perhaps schizonts. In the second period of the\r\ndisease possible micro- and macro-gametes may be found, some of which\r\nare extracorpuscular. Some small free bodies have been seen. Recently\r\nschizogony has been stated to occur in the lungs, and it is said that\r\nguinea-pigs can be inoculated with _Paraplasma flavigenum_, and show\r\nyellow pigment in the spleen.\r\n\r\nSeidelin places _Paraplasma_ in the _Babesiidæ_, with resemblances\r\nmore particularly to _Theileria_.

(After\r\nBütschli.)]\r\n\r\n  These parasites, which were discovered by Johannes Müller (1841),\r\n  live principally in fishes, and occasionally cause destructive\r\n  epizoötics amongst their hosts. Müller first observed them in\r\n  the form of whitish-yellow pustules on the skin or on the gills\r\n  of various fishes. These pustules contained masses of small\r\n  shell-covered bodies with or without tails (“psorosperms,” see\r\n  fig. 93). Similar bodies were also found in the air bladders of\r\n  certain fish. Creplin (1842) demonstrated the resemblance of the\r\n  cysts (“psorosperm tubes”) harbouring the psorosperms to the\r\n  “pseudonavicella-cysts” of a gregarine, as described by v. Siebold.\r\n  Dujardin (1845) considered that there was possibly some connection\r\n  between the protoplasmic “psorosperm tubes” and the spores they\r\n  contained, and the developmental stages of monocystid gregarines\r\n  from the vesiculæ seminales of earth-worms. The relationship of the\r\n  “fish psorosperms” was placed on a firmer basis by Leydig (1851)\r\n  and Lieberkühn. The former found numerous forms in marine fish, and\r\n  he discovered in species which live free in the gall bladder of\r\n  cartilaginous fishes that the psorosperms originated in a manner\r\n  similar to the gregarines. Lieberkühn (1854) studied the Myxosporidia\r\n  in the bladder of the pike (fig. 93, _a_, _b_, _d_), and observed\r\n  their amœboid movements, as well as the formation of the spores,\r\n  from each of which a small amœboid body escaped, a discovery that\r\n  was confirmed by Balbiani. The same author also found that spiral\r\n  filaments were enclosed in the so-called polar body, _i.e._, the\r\n  polar capsule of the psorosperm spores, and that these could be\r\n  protruded (fig. 93, _d_, and fig. 95).\r\n\r\n  The term Myxosporidia, which at the present day is universally\r\n  applied to the “psorosperm tubes,” was introduced by Bütschli\r\n  in 1881, who studied not only the structure and development of\r\n  the spores, but also the protoplasmic body of the parasites\r\n  (fig. 96), and confirmed the occurrence of numerous nuclei. Many\r\n  authors have made important additions to our knowledge of the\r\n  Myxosporidia: Perugia, Thélohan, Mingazzini, L. Pfeiffer, L. Cohn,\r\n  Doflein, Mercier, Schröder and Auerbach; while the presence of this\r\n  parasite outside the class of fishes has become known through Lutz,\r\n  Laveran, and others. The species causing disease in fishes have been\r\n  described by Ludwig, Railliet, Weltner, L. Pfeiffer, Zschokke, Hofer,\r\n  Doflein, Gurley, Plehn, Schuberg, Fantham and Porter. With regard to\r\n  classification the works of Thélohan (1895) and Gurley (1894) may be\r\n  mentioned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 95.--Schematic representation of a spore of\r\n_Myxobolus_.

(After\r\nThélohan.)]\r\n\r\n  The Myxosporidia live either free on the epithelial surface of hollow\r\n  organs (gall or urinary bladder, renal tubules, but never in the\r\n  intestine), or are enclosed in the tissues of their host. The gills\r\n  and muscular system are their favourite habitat, but other tissues or\r\n  organs may be attacked. Species of Myxosporidia are also known from\r\n  Amphibia, Reptilia, and a few invertebrates.\r\n\r\n  The free forms, which are often amœboid (fig. 96), move by the\r\n  aid of variously shaped pseudopodia, have a constant form, or may\r\n  exhibit contractions of the body. The tissue parasites often reach\r\n  a considerable size, so that the integument of the host forms\r\n  protuberances over them. They are of a roundish or irregular shape.\r\n  Frequently they are enveloped in a connective tissue covering formed\r\n  by the host.\r\n\r\n  The protoplasmic body in the trophic phase (fig. 96) shows a distinct\r\n  ectoplasm which is finely granular or sometimes striated, and an\r\n  endoplasm which is coarsely granular and contains many nuclei as\r\n  well as cell inclusions, such as crystals, pigment grains and fat\r\n  globules. The nuclei originate by division from the primitive nucleus\r\n  of the amœboid germ that issues from the spore. This amœbula may\r\n  or may not live intra-cellularly during the early stages of its\r\n  existence.\r\n\r\n  The multinucleate trophozoite of a Myxosporidian forms spores in\r\n  its endoplasm practically throughout its whole period of growth\r\n  (fig. 96). Vegetative reproduction by a process of external budding\r\n  or plasmotomy may also occur, as in _Myxidium lieberkühni_ from the\r\n  urinary bladder of the pike.\r\n\r\n  The myxosporidian trophozoite may produce two spores within\r\n  itself, when it is placed in the sub-order _Disporea_, or it may\r\n  produce numerous spores, which is characteristic of the sub-order,\r\n  _Polysporea_. The phenomenon of spore formation is not simple\r\n  (fig. 97), and the spore itself is surrounded by a bivalved shell or\r\n  sporocyst and contains polar capsules in addition to the amœboid germ\r\n  (fig. 97, G, H). The valves of the sporocyst and the polar capsules\r\n  are really differentiated nucleate cells, so that each spore is an\r\n  aggregate of cells rather than one cell, though only a single amœbula\r\n  issues from a spore. The accounts of spore formation vary somewhat\r\n  according to the different workers.\r\n\r\n  Spore formation is usually very complicated and there are differences\r\n  of opinion as to the interpretation of various stages, particularly\r\n  as to whether conjugation occurs therein. The process is initiated\r\n  by the concentration of cytoplasm around one of the nuclei of the\r\n  endoplasm, so that a small spherical mass or initial corpuscle is\r\n  produced, the pansporoblast (Gurley) or primitive sphere (Thélohan).\r\n  Some authors state that a pansporoblast really results from a\r\n  conjugation of two initial corpuscles (fig. 97, A-D). Nuclear\r\n  multiplication occurs within the pansporoblast (fig. 97, E), and\r\n  sooner or later two multinucleate sporoblasts are formed within it\r\n  (fig. 97, F). Each sporoblast gives rise to a single spore, which\r\n  consists of a sporocyst or envelope composed of two valves each\r\n  secreted by a cell, two polar capsules each secreted by a cell, and\r\n  the sporoplasm or amœbula which becomes binucleate (fig. 97, G).\r\n  During the process of spore formation (fig. 97) various vegetative\r\n  and reduction nuclei may be produced, in addition to those which are\r\n  essentially involved in spore formation, and the sporocyst cells may\r\n  be developed early.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 97.--_Myxobolus pfeifferi._ Spore formation.\r\nA, reproductive cell from plasmodial trophozoite; B, cell divided\r\nunequally into two; C, smaller cell forming envelope to larger one; D,\r\npansporoblast formed by union of two forms like C; E, multinucleate\r\npansporoblast, two of the nuclei being those of the envelope; F,\r\npansporoblast divided into two multinucleate sporoblasts; G, spore\r\ndifferentiation; _p_, two parietal cells forming sporocyst; _bc_, polar\r\ncapsules; _am_, binucleate amœbula; H, ripe spore in which the two\r\nnuclei of the amœbula have fused. (After Keysselitz.)]\r\n\r\n  Each spore contains two (figs. 94, 95) or more polar capsules which\r\n  are clearly visible in the fresh condition. Each polar capsule is\r\n  a hollow, more or less pear-shaped body, secreted by a cell and\r\n  having a well defined contour. Within it, a long, delicate, elastic\r\n  filament, the polar filament, is formed, and lies spirally coiled\r\n  in the polar capsule until just before the emergence of the amœbula\r\n  from the spore (fig. 95). The polar filament is ejected, probably\r\n  under the influence of the digestive juice, when the spore reaches\r\n  a new host, and serves to anchor the spore to the tissue with which\r\n  it is in contact, and thus allow of the emergence of the amœbula in\r\n  a situation suitable for its development. The polar capsule with its\r\n  contained polar filament has been compared with the stinging cells or\r\n  nematocysts of the Cœlentera, but it has a totally different function.\r\n\r\n  The spores fulfil the purpose of effecting transmission to other\r\n  hosts. Infection occurs by the ingestion of the parasites per os\r\n  after their escape by some means from their host. Thélohan and\r\n  others have demonstrated that the valves of the spores soon open\r\n  under the influence of the digestive juices, thus allowing the young\r\n  myxosporidia to escape. Their further history is unknown; but it may\r\n  be surmised that they either travel direct to the organs usually\r\n  affected (gall bladder, urinary bladder), or are distributed in the\r\n  body by means of the circulatory or lymphatic systems.\r\n\r\n  The Myxosporidia that invade tissues are often deadly to their\r\n  hosts. They may be present in a state of “diffuse infiltration”\r\n  when practically every organ of the body may be infected, as in\r\n  barbel disease (due to _Myxobolus pfeifferi_). On the other hand,\r\n  the parasites may be concentrated at one spot, when cysts, either\r\n  large or small, are produced. Such cysts occur on the gills of many\r\n  fishes. A few additional important pathogenic forms are _Myxobolus\r\n  cyprini_, the excitant of “pockenkrankheit” of carp, and _Lentospora\r\n  cerebralis_, parasitic in the skeleton of Salmonidæ and Gadidæ.\r\n  The skeletons of the tail, fins and skull particularly are seats\r\n  of infection, and from the skull the Lentospora can spread to the\r\n  semicircular canals, resulting in loss of power to maintain its\r\n  balance on the part of the fish. On this account the malady is\r\n  termed “drehkrankheit.” Young fish are more particularly infected.\r\n  _Myxobolus neurobius_ infects the spinal cord and nerves of trout.\r\n\r\n  Myxosporidia are divided into two sub-orders--_Disporea_ and\r\n  _Polysporea_--according to whether they form only two or several\r\n  spores during their growth. The former include two genera limited to\r\n  fishes, which are easily distinguishable by the shape of the spores:\r\n  _Leptotheca_, Thél., with a rounded spore, and _Ceratomyxa_, Thél.,\r\n  with a very elongate spore. The larger number of genera belong to the\r\n  _Polysporea_, which are divided into three families:\r\n\r\n    (1) Amœboid germ with a vacuole  {(a) With two polar capsules.--\r\n          the contents of which do   {        _Myxidiidæ._\r\n          not stain with iodine.     {(b) With four polar capsules.--\r\n                                              _Chloromyxidæ._\r\n\r\n    (2) Amœboid germ with a vacuole stainable with iodine. Spores with\r\n          two polar capsules.--_Myxobolidæ._\r\n\r\n  For further subdivisions the differences in the spores are\r\n  principally utilized.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder. *Microsporidia*, Balbiani.\r\n\r\n  These are the organisms discovered in the stickleback by Gluge in\r\n  1834, and in _Coccus hesperidum_ by Leydig in 1853. They have since\r\n  been found in numerous other arthropods, especially insects. They\r\n  acquired particular importance when it was discovered that they\r\n  were the cause of the “pébrine” disease (“gattina” of the Italians)\r\n  which caused so much destruction amongst silkworms (_Bombyx mori_).\r\n  Pasteur (1867–70) and especially Balbiani (1866) participated in the\r\n  researches on _Nosema bombycis_, and it was the latter who classed\r\n  the “pébrine bodies” or “psorospermia of the arthropoda” amongst the\r\n  Sporozoa as Microsporidia (1882).[223] The complete life cycle of\r\n  _N. bombycis_ was described in 1909 by Stempell. The Microsporidia\r\n  are not confined to insects and arachnoids, they are now known to\r\n  occur also in crustacea, worms, bryozoa, fishes, amphibians and\r\n  reptiles. Certain tumours in fishes, similar to those formed by many\r\n  Myxosporidia, are produced by Microsporidia. Fantham and Porter found\r\n  that _Nosema apis_ was pathogenic to bees and other insects, and\r\n  was the causal agent of the so-called “Isle of Wight” disease in\r\n  bees[224] in Great Britain.\r\n\r\n[223] _C. R. Acad. Sci._, Paris, xcv, p. 1168.\r\n\r\n[224] _Annals Trop. Med. and Parasitol._, vi, pp. 145–214, 3 pls.\r\n\r\n  The Microsporidia, as their name implies, form minute spores which\r\n  usually are oval or pear-shaped. Each spore contains a single polar\r\n  capsule which is not easily visible in the fresh state (fig. 98, _f_)\r\n  and a single amœboid germ issues from the spore (fig. 99, _b_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 98.--_Nosema apis._ Various stages in life-cycle.\r\n_a_, planonts or amœbulæ from chyle stomach of bee; _b_, amœboid\r\nplanont creeping over surface of gut epithelial cell; _c_, uninucleate\r\ntrophozoite within epithelial cell; _d_, meront with nucleus divided\r\ninto four, about to form four spores; _e_, epithelial cell crowded\r\nwith spores; _f_, young spore; _g_, spore showing five nuclei, polar\r\nfilament ejected, and amœbula, about to issue. × 1,500, _a-e_; × 2,150,\r\n_f-g_. (After Fantham and Porter.)]\r\n\r\n  The life cycle of _Nosema apis_, parasitic in bees, may be taken\r\n  as an example of that of a microsporidian. The infection of the\r\n  host is initiated by the ingestion of spores of _N. apis_ in food\r\n  or drink contaminated with the excrement of other infected bees.\r\n  Under the influence of the digestive juice of the bee the spore-coat\r\n  (sporocyst) softens, the polar filament is ejected and anchors the\r\n  spore to the gut epithelium, and the minute amœbula contained in the\r\n  spore emerges. The amœbula is capable of active amœboid movements\r\n  (fig. 98, _b_) and so is termed the planont or wandering form\r\n  (fig. 98, _a_). After a short time each planont penetrates between\r\n  or into the cells of the epithelium of the gut, a few only passing\r\n  through into the body cavity. Within the cells the amœbulæ become\r\n  more or less rounded, lose their power of movement, and after a\r\n  period of growth of the trophozoite (fig. 98, _c_) commence to divide\r\n  actively, these dividing forms being known as meronts (fig. 98,\r\n  _d_). Various forms of fission occur, and during this phase, termed\r\n  merogony, the numbers of the parasite within the host are greatly\r\n  increased, with concomitant destruction of the epithelium (fig. 98,\r\n  _e_). After a time sporogony commences. The full-grown meront becomes\r\n  successively the pansporoblast and sporoblast. Nuclear multiplication\r\n  and differentiation ensue and five nuclei are ultimately produced. At\r\n  the same time a sporocyst is secreted, and two vacuoles are produced\r\n  within. One is the polar capsule, and within it the polar filament\r\n  is differentiated; the other forms the posterior vacuole (fig. 98,\r\n  _g_). Between the two vacuoles the body cytoplasm or sporoplasm forms\r\n  a girdle-like mass. Of the nuclei, one regulates the polar capsule,\r\n  two control the secretion of the sporocyst, and two remain in the\r\n  sporoplasm. The polar capsule and polar filament are not usually\r\n  visible in the fresh condition, but can be demonstrated by the use\r\n  of various chemical reagents (fig. 100). The sporoplasm ultimately\r\n  becomes the amœbula (fig. 98, _g_) which issues from the spore after\r\n  the ejection of the polar filament.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 99.--_a_, section through the abdominal wall of\r\na silkworm, whose epithelial cells contain Microsporidia (_Nosema\r\nbombycis_); _b_, a spore, the contents of which are escaping. (After\r\nBalbiani.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 100.--_Nosema bombycis_, Naeg. Spores treated with\r\nnitric acid, thus rendering the polar capsule perceptible, and the\r\nfilament has protruded from one of the spores. (After Thélohan.)]\r\n\r\n  A trophozoite (meront) of _N. apis_ becomes a single pansporoblast\r\n  which gives rise to one sporoblast producing one spore, and this\r\n  procedure is characteristic of the genus _Nosema_. In other genera\r\n  the trophozoite may form more than one pansporoblast and each\r\n  pansporoblast may form a variable number of spores in different\r\n  cases. Various attempts at classification have been based on these\r\n  characteristics. It must suffice here to note that in the cases where\r\n  the trophozoite becomes one pansporoblast, the latter can produce\r\n  four spores in the genus _Gurleya_, eight spores in _Thélohania_ and\r\n  many spores in _Pleistophora_. In other cases, where the trophozoites\r\n  give rise to many pansporoblasts, each of the latter may form many\r\n  spores, as in the genus _Glugea_.\r\n\r\n  A few pathogenic microsporidian parasites other than _N. apis_ may\r\n  be mentioned. _N. bombycis_, causing pébrine in silkworms, may\r\n  infect any or all the tissues of the host (fig. 99). The larvæ of\r\n  the host, _i.e._, the “silkworms,” may become infected by eating\r\n  food contaminated with spore-containing excrement of already\r\n  infected silkworms. In cases of heavy infection the silkworm dies,\r\n  but should the infection be less intense the larva becomes a pupa\r\n  in which the parasite persists, so that the moth emerges from the\r\n  cocoon already infected. Not only is the moth parasitized itself,\r\n  but the Nosema reaches the generative organs of both sexes and\r\n  penetrates the ovaries of the female, with the result that the ova\r\n  are deposited infected. Such infected eggs are capable of developing,\r\n  so that infection may be transmitted hereditarily as well as by the\r\n  contaminative method. Infected eggs can be recognized by microscopic\r\n  examination, as Pasteur showed, and thus preventive measures may be\r\n  adopted.\r\n\r\n  A microsporidian parasite is known to occur on the roots of the\r\n  spinal and cranial nerves of _Lophius piscatorius_, the angler fish.\r\n  This parasite is variously referred to the genera _Nosema_ and\r\n  _Glugea_.\r\n\r\n  _Thélohania contejeani_, parasitic in the muscles of crayfish, is\r\n  believed by some to be the causal agent of recent epizoötics among\r\n  them, though others believe the disease to be really due to a\r\n  bacillus. It may be that the one organism aids in the entry of the\r\n  other into the host.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder. *Actinomyxidia*, Stolč.\r\n\r\n  A brief mention may be made of the Actinomyxidia (fig. 101), which\r\n  were first described by Stolč in 1899 as parasites of Oligochætes.\r\n  They have also been investigated by Mrazek, and a detailed study\r\n  of certain species was made by Caullery and Mesnil (1905). The\r\n  trophozoite is small and amœboid. The spores are large, and exhibit\r\n  tri-radiate symmetry. Spore formation is complicated and sexual\r\n  processes occur therein. Many amœbulæ are set free from each spore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 101.--Spore of _Hexactinomyxon psammoryctis_. At\r\ntop of figure three polar capsules, one with polar filament extended.\r\n× 450. (After Stolč.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder. *Sarcosporidia*, Balbiani.\r\n\r\n  The first member of this group was discovered by Miescher in 1843.\r\n  This author found white filaments running parallel with the direction\r\n  of the fibres in the voluntary muscles of mice. They were visible\r\n  to the naked eye, and proved to be cylindrical tubes tapering at\r\n  each end. They were as long as the muscular fibres, were enveloped\r\n  in a membrane, and contained innumerable elongate or kidney-shaped\r\n  bodies and a smaller number of little spherical forms. Th. v.\r\n  Hessling confirmed (1853) the occurrence of these “Miescher’s tubes”\r\n  within the muscular fibres, this author having discovered the same\r\n  structures in the heart muscles of deer, cattle, and sheep. Both\r\n  investigators considered them to be pathological transformations of\r\n  the muscles. v. Siebold, from his own experiences, regarded them as\r\n  fungus-like entophytes.\r\n\r\n  Rainey (1858) discovered similar structures in the muscular system\r\n  of pigs, and considered them to be early stages of _Cysticercus\r\n  cellulosæ_, which error Leuckart rectified, simultaneously\r\n  emphasizing their relationship with Myxosporidia. Both these authors\r\n  found them in the muscular fibres, and both observed that they\r\n  possessed a thick striated membrane. Manz (1867) published the\r\n  results of more minute investigations on the structure and contents\r\n  of the cylinders. This observer also recognized the disease in\r\n  rabbits and attempted to cultivate the parasites. He also tried to\r\n  induce experimental infection in guinea-pigs, rats, and mice, but the\r\n  result was negative.\r\n\r\n  However, domestic and wild mammals are not the only hosts of\r\n  Sarcosporidia; these parasites are also harboured by birds. Thus,\r\n  according to Kühn, they are found in the domestic fowl; according\r\n  to Rivolta in _Turdus_, _Corvus_, and other birds; according to\r\n  Stiles in North American birds; while Fantham found Sarcosporidia\r\n  in the African mouse-bird, _Colius_. Reptiles also are parasitized\r\n  occasionally. Bertram found them in the gecko, Lühe in the\r\n  wall-lizard. It was found also that the Sarcosporidia could develop\r\n  not only in the muscles but also in the connective tissue. This\r\n  led to the foundation of a new, but provisional, classification by\r\n  Blanchard, using the generic name _Miescheria_ for the parasites\r\n  in the muscles and _Balbiania_ for those in the connective tissue.\r\n  Finally, Sarcosporidia have also been observed in man.\r\n\r\n  The relation of these parasites to certain diseases of domestic\r\n  animals has been studied by veterinary surgeons. Sarcosporidia may\r\n  cause fatal epizoötics among sheep.\r\n\r\n  There is still a wide field open for research in regard to the\r\n  structure and development of these parasites, and the manner in which\r\n  the hosts become infected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 102.--Longitudinal section of a muscle of the\r\ndomestic pig, with _Sarcocystis miescheriana_. × 30. (After Kühn.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 103.--Transverse section of the muscle of a pig,\r\nwith _Sarcocystis miescheriana_. × 38. (After Kühn.)]\r\n\r\nThe Sarcosporidia usually appear as elongate, cylindrical, or fusiform\r\nbodies, rounded at both extremities and of various lengths and breadths\r\n(fig. 102). In some species they may be from 16 mm. to 50 mm. long, as\r\nin the sheep and roebuck. These bodies are the so-called sarcocysts or\r\nMiescher’s tubes. They lie in transversely striated muscular fibres\r\nwhich they distend more or less. The forms found in the connective\r\ntissue are apparently parasites which originally inhabited the muscular\r\nfibres, and only on disintegration of the fibres reached the connective\r\ntissue, where they grow to large oval or globular bodies (fig. 105).\r\nThe mammalian muscles usually infected are those of the œsophagus,\r\nlarynx, diaphragm, body-wall, and the psoas muscles. The skeletal\r\nmuscles may be affected in acute cases, as well as those of the tongue\r\nand eye. The heart muscles are sometimes parasitized.\r\n\r\n  In fresh material cut into thin slices the parasites are\r\n  frequently recognizable, even with the naked eye, because of their\r\n  yellowish-white colour. Under the microscope they appear to be\r\n  coarsely granular (fig. 103). Beginners may find some difficulty\r\n  in distinguishing them from other foreign bodies, such as dead and\r\n  calcified encapsuled Trichinæ, or from Cysticerci that have died\r\n  and become calcified in the early stages, more particularly as the\r\n  Sarcosporidia also occasionally may become calcified.\r\n\r\nThe Sarcosporidia are always enveloped in a membrane, which is\r\nprobably formed at an early stage. In a few cases it remains thin\r\nand simple, in other cases a radially striated ectoplasmic layer is\r\npresent (figs. 104, 108), which has been variously described. From the\r\ninner integument, which may be homogeneous or fibrous, thick or thin,\r\nmembranes or trabeculæ pass into the interior of the body, forming\r\nanastomosing partitions, and so producing a system of chambers of\r\nvarious sizes that do not communicate with one another (figs. 104,\r\n108). These chambers are occupied by sickle- or bean-shaped bodies\r\n(spores or sporozoites), or various developmental stages of them.\r\nThe oldest spores are found in the centre of the Miescher’s tubes or\r\ntrophozoites. If they are not liberated they die there, so that the\r\ncentral chambers of the tube are empty and hollow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 104.--_Sarcocystis miescheriana_ from pig. Late\r\nstage in which body is divided into numerous chambers or alveoli, each\r\ncontaining many spores. (From Wasielewski, after Manz.)]\r\n\r\nIn the youngest Sarcosporidia (40 µ in length) from the muscles of\r\nthe sheep there occur, according to Bertram, small roundish or oval\r\ncells (4 µ to 5 µ), the nuclei of which are half their size, and are\r\nembedded in a granular protoplasmic mass. In somewhat larger, and\r\ntherefore older, cylinders, the investing membrane of which already\r\nshows both layers, the cells have become larger (to 7 µ) and are more\r\nsharply outlined from each other (fig. 106). These uninucleate cells\r\nmay be considered as pansporoblasts. In each pansporoblast division\r\nof the nucleus occurs (fig. 107), and meanwhile the pansporoblasts\r\nbecome isolated within the chambers, the dividing partitions of which\r\noriginate from the granular protoplasm which is present between the\r\npansporoblasts. The numerous uninucleate daughter forms produced within\r\nthe chambers become spores direct (fig. 108).\r\n\r\nThe process commences in the centre of the cylinders or sarcocysts,\r\nand then progresses towards the extremities, the parasites meanwhile\r\nincreasing in size, and new pansporoblasts being continually formed at\r\nthe extremities (fig. 107).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 105.--Transverse section of _Sarcocystis tenella_,\r\nRaill.

(From Wasielewski,\r\nafter van Eecke.)]\r\n\r\nThe spores (sometimes called Rainey’s corpuscles), vary in shape\r\naccording to the species, but are also of different form individually.\r\nThey are mostly kidney-, bean- or sickle-shaped (fig. 109), and of\r\nsmall size, sometimes reaching 14 µ by 3 µ to 5 µ. They are apparently\r\nsurrounded by a thin membrane, and at one extremity (according to the\r\ndiscovery of L. Pfeiffer, confirmed by van Eecke, Laveran and Mesnil)\r\ncontain an obliquely striated body (fig. 109) often homologized with\r\nthe polar capsule, while the greater part of the spore is taken up by\r\nthe nucleate sporozoite. Several authors state that they have also\r\nobserved filamentous appendages (polar filaments) at one end of the\r\nspores, and have seen two kinds of spores in the same Sarcosporidium.\r\nSpores of various species of Sarcosporidia may contain metachromatic\r\ngranules, often centrally placed (fig. 109). These granules may be\r\nmetabolic or possibly may contain toxin (see below).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 109.--Spores of _Sarcocystis tenella_, Raill. _a_,\r\nfresh, showing the polar capsule; _b_, stained, showing metachromatic\r\ngranules and nucleus. × 1,000. (After Laveran and Mesnil.)]\r\n\r\nThe gymnospores of _Sarcocystis muris_, from the mouse, show active\r\nboring movements when kept in saline solution warmed to 35° or 37° C.\r\n_S. muris_ is very deadly to its host. From their structure the\r\nspores do not appear to have great powers of resistance to external\r\nconditions. They measure 12 µ by 3 µ to 4 µ or less.\r\n\r\nLaveran and Mesnil (1899) isolated a toxin from _S. tenella_ of\r\nthe sheep and called it sarcocystin. This substance is especially\r\npathogenic to experimental rabbits.\r\n\r\nThe duration of life of the Sarcosporidia is a comparatively long\r\none. The affected muscular fibres may remain intact and capable of\r\nperforming their functions for a long time, but at last they perish,\r\nif the host lives long enough. Thus the Sarcosporidia of the muscles\r\nare then enveloped only by sarcolemma, and finally, when this likewise\r\ndisappears, they fall into the intra-muscular connective tissue.\r\nIn many cases the Sarcosporidia die off within their hosts, this,\r\naccording to Bertram, being brought about by a disintegration of the\r\nspores in the central chambers. In other cases the leucocytes play a\r\npart in the destruction of the Sarcosporidia, and sometimes it happens\r\nthat lime salts are deposited in and around the vacant cylinders.\r\n\r\nIn some places pigs, sheep, mice and rats are infected with\r\nsarcosporidiosis to a remarkable extent, in certain cases almost\r\nreaching 100 per cent. Young animals also are infected, and perhaps\r\ninfection only takes place during youth.\r\n\r\nAlthough the natural mode of transmission of the Sarcosporidia remains\r\nto be determined, yet various experimental researches on the problem\r\nare of interest and importance. Theobald Smith (1901) found that mice\r\ncould be experimentally infected with _S. muris_ by feeding them with\r\nthe flesh of other infected mice. The incubation period was a long one,\r\nnamely forty to fifty days. Thus, on the forty-fifth day after feeding\r\nyoung Sarcosporidia were found, and seventy days after feeding spore\r\nformation began. Ripe spores were found two and a half to three months\r\nafter the commencement of these experiments. This mode of infection--a\r\ncannibalistic one--hardly seems likely to be the natural method for the\r\ninfection of sheep and ruminants generally. Smith’s researches have\r\nbeen confirmed. Nègre[225] (1910) found that the fæces of mice fed on\r\ninfected muscular tissue were infective to other mice when ingested by\r\nthem. Negri[226] infected guinea-pigs with _S. muris_ by feeding them\r\non infected mouse flesh, and found that the parasite in guinea-pigs\r\nshowed different characters from those exhibited by it in mice.\r\nDarling[227] also succeeded in infecting guinea-pigs with _S. muris_,\r\nand Erdmann infected mice with _S. tenella_ (from the sheep).\r\n\r\n[225] _C. R. Soc. Biol._, lxviii, p. 997.\r\n\r\n[226] _Centralbl. f. Bakt._, Orig., xlvii, p. 612; see also xlvii,\r\np. 56; lv, p. 373.\r\n\r\n[227] _Journ. Exptl. Med._, xii, p. 19.\r\n\r\nAccording to Erdmann[228] (1910) the Sarcosporidian spore germinates\r\nin the intestine of the host, which has recently ingested infected\r\nmaterial. The spore liberates its contained toxin--sarcocystin--which\r\nacts upon the adjacent intestinal epithelium, whereby the latter is\r\nshed, and an amœbula creeps out of the spore. The amœbula is able to\r\npenetrate the denuded area and get directly into the lymph-spaces of\r\nthe submucous coat of the intestine. The first period of development,\r\nlasting some twenty-eight to thirty days, is said to be passed in the\r\nlymph-spaces of the intestine. Later the amœbula reaches a muscle\r\nfibre. Writing in May, 1914, Erdmann[229] records the appearance of\r\nsmall amœboid and schizogony forms six days after infection of the\r\nhost. Crawley[230] (1913) controverts some of these statements and\r\nconsiders that the Sarcosporidian spore, still sickle-shaped, bores its\r\nway into the epithelial cells of the intestine and comes to rest there.\r\nThe spore then becomes round or elliptical, and peripheral masses of\r\nchromatin appear within it, suggesting schizogony. This happens about\r\ntwelve hours after feeding, and in twenty-four hours the spores appear\r\nto have left the intestine. More recently (May, 1914), Crawley[231]\r\nconsiders that there is sexual differentiation among the Sarcosporidian\r\nspores, a few hours after their ingestion by the host.\r\n\r\n[228] _Sitz. Gesell. naturf. Freunde zu Berlin_, p. 377.\r\n\r\n[229] _Proc. Soc. Exper. Biol. and Med._, xi, p. 152.\r\n\r\n[230] _Science_, xxxvii, p. 498.\r\n\r\n[231] _Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci._, Philadelphia, May, 1914, p. 432.\r\n\r\nInteresting discussions have occurred as to the site of the toxic\r\nsarcocystin within the spore. Metachromatic granules occur in the\r\nmiddle of the Sarcosporidian spore (fig. 109), and the toxin may be\r\ncontained in these grains, as they disappear, according to Erdmann,\r\nbefore the amœbula penetrates the denuded intestinal wall. However, a\r\npolar capsule, containing a polar filament, may be present at one end\r\nof a Sarcosporidian spore. Laveran and Mesnil described a striated\r\narea at the more pointed end of the spore of _S. tenella_, which area\r\nthey consider to represent a polar capsule. Fantham[232] (1913) found\r\na vacuole-like, polar capsule area in the spores of _S. colii_ from\r\nthe African mouse-bird. The sarcocystin may be contained in the polar\r\ncapsule. The nucleus of the spore is generally at the opposite, blunter\r\nend.\r\n\r\n[232] _Proc. Cambr. Philosoph. Soc._, xvii, p. 221.\r\n\r\nAgain, various authors have stated that Sarcosporidian spores may occur\r\nin the blood of the host at times. If so, then an intermediate host may\r\nbe concerned in their transmission. Perrin suggested that Sarcosporidia\r\nmight be spread by blow-flies and flesh-flies.\r\n\r\nThe classification of the Sarcosporidia as proposed by R. Blanchard,\r\nwhich was based on their various habitats, can no longer hold, because\r\nthe same species may occur in the muscles as well as in the connective\r\ntissue. For the present, the few species that are known may be placed\r\nin one genus, _Sarcocystis_, Ray Lankester, 1882.\r\n\r\nThe following species of _Sarcocystis_ are of interest:--\r\n\r\n_S. miescheriana_, Kühn, 1865, in the pig.\r\n\r\n_S. bertrami_, Doflein, 1901, in the horse.\r\n\r\n_S. tenella_, Railliet, 1886, in sheep. _S. tenella bubali_ in\r\nbuffaloes in Ceylon and Egypt.\r\n\r\n_S. blanchardi_, Doflein, 1901, in cattle.\r\n\r\n_S. muris_, Blanchard, 1885, in the mouse, to which it is lethal.\r\n\r\n_S. hueti_, Blanchard, 1885, in the seal.\r\n\r\n_S. colii_, Fantham, 1913, in the African mouse-bird, _Colius\r\nerythromelon_.\r\n\r\nAlso various Sarcosporidia from antelopes, monkeys, opossum, birds, the\r\ngecko and wall-lizard are known.\r\n\r\nThe spores of _S. muris_, _S. bertrami_, _S. tenella_, and _S. colii_\r\ncan multiply by longitudinal fission.\r\n\r\n\r\nSARCOSPORIDIA OBSERVED IN MAN.\r\n\r\n(1) Lindemann[233] found on the valves and in the myocardium of a\r\nperson who had died of dropsy certain brownish masses, 3 mm. in length\r\nand 1·5 mm. in breadth which he regarded as gregarines. If these were\r\nactually independent animal organisms it may be suggested that they\r\nwere Sarcosporidia. Rivolta (1878) named the species _S. lindemanni_.\r\n\r\n[233] “Ueb. d. hyg. Bdtg. d. Gregarinen,” _Dtsche. Ztschr. f.\r\nStaatsarzneikunde_, 1868, xxvi, p. 326.\r\n\r\n(2) Rosenberg[234] found a cyst 5 mm. in length and 2 mm. in breadth\r\nin a papillary muscle of the mitral valve of a woman, aged 40, who had\r\ndied from pleuritis and endocarditis. The cyst contained no scolex nor\r\nhooklets of tænia. Numerous small refracting bodies, round, oval or\r\nkidney-shaped, were found in a daughter cyst, as well as sickle-shaped\r\nbodies. The description hardly appears to indicate Sarcosporidia.\r\n\r\n[234] “Ein Befund von Psorosp. in Herzmusk d. Menschen,” _Ztschr. f.\r\nHygiene_, 1892, xi, p. 435.\r\n\r\n(3) Kartulis[235] observed Miescher’s cylinders of various sizes in the\r\nliver (?) and in the muscular system, of a Sudanese who had succumbed\r\nto multiple abscesses of the liver and abdominal muscles. This may be\r\nconsidered as the first actual case of the occurrence of Sarcosporidia\r\nin man. Koch in 1887 described a case in Egypt.\r\n\r\n[235] Kartulis, “Ueb. pathog. Protoz. b. Menschen,” _Ztschr. f. Hyg.\r\nu. Inf._, 1893, xiii, p. 1. Compare also Braun, M., _Die Thier. Par.\r\nd. Mensch._, 2nd Edit., Wrzbg., 1895, p. 92; Braun, M., “Z. Vork. d.\r\nSarcosp., b. Menschen,” _Centralbl. f. Bakt._ 1895, xviii, p. 13.\r\n\r\n(4) The case reported by Baraban and St. Remy[236] was at once\r\ndemonstrated as certain. It related to a man who had been executed,\r\nand in the laryngeal muscles of whom Sarcosporidia were found; the\r\nlength of the parasites varied between 150 µ and 1,600 µ, their breadth\r\nbetween 77 µ and 168 µ. The affected muscular fibres were distended\r\nto four times their normal thickness. This species was described by\r\nBlanchard as “_Miescheria_” _muris_, but according to Vuillemin, it was\r\nmore probably _Sarcocystis tenella_ of the sheep.\r\n\r\n[236] “Sur un cas de Tub. Psorosp. ob. chez l’homme,” _C. R. Soc.\r\nBiol._, Paris, 1894 (x), I, p. 201. “Le Parasitisme d. Sarcosp. chez\r\nl’homme,” _Bibliogr. Anat._ 1894, p. 79.\r\n\r\n(5) Vuillemin has also described a case of Sarcosporidia found in the\r\nmuscles of a man who died from tubercle at Nancy. The author considered\r\nthat the parasite corresponded to _S. tenella_.\r\n\r\n(6) Darling[237] (1909) found Sarcosporidia in the biceps of a negro\r\nfrom Barbados.\r\n\r\n[237] _Arch. Internal Med._, III, p. 183.\r\n\r\nThe Myxosporidia, Microsporidia, Actinomyxidia and possibly the\r\nSarcosporidia may be included within the section *Cnidosporidia*\r\n(Doflein), since they possess spores containing polar capsules.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder. *Haplosporidia*, Caullery and Mesnil.\r\n\r\n  The Haplosporidia are a group of organisms having both a simple\r\n  structure and life-history. The simplicity may represent a primitive\r\n  condition or may be due to degradation resultant on parasitism, and\r\n  thus it is possible that the group is not a homogeneous one. The\r\n  order Haplosporidia was created by Caullery and Mesnil in 1899, and\r\n  includes parasites of rotifers, annelids (fig. 110), crustacea, fish,\r\n  prochordates and man. They may be present in the body cavity or\r\n  alimentary tract, and can also occur in the septum nasi of man, in\r\n  the nervous system of Cephalodiscus, and in tumours of fish.\r\n\r\n  As the name implies, the spores of the Haplosporidia are simple,\r\n  without polar capsules, and are uninucleate. In some genera, _e.g._,\r\n  _Haplosporidium_, _Urosporidium_ (fig. 111) there is a spore-coat\r\n  or sporocyst which may be elongate or spiny. The developmental\r\n  cycle of a Haplosporidian, such as _Haplosporidium_ or _Bertramia_,\r\n  begins with a small, uninucleate cell, often rounded, possessing a\r\n  cell membrane that may be prolonged into processes. Growth takes\r\n  place, coupled with an increase in the number of nuclei, so that a\r\n  multinucleate trophozoite is produced. Later, this multinucleate\r\n  trophozoite becomes segmented into a number of ovoid or spherical\r\n  pansporoblasts, which give rise to few (one to four) spores. Such a\r\n  spore, when set free, begins the life cycle over again.\r\n\r\n  More recently (1905–1907) two important organisms have been\r\n  described and included in this group, namely, _Neurosporidium\r\n  cephalodisci_[238] (Ridewood and Fantham) from the nervous system\r\n  of the prochordate, _Cephalodiscus nigrescens_, and _Rhinosporidium\r\n  kinealyi_ (or _seeberi_) from the septum nasi of man. In the case of\r\n  _Rhinosporidium_ and _Neurosporidium_, after the uninucleate spore\r\n  has grown into a multinucleate trophozoite, the latter segments into\r\n  uninucleate pansporoblasts, as in the preceding cases. A difference\r\n  then occurs, for each pansporoblast enlarges, its nucleus divides\r\n  and a “spore-morula” is formed. Thus a multinucleate pansporoblast\r\n  or spore-morula, divided into many uninucleate sporoblasts (spore\r\n  mother cells) is produced, and each sporoblast without further change\r\n  becomes a uninucleate spore.\r\n\r\n[238] _Quart. Journ. Microsc. Sci._, li, p. 81.\r\n\r\n  The Haplosporidia have therefore been divided by Ridewood and Fantham\r\n  (1907)[239] into two sections:--\r\n\r\n[239] See Fantham, _Brit. Assoc. Reports_, 1907, p. 553.\r\n\r\n  (1) The _Polysporulea_, wherein the pansporoblast gives rise to\r\n  a number of spores (nine or more), _e.g._, _Rhinosporidium_,\r\n  _Neurosporidium_.\r\n\r\n  (2) The _Oligosporulea_, wherein the pansporoblasts give rise\r\n  each to a few (four) spores or to only a single spore, _e.g._,\r\n  _Haplosporidium_, _Bertramia_, _Cœlosporidium_, _Ichthyosporidium_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 110.--_Haplosporidium heterocirri._ Section\r\nthroughout wall of the Polychæte worm, _Heterocirrus viridis_, showing\r\nvarious developmental stages of the Haplosporidium. × 550.

(After Caullery\r\nand Mesnil.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n*Rhinosporidium kinealyi*, Minchin and Fantham, 1905.\r\n\r\n_Rhinosporidium kinealyi_, parasitic in man, must now be considered in\r\ngreater detail. This organism was found in nasal polypus in India, and\r\nhas since been recorded from the ear as small nodules in the external\r\nauditory meatus. The Indian cases came from the neighbourhoods of\r\nCalcutta and Madras, and the parasite has been seen in Ceylon. Similar\r\nstructures have since been described from the United States and South\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThe Rhinosporidium polypus is said not to be particularly painful,\r\nthough nasal forms must interfere with breathing to some extent. The\r\nfirst nasal polyp reported from India formed a vascular pedunculated\r\ngrowth on the septum nasi and was about the size of a large pea or\r\nraspberry. It was compared with a raspberry, being red in colour with a\r\nnumber of small whitish dots upon its surface. When the tumour was cut,\r\na number of similar whitish dots were seen within. These were the cysts\r\nof Rhinosporidium. According to Minchin and Fantham[240] (1905), they\r\nvary considerably in size and measure up to 200 µ or 250 µ in diameter.\r\nEach possesses a cyst wall which varies in thickness in different\r\ncysts. Its outer wall is always firm and distinct, the inner limit\r\nbeing less definite at times. Each large cyst is filled with numbers of\r\nspherical or oval bodies, showing every gradation between small ones at\r\nthe periphery and large ones at the centre (fig. 112). Roughly, three\r\nzones of parasites can be distinguished in a large cyst, a peripheral\r\nset consisting of the youngest parasites, an intermediate group and a\r\ncentral, oldest zone. A large cyst may possess a pore for the egress of\r\nits contents. Some of the cysts show polar distribution of the zones.\r\n\r\n[240] _Quart. Journ. Microsc. Sci._, xlix, p. 521.\r\n\r\nThe youngest forms of Rhinosporidium are difficult to detect. They are\r\nsmall, granular masses, round, ovoid or irregular and at times even\r\namœboid in appearance. These are young trophozoites. They increase in\r\nsize, but encystment occurs early, the outer layer becoming firm so\r\nthat the organisms have a definite contour. Each is soon multinucleate\r\nand the cytoplasm segments around the nuclei. The cyst thus becomes\r\nfull of uninucleate pansporoblasts or sporonts, with a peripheral\r\nlayer of undifferentiated protoplasm. The pansporoblasts grow in size.\r\nIn the larger cysts the formation of pansporoblasts progresses at\r\nthe expense of the peripheral layer of protoplasm, which, however,\r\ncontinues to grow, so that the cyst as a whole increases in size. The\r\npansporoblasts at first are uninucleate (fig. 112, _a_), and then\r\nundergo nuclear multiplication. This is well seen in the intermediate\r\nzone of parasites, where the pansporoblasts show first one, then two,\r\nthen four or more spores (fig. 112, _b_), while in the oldest centrally\r\nplaced pansporoblasts, about a dozen or sixteen closely packed spores\r\n(fig. 112, _c_), can be seen. The spore is small and rounded, and its\r\nnucleus is clear and distinct. The fully formed pansporoblast or spore\r\nmorula becomes surrounded by a membrane.\r\n\r\nCertain of the cysts have been found in a ruptured condition, whereby\r\nthe spores have been liberated into the surrounding tissue. It is\r\nalmost certain that the spores serve for the auto-infection of the\r\nhost, for though the tumours of Rhinosporidium seemed to have been\r\nremoved entirely, it has been found that they recur, some minute\r\nfragment of the parasite having probably been left behind. The method\r\nwhereby the parasite reaches new hosts has not yet been determined,\r\nand it would be of interest if its life-history could be more fully\r\ninvestigated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 112.--_Rhinosporidium kinealyi._ Portion of ripe\r\ncyst containing pansporoblasts of various ages. × 480. (After Minchin\r\nand Fantham.)]\r\n\r\nThe Asiatic specimens of _R. kinealyi_ were first described in detail\r\nby Minchin and Fantham (1905) from material briefly reported to the\r\nLaryngological Society of London in 1903, by O’Kinealy. Material\r\nobtained by Dr. Nair, of Madras, was described by Beattie[241] in 1906.\r\nThis material came from Cochin. Castellani and Chalmers have found\r\nsimilar polypi in Ceylon.\r\n\r\n[241] _Journ. Pathol. and Bacteriol._, xi, p. 270; and _Brit. Med.\r\nJourn._, Nov. 16, 1907, p. 1402.\r\n\r\nWright[242] has described the parasite from Memphis, Tennessee.\r\nSeeber[243] in 1896 described nasal polypi in Buenos Ayres, and in\r\n1900 Wernicke named the parasite therein _Coccidium seeberi_. Seeber’s\r\nparasite is a Rhinosporidium, _R. seeberi_, and may ultimately be found\r\nto be the same as _R. kinealyi_. Ingram[244] reports Rhinosporidium\r\ncysts, with pores in the cyst walls, in conjunctival polypus and in\r\npapilloma of the penis in India. Zschokke has reported the presence of\r\n_Rhinosporidium_ in horses in South Africa.\r\n\r\n[242] _New York Med. Journ._, December 21, 1907, p. 1149.\r\n\r\n[243] _La Ciencia Medica_ (Buenos Ayres), 1912.\r\n\r\n[244] _Lancet_, September 3, 1910, p. 726.\r\n\r\n\r\nClass IV. *INFUSORIA*, Ledermüller, 1763.\r\n\r\nThe Infusoria (or Heterokaryota, Hickson, or Ciliophora, Doflein)\r\ninclude the Ciliata and the Suctoria. A few authorities, including\r\nBraun, raise the Suctoria (or Acinetaria) to separate rank as a class,\r\nbut this is not widely followed.\r\n\r\nThe body of the Ciliata usually is bilaterally symmetrical and is\r\nenveloped in a cuticle which has numerous openings for the protrusion\r\nof the cilia. Most kinds have a fixed shape, whilst changes in the form\r\nof others are brought about by the contractions of the body substance.\r\nThe latter exhibits hyaline ectoplasm, in which myonemes, and\r\noccasionally also trichocysts (minute spindle-shaped bodies) appear,\r\nand granular endoplasm which may contain numerous vacuoles. The cilia,\r\non whose various arrangements the classification is based, are always\r\nprocesses of the ectoplasm. Their form varies; they may be hair-like,\r\nor more rarely thorn-like, spur-like, or hook-shaped; undulatory\r\nmembranes also may occur, which are probably composed of fused cilia.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of some of the parasitic species, an oral cavity,\r\nperistome or cytostome, is always present. It is frequently beset with\r\ncilia or provided with undulatory membranes, which help to waft the\r\nfood inwards; sometimes there is an anal aperture (cytopyge) generally\r\nplaced at the opposite pole of the organism. A cytopharynx fringed with\r\ncilia or sometimes with a specialized supporting apparatus is connected\r\nwith the peristome. Vacuoles form round the ingested food, and in many\r\nspecies a constant rotation goes on in the endoplasm. Often one, and\r\nsometimes two contractile vacuoles are present, the frequency of the\r\npulsations of which depends on the surrounding temperature. Sometimes\r\nspecial conducting channels lead to the vacuoles, or there are outlet\r\nchannels leading to the exterior.\r\n\r\nThere is in almost every case a large nucleus (macronucleus), and lying\r\nclose up to it a small nucleus (micronucleus). The form of the large\r\nnucleus varies according to the species. Numerous nuclei are not very\r\ncommon, but these occur in _Opalina_, which lives in the hind-gut of\r\namphibia, and is also distinguished by the absence of an oral aperture.\r\n\r\nReproduction is effected by binary fission; less commonly, after\r\nencystment, by multiple division, or by budding. The divisions can\r\nbe repeated many times, but finally cease, and then the conjugation\r\nof two specimens brings about a regeneration, particularly of the\r\nnuclei. Numerous examinations (Bütschli, Hertwig, Maupas, Calkins) have\r\ndemonstrated that after two individuals have associated by homologous\r\nparts of the body, the micronucleus separates from the macronucleus,\r\nbecomes larger and divides twice by mitosis, so that four micronuclei\r\nare present in each one of the two individuals forming the couple.\r\nThree of these nuclei perish and become absorbed, the fourth gradually\r\npasses to the portion of protoplasm connecting the two conjugants,\r\nwhich has originated by absorption of the cuticle at the point of\r\ncontact of the conjugants. After a further division one micronucleus of\r\neach conjugant passes over into the other conjugant, and fusion ensues\r\nbetween the two micronuclei of each individual. Complicated changes and\r\ndivisions may occur, but only the main principles can be noted here.\r\nA new nuclear body is thus formed in each conjugant, and soon divides\r\ninto two. Of the segments thus produced one becomes a micronucleus, and\r\none or several of the others, as the case may be, form or amalgamate\r\ninto a new macronucleus, the old macronucleus usually perishing or\r\nbecoming absorbed during the conjugation. Usually, sooner or later,\r\nthe two conjugants separate, or may have separated already, and again\r\nmultiply independently by fission until a series of divisions by simple\r\nfission is again followed by conjugation. The theoretical significance\r\nof conjugation cannot be dealt with fully here. It may be remarked,\r\nhowever, that the macronucleus plays no part in it, but governs\r\nentirely the metabolism of the Infusorian, whereas the micronucleus is\r\nessentially a generative nucleus from which macro- and micro-nuclei are\r\nagain and again produced.\r\n\r\nEncystment amongst the Infusoria is very general, and is essentially\r\na means of protection when the surrounding medium dries up. Doubtless\r\nthese cysts are frequently carried long distances by the wind, which\r\nexplains the wide geographical distribution of most species. Also,\r\nmultiplication often takes place in the encysted condition.\r\n\r\nSome Infusoria live a free life, others are sedentary; the latter\r\nform colonies in fresh as well as in salt water. Numerous species are\r\nparasites of various lower and higher animals,[245] and a few also are\r\nparasitic in man.\r\n\r\n[245] It may be stated that numerous peculiarly shaped species live\r\nin the stomach of ruminants, others in the colon of horses. Several\r\nspecies are found in the rectum of frogs and toads; others, again, on\r\nthe surface of the bodies of fishes; and various other species exist in\r\nand on the bodies of invertebrate animals.\r\n\r\nThe Prague zoologist, v. Stein, introduced a classification of the\r\nInfusoria that has been almost universally adopted. It is founded on\r\nthe different position of the cilia on the body. Though, no doubt,\r\nartificial, it is a convenient system. Bütschli has compiled a better\r\none.[246] But for our purpose Stein’s system is sufficient:--\r\n\r\n[246] Bronn’s _Cl. u. Ordn. d. Thierr._, i, Protozoa, Part 3, Infusoria.\r\n\r\n  Order 1. _Holotricha_, Infusoria with cilia that are evenly\r\n  distributed over the entire body.\r\n\r\n  Order 2. _Heterotricha_, ciliated all over like the _Holotricha_, but\r\n  having stouter cilia about the peristome.\r\n\r\n  Order 3. _Hypotricha_, only ciliated on the ventral surface.\r\n\r\n  Order 4. _Peritricha_, with only a ring of spiral cilia, mostly\r\n  sedentary.\r\n\r\nThe Infusoria observed in man belong to the order _Heterotricha_, with\r\nfew exceptions.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Balantidium*, Claparède et Lachmann.\r\n\r\n  Heterotrichous Infusoria of oval or bag-like form and almost circular\r\n  on transverse section; the anterior extremity narrowed, the posterior\r\n  end broad and rounded off, or also narrowed; the peristome starting\r\n  at the anterior end is broadest there and becomes narrower as it\r\n  gradually obliquely approaches towards the posterior extremity. There\r\n  are coarse cilia along the entire left border and the anterior part\r\n  of the right border. Longitudinal striation is distinct and regular.\r\n  There are two contractile vacuoles on the right, and occasionally\r\n  also two or more to the left. The anus (cytopyge) is terminal. The\r\n  macronucleus is usually horse-shoe or kidney-shaped, sometimes oval;\r\n  the micronucleus contiguous. Reproduction is by binary fission and\r\n  conjugation, and encystment occurs. The cysts are spherical or oval.\r\n  These ciliates are parasitic in the large intestine of human beings\r\n  and pigs, in Amphibia, and in the body cavity of polychæte Annelida.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Balantidium coli*, Malmsten, 1857.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Paramæcium coli_, Malmsten, 1857.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 113.--_Balantidium coli._ _a_, nucleus; _b_,\r\nvacuole; _c_, peristome; _d_, bolus of food. (After Leuckart.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 114.--_Balantidium coli_, free and encysted;\r\n_a_, anus or cytopyge; _n_, macronucleus; _b_, bolus of food. (After\r\nCasagrandi and Barbagallo.)]\r\n\r\nThe body is oval, 60 µ to 100 µ in length (up to 200 µ according to\r\nJanowski), and 50 µ to 70 µ in breadth. The peristome is funnel-shaped\r\nor contracted, the anterior end being then broadened or pointed\r\naccording to the degree of contraction (figs. 113, 114). The ecto- and\r\nendo-plasm are distinct, the latter is granular, containing drops of\r\nfat and mucus, granules of starch, bacteria, and occasionally also red\r\nand white blood corpuscles. There are usually two contractile vacuoles,\r\nseldom more. The anus (cytopyge) opens at the posterior extremity. The\r\nmacronucleus is bean- or kidney-shaped, rarely oval; the micronucleus\r\nis spherical.\r\n\r\n_Balantidium coli_ lives in the large intestine of man, in the rectum\r\nof the domestic pig, and has been found in monkeys. It propagates by\r\ntransverse division, but conjugation and encystment are known to take\r\nplace.[247] Transmission to other hosts is effected by the cysts of the\r\nparasite (fig. 114).\r\n\r\n[247] According to Gourvitch (“Bal. coli. Darmk. d. Menschen,” _Russ.\r\nArch. f. Path., klin. med. u. Bact._, Petrograd, 1896), the conjugated\r\nBalantidia are supposed to fuse with each other and form oval cysts\r\ntwo or three times the size of the free organisms, and to divide into\r\nnumerous globules within the cystic membrane; the process, however, has\r\nhitherto not been confirmed. The supposed Balantidium cysts appeared in\r\ntwo patients who were simultaneously suffering from _Dibothriocephalus\r\nlatus_, after the administration of anthelminthics. It therefore seems,\r\naccording to the description, that in reality these forms were actually\r\nabnormally large, possibly swollen, young eggs of the tape-worm\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n_Balantidium coli_, first seen by Leeuwenhoek, was described by\r\nMalmsten in 1857 in a man aged 35 years, who had two years previously\r\nsuffered from cholera, and since then had been subject to diarrhœa. The\r\nexamination showed an ulcer in the rectum above the mid sphincter ani,\r\nin the sanguineous purulent secretion of which numerous Balantidia were\r\nswimming about. Although the ulcer was made to heal, the diarrhœa did\r\nnot cease and the stools contained numerous Balantidia, the number of\r\nwhich could only be decreased by extensive enemas of hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\nThe second case related to a woman who was suffering from severe\r\ncolitis, and who died ten days after admission. The malodorous, watery\r\nevacuations contained innumerable Balantidia, in addition to pus, and\r\nat the autopsy the anterior portion of the large intestine was found to\r\nbe infested with them.\r\n\r\nSubsequently this parasite has often been observed in human beings,\r\nand various cases have been recorded. These occurred in Russia,\r\nScandinavia, Finland, Cochin China, Italy, Germany, Serbia, Sunda\r\nIslands, Philippine Islands, China, and in other parts of Asia and in\r\nAmerica. Other cases were reported by Askanazy, Ehrnroth, Klimenko,\r\nNagel, Koslowsky, Kossler, Waljeff, Strong and Musgrave, Glaessner[248]\r\nand others. Sievers found _B. coli_ very common in Finland.\r\n\r\n[248] _Centralbl. f. Bakt._, Orig., xlvii, p. 351.\r\n\r\nIn the majority of the cases described by Sievers from Finland,\r\nand in other cases from Central Europe, the patients suffered from\r\nobstinate intestinal catarrh, which did not always cease even after\r\nthe Balantidia had disappeared. On the other hand, Balantidia have\r\noccasionally still been found to persist, though in small numbers,\r\nafter the catarrh has been cured. Some authors, nevertheless, do\r\nnot regard Balantidia as the primary cause of the various diseases\r\nof the large intestine, which often commence with the development of\r\nulcers, but they consider that they may aggravate these diseases and\r\nrender them obstinate. According to Solowjew, Askanazy, Klimenko and\r\nStrong and Musgrave, however, the parasites penetrate the intestinal\r\nwall, and give rise to ulcerations which may extend deeply into the\r\nsubmucosa, and even be found in the blood and lymphatic vessels of the\r\nintestinal wall. According to Stokvis, _B. coli_ occurs also in the\r\nlung; at all events this author states that he found one living and\r\nseveral dead paramæcia (?) in the sputum of a soldier, returned from\r\nthe Sunda Islands, who was suffering from a pulmonary abscess. Sievers\r\nhas shown that _B. coli_ might occur in persons not suffering from\r\nintestinal complaints, but E. L. Walker[249] (1913) states that every\r\nperson parasitised with _B. coli_ is liable sooner or later to develop\r\nbalantidian dysentery.\r\n\r\n[249] _Philip. Jl. Sc._, Sec. B, viii, p. 333.\r\n\r\nSince Leuckart confirmed the frequent presence of _B. coli_ in the\r\nrectum of pigs, and corresponding observations were made in other\r\ncountries, the pig is universally considered to be the means of the\r\ntransmission of Balantidium to man. The encysted stages only serve\r\nfor transmission, because, according to all observations, the free\r\nparasites have a very small power of resistance. They perish when the\r\nfæces have become cool; they cannot live in ordinary, slimy, or salt\r\nwater. As they are killed by acids even when much diluted, they cannot\r\npass through the normal stomach alive except under the most unusual\r\ncircumstances. The pigs, in whose intestines the Balantidium appears to\r\ncause little or no disturbance, evacuate numerous encysted Balantidia\r\nwith the fæces, and their occasional transference to man brings about\r\ntheir colonization there, but perhaps only when a disease of the colon\r\nalready exists.\r\n\r\nExperimental transmission of the free parasites to animals (per os\r\nor per anum) yielded negative results, even in the case of pigs.\r\nCasagrandi and Barbagallo (1896), however, had positive, as well as\r\nnegative, results. They employed healthy young cats, or cats in which\r\ncatarrhal entero-colitis had been artificially induced (which in other\r\nexperiments is apt to cause the death of the animals experimented upon\r\nin about six or seven days), or finally cats that had dilatation of\r\nthe rectum with alkaline reaction of the fæces. An attempt to infect\r\nthree healthy cats by injecting human fæces containing Balantidium\r\ninto the rectum proved negative, in so far as the fæces of the\r\nexperimental animals had an acid reaction and contained no Balantidia,\r\nbut at the autopsy performed eight days after infection a few encysted\r\nparasites were found in the mucus of the ileum. In the case of four\r\ncats suffering from entero-colitis, into which human fæces containing\r\nBalantidia were introduced per os, Balantidium cysts were found in the\r\nfæces three days after the last ingestion. Great numbers, moreover,\r\nwere found in the cæcum and the posterior part of the small intestine\r\nat the autopsy of the animals, which died about eight days after the\r\ncommencement of the experiments. Actual colonization, therefore,\r\nwas not effected in either series of experiments. Free or encysted\r\nBalantidia of pigs were used for further experiments. The experiments\r\nproved negative when fæces containing cysts were injected into the\r\nrectum of healthy cats (three experiments), or cats (two) suffering\r\nfrom spontaneous intestinal catarrh, or when such material was\r\nintroduced per os into three healthy cats. In the case of two cats\r\nwith intestinal catarrh artificially produced, a small number of the\r\nactive Balantidia injected into the rectum remained alive. Larger\r\nquantities of fæces containing encysted Balantidia were introduced into\r\ntwo other cats affected with the same complaint. These, certainly, did\r\nnot appear in the fæces, but small numbers, free and alive, were found\r\nin the cæcum. Similarly, encysted Balantidia were introduced into two\r\ncats with dilated rectum, and whose fæces had an alkaline reaction.\r\nIn these cases no parasites appeared in the fæces, but three and five\r\ndays later, when the two animals were examined, a very small number\r\nwere discovered free in the large intestine. Klimenko did not succeed\r\nin infection experiments with _B. coli_ on young dogs, whose intestines\r\nhad been artificially affected by disease.\r\n\r\nMore recent experiments by Brumpt have shown that young sucking pigs\r\ncan be infected with Balantidium from infected monkeys (_Macacus\r\ncynomolgus_) and suffer heavily from the same, whereas the Balantidium\r\nof the pig is rarely harmful to its host. This and previous experiments\r\nmay be thought to suggest that there are perhaps several pathogenic\r\nspecies, and also that harmless strains of Balantidium may occur.\r\nAt the same time, it must be remembered that a large proportion of\r\nthe cases recorded of Balantidian colitis occur among swineherds\r\nand butchers, that is, among people in frequent contact with pigs.\r\nMorphologically, there are practically no differences between the\r\nBalantidia found in man, monkeys and pigs, and it is probable that\r\none species only, under slightly different environmental conditions,\r\nmay be responsible for the colitis observed. In any case, efficient\r\nprophylactic measures should be taken against balantidiasis in\r\ncountries where it may occur, by confining the pigs and not allowing\r\nthem to run in yards and dwellings.\r\n\r\nE. L. Walker (1913) has given a good summary of work on balantidiasis.\r\nHis own researches in the Philippines showed that monkeys could be\r\ninfected by Balantidia both from pigs and men. Parasites may appear\r\nin the stools only at infrequent intervals. He believes that the\r\nciliates are the primary etiologic factor in the symptoms and lesions\r\nof balantidian dysentery.\r\n\r\nBehrenroth (1913) has given an interesting account of _Balantidium\r\ncoli_ and its pathogenic significance.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Balantidium minutum*, Schaudinn, 1899.\r\n\r\nThe body is of oval form, with the anterior extremity pointed, and\r\nposterior extremity broad and rounded (fig. 115). The length is 20 µ\r\nto 32 µ, and the breadth is 14 µ to 20 µ. The peristome, which is\r\nfissure-like, extends to the centre of the body (fig. 115). The right\r\nlateral border of the peristome is beset with cilia the same length as\r\nthose of the body, the left side terminates in a thin hyaline membrane\r\nthat extends towards the back, and can pass over to the right side. A\r\nrow of longer and stronger cilia (cirri) are on the left border of the\r\nperistome. The cuticle is refractile, the ectoplasm hyaline and the\r\nendoplasm granular, with numerous food vacuoles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 115.--_Balantidium minutum._ _P_, peristome; _N_,\r\nnucleus; _M_, micronucleus; _V_, contractile vacuole. Food vacuoles are\r\nrepresented in the endoplasm. (After Schaudinn.)]\r\n\r\nA single contractile vacuole lies dorsally and to one side at the\r\nposterior extremity. The macronucleus, which is always spherical, is\r\ncentral and is 6 µ to 7 µ in diameter. The micronucleus, close in front\r\nof it, only measures 1 µ (fig. 115). The cysts are oval.\r\n\r\nThese parasites were found in numbers in the evacuations of a man\r\naged 30, who was born in Germany and had repeatedly travelled between\r\nHamburg and North America, where he made long stays. The patient came\r\nto the Charité in Berlin to seek advice for constipation alternating\r\nwith diarrhœa accompanied by abdominal pain.\r\n\r\nA second case (the parasite of which was described as _Colpoda\r\ncucullus_ by Schulz) was observed in a patient in the same institution.\r\n\r\nAs, in both cases, the parasites only appeared during the diarrhœa,\r\nand disappeared as soon as the fæces had assumed a normal consistency,\r\nor could only be demonstrated in a few encysted specimens, it may be\r\nassumed that the small intestine or the duodenum is their habitat.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Nyctotherus*, Leidy, 1849.\r\n\r\n  Flat, heterotrichous Infusoria, kidney- or bean-shaped. The peristome\r\n  commences at the anterior pole of the body and extends along the\r\n  concave side to the middle, where the oral aperture is situated. The\r\n  cytopharynx is oblique and is more or less curved. The cytopyge is at\r\n  the posterior extremity, where a single contractile vacuole is also\r\n  situated. The macronucleus is almost in the centre of the parasite.\r\n  The members of this genus live parasitically in the intestine of\r\n  amphibia, insects and myriapods, and at least one species is found in\r\n  man.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Nyctotherus faba*, Schaudinn, 1899.\r\n\r\nThe body is bean-shaped, and a little flattened dorso-ventrally. It\r\nis 26 µ to 28 µ long, 16 µ to 18 µ broad, and 10 µ to 12 µ thick\r\n(fig. 116). The peristome is on the right border and extends to the\r\nmiddle; at the left there are large adoral cilia, the cilia on the\r\nright border not being larger than those on the body. The cytopharynx\r\nis short, slightly curved and turned backwards. The contractile vacuole\r\nis large, spherical, situated at the posterior extremity, and its\r\ncontents are voided through the anus at its left. The macronucleus is\r\nin the centre of the body; it is globular (6 µ to 7 µ in size), and\r\ncontains four or five chromatin masses. The micronucleus lies close\r\nto it, and is spherical or somewhat elongate measuring 1 µ to 1·5 µ\r\n(fig. 116). The cysts are oval.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 116.--_Nyctotherus faba._ _P_, peristome;\r\n_N_, nucleus; _M_, micronucleus; _V_, contractile vacuole. (After\r\nSchaudinn.)]\r\n\r\nThis species has hitherto only been seen once in the same patient in\r\nwhom _Balantidium minutum_ was discovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Nyctotherus giganteus*, P. Krause, 1906.\r\n\r\nUnder the name _Balantidium giganteum_ n. sp., P. Krause described\r\nan Infusorian which was repeatedly observed with _Trichomonas\r\nintestinalis_ in the alkaline evacuations of a typhoid patient in\r\nBreslau. The body is ovoid, narrower and rounded anteriorly and\r\nbroader and stunted posteriorly. The peristome lies to one side; the\r\nmacronucleus is bean-shaped, the micronucleus small and globular;\r\none or two vacuoles are present. The anus is at the farther end. The\r\norganism is 90 µ to 400 µ long, 60 µ to 150 µ broad (fig. 117). After\r\na prolonged stay outside the body, it becomes rounded and encystment\r\noccurs. In the thermostat the Infusoria remain alive at 37° C. for five\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\nThe species, however, hardly belongs to _Balantidium_, but to all\r\nappearances is a _Nyctotherus_ and is distinguished from _N. faba_ by\r\nthe difference in size.\r\n\r\n\r\n[*Nyctotherus*] *africanus*, Castellani, 1905.\r\n\r\nIn the fæces of a native of Uganda who suffered from sleeping sickness\r\nand diarrhœa and had in his intestine _Ascaris lumbricoides_,\r\n_Trichocephalus trichiurus_ and _Ancylostoma duodenale_, Castellani\r\nfound a curiously shaped Infusorian, 40 µ to 50 µ long, and 35 µ\r\nto 40 µ broad, with spherical macro- and micronucleus and a\r\ncontractile vacuole (fig. 118). He included the organism in the genus\r\n_Nyctotherus_, perhaps wrongly, or the parasite may have been deformed.\r\nAfter the patient’s death the same parasite was found in the intestine\r\nand especially in the cæcum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 117.--_Nyctotherus giganteus._ (After Krause.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 118.--_Nyctotherus africanus._ (After Castellani.)]\r\n\r\n  G. Lindner, in Cassel, studied certain peritrichal Infusoria\r\n  (stalkless Vorticella), and connected them, probably incorrectly,\r\n  with the most varied diseases of man and domestic animals, even\r\n  with Sarcosporidia of pigs. It may be mentioned that according to a\r\n  communication by letter from Schaudinn, Vorticella may be found in\r\n  freshly evacuated fæces, but always only after the administration of\r\n  a water enema. In spite of this, several other investigators mention\r\n  Vorticellæ as intestinal parasites of man.\r\n\r\n  The _Chilodon dentatus_ (Ehrenberg) recorded in 1903 by J. Guiart as\r\n  a parasite of man, which may be found in all infusions, can hardly\r\n  have lived in the man from whose fæces it was cultivated, but may\r\n  represent a chance admixture both in the fæces and the cultivations.\r\n  _C. uncinatus_ was also found as a chance parasite of man by Manson\r\n  and Sambon. According to Doflein[250] (1911) certain Chilodon-like\r\n  organisms have been found by Selenew in prostate secretions in\r\n  gonorrhœa. Other species of the genus _Chilodon_ are known, but only\r\n  as ectoparasites (_e.g._, _Chilodon cyprini_, Moroff, 1902, from the\r\n  skin and gills of diseased carp).\r\n\r\n[250] _Lehrbuch der Protozoenkunde_, 3rd ed., p. 963.\r\n\r\n  A number of other parasitic Ciliates are known, among which\r\n  _Ichthyophthirius multifiliis_, destructive to fish, is important. It\r\n  lives in the skin and the layers immediately below it, forming small\r\n  whitish pustules which may become confluent. The pustules are most\r\n  common on the head and fins, but occur also on the eyes and gills of\r\n  the host. The young parasite, which is one of many formed in a cyst,\r\n  is very small. At first it is free swimming, but soon attaches itself\r\n  to the skin of a fish. It bores inwards and becomes surrounded by the\r\n  irritated skin. There it attains a relatively large size, being 500 µ\r\n  to 750 µ and occasionally more in diameter. The body has a rounded\r\n  terminal mouth, short cytopharynx and a number of minute contractile\r\n  vacuoles. The macronucleus is large and horseshoe-shaped; the small\r\n  micronucleus is only seen in the very young animal. When full grown,\r\n  the organism encysts and forces its way to the surface and bursts\r\n  through, leaving a small, gaping wound behind. The cyst sinks to the\r\n  bottom of the water, nuclear multiplication occurs and a number of\r\n  young parasites are produced, which leave the cyst and either attack\r\n  new hosts or else perish.\r\n\r\n  _Opalina ranarum_, parasitic in the rectum and urinary bladder of\r\n  frogs and toads, shows great degradation and simplification due\r\n  to parasitism, possessing no separate micronuclei, no cytostome,\r\n  cytopharynx or cytopyge. It has many macronuclei, and is a large\r\n  parasite. During summer and autumn nuclear multiplication followed\r\n  by division of the body occurs, the process being repeated after the\r\n  daughter forms have grown to the size of their parent. In spring, the\r\n  Opalina divide rapidly, but do not grow much before dividing again.\r\n  Finally, tiny forms, containing three to six nuclei, encyst and pass\r\n  from the host with the fæces. As these latter are greedily devoured\r\n  by tadpoles, the _Opalina_ gain new hosts in which they develop.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHLAMYDOZOA.\r\n\r\nThe name Chlamydozoa was proposed by Prowazek in 1907 for a number of\r\nminute, problematic organisms (fig. 119) believed to be the causal\r\nagents of certain diseases in man and animals, such as vaccinia\r\nand variola, trachoma, inclusion blenorrhœa in infants, molluscum\r\ncontagiosum, and bird epithelioma contagiosum. Other diseases possibly\r\ndue to Chlamydozoa[251] are hydrophobia, measles, scarlet fever,\r\nfoot-and-mouth disease, the “Gelbsucht” disease of silkworms, and\r\nperhaps even typhus (Prowazek, 1913). The subject is difficult and\r\ncontroversial and can only be briefly discussed here. It is known that\r\nthe viruses in all these diseases can pass through ordinary bacterial\r\nfilters, that is, they belong to the group of “filterable viruses.”\r\nAt such periods the organisms are extracellular or free. It is also\r\nknown that in many of these cases the virus produces definite and\r\ncharacteristic reaction-products or cell-inclusions in the infected\r\ncells, during the intracellular phase of the life-history of the\r\norganism. As the organisms to be considered are problematic, it will be\r\nconvenient to summarize their history:--\r\n\r\n[251] For a detailed account of the Chlamydozoa see Prowazek’s\r\n_Handbuch der Pathogenen Protozoen_, Bd. i (1911–12). Leipzig, J. A.\r\nBarth.\r\n\r\n(1) Cell-inclusions, usually named after their discoverers, have been\r\nfound in certain diseases, thus: In vaccinia Guarnieri’s bodies, in\r\nscarlet fever Mallory’s bodies, in hydrophobia Negri’s bodies, in\r\ntrachoma Prowazek’s bodies occur.\r\n\r\n(2) At first these characteristic cell-inclusions were considered to\r\nbe actual parasitic organisms causing the diseases in question. The\r\nbodies received zoological names and attempts were made to work out\r\ntheir supposed development cycles. The supposed parasites of vaccinia\r\nand variola were referred to a so-called genus _Cytoryctes_, those\r\nof hydrophobia to _Neuroryctes_, of scarlet fever to _Cyclasterium_,\r\nwhile those of molluscum contagiosum were referred to the Coccidia.\r\nCalkins in 1904 studied in detail the cell-inclusions of vaccinia\r\nand small-pox, calling them _Cytoryctes variolæ_, Guarnieri. Calkins\r\nconsidered that in the stratified cells of the epidermis they passed\r\nthrough two cycles, the one cytoplasmic, the other intranuclear. The\r\nfirst is the vaccinia cycle, the second the pathogenic (intranuclear)\r\nvariola cycle. It is hardly necessary to follow all Calkins’ stages\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nNegri (1909) described a cycle for _Neuroryctes hydrophobiæ_. Calkins\r\nrefers both _Cytoryctes variolæ_ and _Neuroryctes hydrophobiæ_ to the\r\nRhizopoda.\r\n\r\nSiegel (1905) described quite different organisms under the name\r\n_Cytorhyctes_. He listed several species: _C. vacciniæ_; of vaccinia\r\nand small-pox, _C. scarlatinæ_ of scarlet fever, _C. luis_ of syphilis\r\n(this is probably the granule stage of _Treponema pallidum_), and _C.\r\naphtharum_ of foot-and-mouth disease.\r\n\r\n(3) The afore-mentioned views were criticized, and the bodies were\r\nnot considered to be living organisms but merely reaction products or\r\ncell-inclusions due to the effects of the virus on the host cells.\r\nThus Guarnieri’s bodies were stated to consist of extruded nucleolar\r\nor plastin material, having no developmental cycle. It was further\r\nasserted that infection could be produced by lymph in which Guarnieri’s\r\nbodies had been destroyed. Similar assertions have been made regarding\r\nthe Negri bodies, and others. The _Cytoryctes_, _Neuroryctes_, etc.,\r\nare considered, according to these views, to be degeneration products\r\nof the nucleus or to be of a mucoid nature.\r\n\r\n(4) More recently a positive belief has gained ground that there\r\nare true parasitic organisms causing these diseases, and that the\r\nparasites are very minute, being termed Chlamydozoa by Prowazek and\r\nStrongyloplasmata by Lipschütz.\r\n\r\nThe Chlamydozoa are characterized by (_a_) their very minute size,\r\nsmaller than any bacteria, so that they can pass through bacterial\r\nfilters; (_b_) they pass through intracellular stages, in the cytoplasm\r\nor the nucleus of the host cell, producing therein the reaction\r\nproducts or inclusions in the cell already recorded as characteristic\r\nor diagnostic of the diseases produced; (_c_) they pass through\r\ndefinite developmental cycles. Such a cycle consists essentially of\r\ngrowth and division. The mode of division of the Chlamydozoa resembles\r\nthat of the centriole of a cell, by the formation of a dumb-bell-shaped\r\nfigure. Two dots are observed connected by a fine line or strand which\r\nbecomes drawn out and finally snaps across the middle. Prowazek and\r\nAragão (1909) working on smallpox in Rio de Janeiro found that the\r\nchlamydozoal granules passed through a Berkefeld filter and that the\r\nfiltrate was virulent. But if an “ultra-filter” were used, _i.e._, one\r\ncoated with agar, then the granules were retained and the filtrate\r\nwas no longer virulent. The surface of the ultra-filter was found to\r\ncontain many granules.\r\n\r\nThe Chlamydozoa are parasites of epiblastic tissues (_e.g._, epidermal\r\ncells, nerve cells, conjunctival cells).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 119.--Chlamydozoa. Trachoma bodies in infected\r\nepithelial cells of the conjunctiva. (_a_) initial bodies (above) and\r\ncluster of elementary bodies (touching the nucleus); (_b_) cluster\r\nof granules surrounded by mantles. × 2,000 approx. (Original. From\r\npreparation by Fantham.)]\r\n\r\nThe life-history of a Chlamydozoön (fig. 119), such as that of\r\nvaccinia, is, according to Prowazek, Hartmann and their school, as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n1. The infection begins with _elementary bodies_ or _elementary\r\ncorpuscles_ which live at first extracellularly. An elementary body\r\nis a minute speck of chromatin, apparently devoid of cytoplasm, which\r\ncan pass through a bacterial filter. It can enter a host cell, but the\r\nentry is not a process of phagocytosis.\r\n\r\n2. Inside the host cell the elementary body grows in size, and becomes\r\nan _initial body_ (fig. 119, _a_).\r\n\r\n3. A reaction on the part of the host cell results, for nucleolar,\r\nplastin substance is extruded from the cell-nucleus and surrounds the\r\nparasitic initial body. The latter is thus enveloped in a mantle (hence\r\nthe name Chlamydozoa, from χλαμὑς, a mantle), and the characteristic\r\ncell-inclusion (Guarnieri’s body, Negri’s body, etc.) is produced. The\r\nnucleolar, mantle substance probably represents the “cytoplasm” of\r\n_Cytoryctes_, described by Calkins.\r\n\r\n4. The body next breaks up into a number of smaller bodies known as\r\n_initial corpuscles_. These, in their turn, divide by simple division\r\n(in the manner already described) into numerous elementary bodies\r\n(fig. 119). Thus, the life-cycle is completed.\r\n\r\nThe Chlamydozoa are, then, the minute granules inside the body of the\r\n_Cytoryctes variolæ_ or the _Neuroryctes hydrophobiæ_, so that the\r\nwhole body of the _Cytoryctes_ or _Neuroryctes_ corresponds to the\r\nmantle and parasite of the Chlamydozoön. The Cytoryctes group is said\r\nto cause destruction of the host cell. The Cytoöikon group (_e.g._,\r\ntrachoma bodies) causes proliferation of the host cell.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1913, Noguchi[252] described the cultivation of the\r\nparasite of rabies in an artificial medium, similar to that used by\r\nhim for the cultivation of _Spirochæta recurrentis_. The cultures were\r\nstated to be infective to dogs, rabbits and guinea-pigs. Levaditi, in\r\nDecember, 1913, stated that he had succeeded in cultivating spinal\r\nganglia of rabid monkeys in monkey plasma.\r\n\r\n[252] _Journ. Exptl. Med._, xviii, p. 314.\r\n\r\nNoguchi and Cohen (November, 1913)[253] have succeeded in cultivating\r\nthe so-called trachoma bodies, or at any rate bodies very closely\r\nresembling them morphologically. The medium employed was Noguchi’s\r\nascitic fluid and rabbit kidney medium, as used for spirochætes. The\r\ncoarser cultural forms stained blue with Giemsa’s solution, the finer\r\nones stained red. Attempts to infect monkeys from the culture tubes\r\nfailed.\r\n\r\n[253] _Idem_, p. 572.\r\n\r\nFrom their behaviour on treatment with such reagents as saponin, bile\r\nand sodium taurocholate, Prowazek considers that the Chlamydozoa\r\napproach the Protozoa.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTOZOA INCERTÆ SEDIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Sergentella hominis*, Brumpt, 1910.\r\n\r\nEt. and Ed. Sergent in 1908 found vermiform bodies about 40 µ long by\r\n1 µ to 1·5 µ broad in the blood of an Algerian suffering from nausea\r\nand cold sweats, without other symptoms.

STEPHENS, M.D., B.C., D.P.H.\r\n\r\n\r\n  DEFINITION: Bilaterally symmetrical animals without limbs, the form\r\n  of which is leaf or tape-like, rarely cylindrical, and whose primary\r\n  body cavity (segmentation cavity) is absent, the cavity being filled\r\n  by a mesenchymatous tissue (parenchyma).\r\n\r\n  The mouth is either situated at the anterior end of the body, or is\r\n  shifted more or less backwards on to the flat ventral surface. The\r\n  alimentary canal consists of a short fore-gut, which is frequently\r\n  provided with a muscular pharynx, and of a simple forked or branched\r\n  mid-gut; there is neither a hind-gut nor an anus; in one class, the\r\n  Cestodes, the alimentary canal has entirely disappeared except for\r\n  muscular remnants in the scolex.\r\n\r\n  The INTEGUMENT OF THE BODY consists either of a ciliated epithelium\r\n  of only one layer (Turbellaria), or of a cuticle and gland-like\r\n  cells embedded in the parenchyma, or subcuticular layer (Cestodes,\r\n  Trematodes). The dermo-muscular layer consists of annular,\r\n  longitudinal, and even diagonal fibres, while the parenchyma is\r\n  traversed by dorso-ventral fibres.\r\n\r\n  The central NERVOUS SYSTEM, which is embedded in the parenchyma of\r\n  the body, consists of cerebral ganglia, united together in the shape\r\n  of dumb-bells, and of two or more longitudinal MEDULLARY FASCICLES,\r\n  often forming transverse anastomoses. Organs of sense usually occur\r\n  only in the free-living species, more rarely during the free-living\r\n  stages of a few parasitic species and in a few ectoparasitic forms.\r\n\r\n  [In Platyhelminthes simple eye-spots frequently occur, and in a few\r\n  an auditory vesicle.]\r\n\r\n  BLOOD-VESSELS and definite RESPIRATORY ORGANS are lacking [except\r\n  in _Nemertinea_]; the EXCRETORY APPARATUS (formerly termed\r\n  water-vascular system) is typical of the entire class. It commences\r\n  in the interstices of the parenchyma, with peculiar terminal cells\r\n  (ciliated funnels), which will be described later (p. 219), the\r\n  capillary processes of which go on uniting into larger branches,\r\n  and finally form two large collecting vessels, which, sometimes\r\n  separately and sometimes united, open to the exterior through one,\r\n  two, or numerous pores.\r\n\r\n  Nearly all the Platyhelminthes are HERMAPHRODITIC, and in nearly all\r\n  there are, in addition to the ovaries producing ova, other glands\r\n  attached to the female genital apparatus, namely, the vitellaria or\r\n  yolk glands, which provide a substance termed yolk, which serves\r\n  as nourishment for the embryo. The fully formed eggs have shells\r\n  and are “compound,” _i.e._, composed of the egg or ovarian cell,\r\n  which is surrounded by numerous yolk cells or their products of\r\n  disintegration. The two sexual openings usually lie close together,\r\n  frequently in the fundus of a genital atrium; they are rarely\r\n  separated from one another. Shell glands also usually occur (p. 221).\r\n\r\n  Reproduction is sexual, often, however, combined with asexual methods\r\n  of propagation (segmentation, budding). The Platyhelminthes live\r\n  partly free in fresh or salt water, exceptionally also on land. The\r\n  greater part, however, live as parasites on or in animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF THE PLATYHELMINTHES.\r\n\r\n  _Class I._--*Turbellaria* (or Eddy Worms). Flat worms for the most\r\n  part, free living, and always covered with a ciliated epithelium.\r\n\r\n    _Order 1._--_Rhabdocœlida_, gut unbranched.\r\n\r\n    _Order 2._--_Tricladida_, gut with three main branches.\r\n\r\n    _Order 3._--_Polycladida_, a central gut with lateral cæca.\r\n    Development direct or through metamorphosis. They live in fresh and\r\n    salt water or on land; very seldom as parasites.\r\n\r\n  _Class II._--*Trematoda* (Sucking Worms[254]). [Usually known as\r\n  Flukes.--F. V. T.] Flat worms, living as ecto- or endoparasites, that\r\n  are only ciliated in the larval condition, and in their adult state\r\n  are covered with a cuticle, the matrix cells of which lie in the\r\n  parenchyma. They have either one, a few, or several suckers,[255] and\r\n  frequently also possess chitinous fixation and adhesive organs. The\r\n  intestine is single, but generally bifurcated, and not uncommonly there\r\n  are transverse anastomoses between the forks or diverticula on them.\r\n  Excretory organs double, with two orifices at the anterior extremity\r\n  or a single one at the posterior end. Development takes place by a\r\n  metamorphosis or alternation of generations (p. 283). These worms are\r\n  almost always hermaphroditic, with two or more female and one male\r\n  sexual orifice. They live, almost without exception, as parasites on\r\n  vertebrate animals, but the intermediate generations are passed in\r\n  molluscs.\r\n\r\n[254] This grouping goes back to the year 1800, and was made by\r\nJ. G. H. Zeder, a physician and helminthologist of Forchheim, who\r\ndivided the helminths, which until 1851 were generally regarded as\r\na special class of animals, into the groups of round, hook, sucker,\r\ntape and bladder worms, as which they are recognized up to the present\r\ntime. In 1809, K. A. Rudolphi gave them the names _Nematodes_,\r\n_Acanthocephali_, _Trematodes_, _Cestodes_ and _Cystici_.\r\n\r\n[255] A sucker or acetabulum (little cup) is a round, cup-shaped\r\nmuscular organ, the muscles of which are _sharply defined_ from those\r\nof the body.\r\n\r\n  _Class III._--*Cestoda* (Tapeworms). Endoparasitic flat worms without\r\n  an alimentary canal. The larval stages are rarely ciliated, but are\r\n  usually provided with six spines; the adult worm is covered with a\r\n  cuticle, the matrix cells of which are embedded in the parenchyma. The\r\n  body consists of a single segment (Cestodaria) or a chain of segments,\r\n  in which case it consists of the scolex and the segments containing\r\n  the sexual organs (proglottides) (Cestodes s. str.). The scolex is\r\n  provided with various adhesive and fixation organs, and there are\r\n  calcareous corpuscles in the parenchyma. Excretory organs symmetrical,\r\n  opening at the posterior end. These worms are always hermaphroditic,\r\n  and then possess one or two female and one male sexual orifice. During\r\n  development a larval intermediate stage (“measle”) occurs and almost\r\n  always in a different host to that in which the adult sexual worm\r\n  lives. The adult stage is parasitic in vertebrate animals; but the\r\n  larval stage may occur in invertebrates.\r\n\r\n\r\nClass II. *TREMATODA*, Rud.\r\n\r\nThese worms are usually leaf- or tongue-shaped, but also barrel-shaped\r\nor conical; they vary from 0·1 mm. to almost 1 m.[256] in length; most\r\nof them, however, are small (5 mm. to 15 mm.). The surface on which\r\nthe orifice of the uterus and the male sexual opening are situated is\r\ntermed the ventral surface; the oral aperture, which also acts as anus,\r\nis always at the anterior end in the sub-order _Prostomata_ (p. 230),\r\nbut in the sub-order _Gasterostomata_ it is ventral.\r\n\r\n[256] _Nematobothrium filarina_, van Bened., on the branchial chamber\r\nof the Tunny.\r\n\r\nSuckers are always present and occur in varying numbers and positions\r\nat the anterior extremities as well as on the ventral surface, and\r\noccasionally on the lateral margin and on the dorsum; the beginning\r\nof the intestine (mouth) is always surrounded by a sucker in the\r\n_Prostomata_.\r\n\r\nIn or near the suckers there may be chitinous hooks, claws or claspers,\r\nor the surface of the body is more or less covered with spines, scales\r\nor prickles; in one genus (_Rhopalias_) there are projectile tentacles\r\nbeset with spines on the sides of the anterior part of the body.\r\n\r\nThe body of adult Trematodes is covered by a homogeneous layer of\r\nvarying thickness, which either lies directly over the external layer\r\n(basement membrane) of the parenchyma, or over the muscles embedded\r\nin the parenchyma. This investing membrane (cuticle) arises from\r\npear-shaped or spindle-shaped cells arranged singly or in groups (which\r\nlie between or internal to the diagonal muscles), and is connected with\r\nthem by processes; these cells one may regard as epithelial cells which\r\nhave sunk down, or possibly as parenchymatous cells. An epithelium of\r\none layer is also found on the body of young stages, but it disappears\r\nduring growth, and only occasionally do its nuclei persist until adult\r\nlife. In its place we then find the cuticle, which, moreover, extends\r\ninto all the body openings more or less deeply.\r\n\r\nIt is thus a debatable point whether the “investing layer” of flukes\r\nis a cuticle--that is, consists of modified epithelial cells--or\r\nwhether it is a basement membrane, _i.e._, compressed and modified\r\nconnective tissue cells; in this latter case the true epidermis and\r\ncuticle have been cast off. In the former case the epidermal cells are\r\nthe pear-shaped cells referred to above. According to recent authors\r\nit consists of two parts, an outer true cuticle and an inner basement\r\nmembrane. There are also unicellular cuticular glands, lying isolated\r\nor in groups, which are termed cephalic, abdominal, or dorsal glands\r\naccording to the position of their orifice.\r\n\r\nThe PARENCHYMA is a connective substance, the structure of which is\r\nstill a matter of dispute. It consists, according to some authors, of\r\nmultipolar cells, the offshoots from which anastomose with each other\r\nso that a network, permeating the entire body and encompassing all the\r\norgans, is produced. There exists also, as part of it, a homogeneous\r\nmatrix, in the form of lamellæ and trabeculæ that border small cavities\r\ncommunicating with each other and filled with fluid. According to\r\nother authors, the parenchyma of the Trematodes consisted originally\r\nof cells, of which, however, only the cell membranes remain, while\r\nthe protoplasm has been liquefied except for small residua around\r\nthe nucleus. Between these cells an intercellular mass has appeared.\r\nBy partial absorption of the walls, adjoining spaces unite, and the\r\noriginally flat cell walls become transformed into trabeculæ. According\r\nto this view the cavities filled with fluid are _intra_-cellular,\r\naccording to the former view _inter_-cellular. Pigment cells occur only\r\nin a few species.\r\n\r\nThe MUSCULAR SYSTEM of the Trematodes is composed of (1) a\r\ndermo-muscular tube, (2) the dorso-ventral or parenchymal muscles, (3)\r\nthe suckers, and (4) the special muscles of certain organs.\r\n\r\nThe dermo-muscular tube, which lies fairly close to the cuticle,\r\nconsists of annular, diagonal, and longitudinal fibres which surround\r\nthe entire body in one or several layers, and as a rule are more\r\nstrongly developed on the ventral surface as well as in the anterior\r\npart of the body. The MUSCLES OF THE PARENCHYMA are found chiefly in\r\nthe lateral parts of the body and pass through the parenchyma in a\r\ndorso-ventral direction; their diverging brush-like ends are inserted\r\non the inner surface of the cuticle (fig. 120).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 120.--Half of a transverse section through\r\n_Fasciola hepatica_, L. 25/1. _Cu._, Cuticle with scales; under the\r\ncuticle are circular muscles, and adjoining them the longitudinal\r\nand diagonal muscles; internal to the latter are the matrix cells of\r\nthe cuticle; _I._, gut; the other similarly contoured cavities are\r\ngut diverticula that have been transversely or obliquely sectioned;\r\n_F.v.s._, vitellaria; _Ex.v._, excretory vessels; _T._, testes; _Md._,\r\nmedian plane; the fibres passing from the ventral to the dorsal surface\r\nare the muscles of the parenchyma. The parenchyma itself is omitted.]\r\n\r\nThe suckers are specially differentiated parts of the dermo-muscular\r\ntube. Their concave inner surface is lined by the continuation of the\r\ncuticle and their convex external surface is covered by a more dense\r\ntissue that frequently takes the form of a refractive membrane, thus\r\nseparating them from the parenchymal muscles.\r\n\r\nThe principal mass of the suckers consists of muscular fibres which\r\nrun in three directions--equatorial, meridional and radial. The\r\nequatorial fibres correspond to the annular muscles, the meridional\r\nfibres to the longitudinal muscles, and the radial fibres to the\r\nmuscles of the parenchyma; the radial fibres are always the most\r\nstrongly developed. The function of these muscles is evident from\r\ntheir position; the meridional fibres flatten the suctorial disc and\r\ndiminish the depth of its cavity, so that the internal surface may\r\nadhere to the object to be held; if the equatorial fibres now contract,\r\nthe sucker rises by elongating longitudinally, and its inner surface\r\nis drawn in by the contraction of the radial muscles. Thus the sucking\r\ndisc becomes adherent. Usually also there is a sphincter at the border\r\nof the suckers, which plays its part during the act of adhesion by\r\nconstricting in a circular manner that part of the mucous membrane to\r\nwhich it is attached. The loosening of the fixed sucker is effected\r\nby relaxation chiefly of the radial fibres, by the contraction of the\r\nmeridional fibres and certain bundles of muscles situated at the base\r\nand at the periphery of the suckers. The connective and elastic tissues\r\nbetween the muscles of the suckers probably also take part in the\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 121.--_Harmostomum leptostomum_, Olss., an immature\r\nspecimen from _Helix hortensis_. _Nervous system_, according to\r\nBettendorf. _A.s._, ventral sucker; _C.g._, cerebral ganglion; _Ex.p._,\r\nexcretory pore; _G.p._, genital pore; _O.s._, oral sucker; _M.d._,\r\ndorsal medullary nerve; _M.l._, lateral medullary nerve; _N.ph._,\r\npharyngeal nerve; _M.v._, ventral medullary nerve. Magnified.]\r\n\r\nOf the muscles of the organs which have developed from the parenchyma\r\nmuscles we may briefly mention those bundles that are attached to\r\ncertain parts of the genital apparatus, to the suckers, to the hooks\r\nand claws, and also, at all events in _Fasciola hepatica_, to the\r\nspines. The sheaths used for the projection of the tentacles of the\r\n_Rhopaliadæ_ are also muscular.\r\n\r\nThe contractile elements consist of fibres of various lengths that are\r\nmostly parallel to one another, and frequently anastomose; a cortical\r\nsubstance finely fibrillated can usually be distinguished from an\r\ninternal homogeneous mass; large nucleated cells of uniform size are\r\nalways connected with them; these have been variously interpreted,\r\nbut have been proved to be myoblasts, one or more of their processes\r\nconstituting the muscular fibres.\r\n\r\nThe MOVEMENTS of the Trematodes consist in alterations of form and\r\nposition of the body, as well as in creeping movements.\r\n\r\nIn the NERVOUS SYSTEM (fig. 121) can be distinguished a cerebral\r\nportion as well as strands (medullary strands) running from it, and\r\nperipheral nerves. The cerebral portion always consists of two large\r\nganglia situated in the anterior end of the body which pass dorsally\r\nover the œsophagus and are connected by means of a broad and thick\r\ncommissure composed of fibres only. From each ganglion three nerves\r\nrun anteriorly--the inner and dorsal nerve for supplying the anterior\r\ndorsal part of the body; the median and ventral for the oral sucker;\r\nand the exterior and lateral likewise for the supply of the sucker.\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner three strands run backwards from each ganglion--one\r\ndorsal, one lateral and one ventral. The dorsal and ventral strands\r\nbecome united and curve backwards; the symmetrical lateral strands\r\nare connected by means of transverse commissures, the number of which\r\nvary according to the species. Such commissures also exist between the\r\nlateral and the two other strands on each side. There are ganglion\r\ncells along the entire course of the posterior cords, more particularly\r\nat the points of origin of the commissures. There also appears to be in\r\naddition a fourth anterior and posterior pair of nerves, the front pair\r\nfor the oral sucker and the hind pair for the pharynx.\r\n\r\nThe peripheral nerves, which spring from the posterior strands as well\r\nas from the commissures, either pass directly to the muscular fibres or\r\nto the sensory cells that are situated at the level of the subcuticular\r\ncells, or they reach these after the formation of a plexus situated\r\nimmediately beneath the dermo-muscular layer; the processes directed\r\noutwards terminate in small vesicles in the cuticle.\r\n\r\nAs to other ORGANS OF SENSE, simple eyes, two or four in number, are\r\nknown in several ectoparasitic species as well as in a few free-living\r\nlarval stages (Cercariæ) of endoparasitic forms. In the adult stage,\r\nhowever, they usually undergo complete atrophy.\r\n\r\nThe ALIMENTARY CANAL commences with an oral aperture, generally\r\nterminal or sub-terminal (ventral) at the anterior extremity, which\r\nleads into an oral cavity usually surrounded by a sucker; the\r\nœsophagus, of various lengths, is directed backwards and is generally\r\nsurrounded by a muscular pharynx (fig. 122). In some cases there exists\r\nbetween the sucker and pharynx, pharyngeal pouches (præpharynx). Sooner\r\nor later the intestine divides into two lateral branches directed\r\nbackwards, both of which end blindly (cæca) at the same level.[257]\r\nIn many ectoparasites (_Monogenea_ [p. 222]) a connection exists\r\nbetween the genital glands and one of the intestinal branches (ductus\r\nvitello-intestinalis [fig. 123]).\r\n\r\n[257] The following conditions represent deviations from this type: (1)\r\nIn _Gasterostomum_ the oral aperture is situated in the middle of the\r\nventral surface, and occasionally is even nearer to the posterior than\r\nto the anterior end. There is no proper oral sucker, but the pharynx is\r\nthus termed. (2) A few genera, such as _Gasterostomum_, _Aspidogaster_,\r\n_Diplozoon_, etc., have only _one_ intestinal diverticulum, which is\r\nundoubtedly to be taken as representing the primitive condition, as\r\nit is also often found in the young stages of the _Trematoda_. (3)\r\nThe branches of the intestines are curved and united behind (several\r\n_Tristomidæ_ and _Monostomidæ_), while in _Polystomum integerrimum_\r\n(in the bladder of frogs) there are several commissures between the\r\nintestinal branches, and in the _Schistosomidæ_ the united intestinal\r\nbranches proceed as one channel towards the posterior end. (4) The\r\ntermination of the two intestinal branches is not always on a level;\r\nthey are therefore of different lengths. (5) When the œsophagus is\r\nvery long the intestinal branches extend both forward and backward, so\r\nthat the gut exhibits the form of an *H*. (6) In the broad and flat\r\nspecies the gut-forks form diverticula mostly externally but also\r\ninternally; these again may branch (fig. 139). (7) In a few cases\r\n(_Nematobothrium_, _Didymozoon_) the intestine completely disappears up\r\nto the pharynx.\r\n\r\nThe oral cavity, pharyngeal pouches, pharynx, and œsophagus are\r\nlined with a continuation of the cuticle of the body; the gut cæca\r\nare lined with tall cylindrical epithelium (fig. 120). The œsophagus\r\nand intestinal branches often have also one layer of annular and\r\nlongitudinal muscles; the pharynx has essentially the structure of a\r\nsucker (fig. 122).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 122.--Median section through the anterior part of\r\n_Fasciola hepatica_: the oral sucker, pharyngeal pouches, pharynx,\r\nœsophagus, cuticle with spines, and the body parenchyma.]\r\n\r\nThe accessory organs of the alimentary canal consist of groups of\r\nunicellular SALIVARY GLANDS that discharge into the œsophagus in front\r\nof or behind the pharynx, or even into the pharynx itself.\r\n\r\nThe food of the Trematodes consists of mucus, epithelial cells, the\r\nintestinal contents of the hosts, and often also of blood, and this\r\nnot only in those species living in the vascular system, but also in\r\nspecies living as ectoparasites or in the intestine or biliary passages\r\nof their hosts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 123.--_Polystomum integerrimum_, a monogenetic\r\nfluke from the urinary bladder of the frog. _i._, intestine; _h._,\r\nlarge hooks of the sucking disc; _h.k._, smaller hooklets; _l.c.v._,\r\nlongitudinal vitelline ducts; _o._, oral orifice; _Oot._, oötype;\r\n_ov._, ovary; _s.p._, suckers of the disc; _tr.c.v._, transverse\r\nvitelline ducts; _Ut._, uterus with ova; _v._, entrance to the vagina;\r\n_v.d.e._, vas deferens; _v.d.i._, ductus vitello-intestinalis; the\r\nvitellaria and testes are not shown.

Of the other organs, the oral sucker, pharynx, genital pore,\r\nventral sucker, ovary and testes are shown; the cylindrical excretory\r\nbladder is in the posterior end. 38/1. (After Looss.)]\r\n\r\nThe final products of assimilation dissolved in the fluids of the body\r\nare distributed throughout the parenchyma and are thence expelled\r\nby a definite tubular system (excretory apparatus, proto-nephridia,\r\nformerly also termed the water-vascular system). This system, which is\r\ndistributed throughout the entire body (fig. 124), is symmetrically\r\ndeveloped, and, in the ectoparasitic Trematodes, it opens, right and\r\nleft, at the anterior end on the dorsal surface; in all other flukes,\r\nhowever, it opens singly into the excretory pore (foramen caudale) at\r\nthe centre of the posterior border; in those cases, however, where a\r\nsucker is present at the posterior end, as in the Amphistomata, the\r\nexcretory pore is situated on the dorsal surface close in front of the\r\nsucker.\r\n\r\nThe EXCRETORY SYSTEM[258] consists of several parts: (1) of the more or\r\nless numerous terminal “flame” cells or funnel cells (figs. 124, 125);\r\n(2) of the capillaries ending in them; (3) of larger vessels receiving\r\nthe capillaries; and (4) of the excretory bladder. Terminal cells and\r\ncapillaries may be compared to unicellular glands with long excretory\r\nducts; the cellular body (fig. 125) is comparatively large, stretched\r\nlongitudinally, more rarely transversely, and provided with numerous\r\nprocesses, that are lost in the parenchyma; within is a conical cavity\r\n(analogous to the secretory cavity of unicellular glands) which is\r\ncontinued directly into the structureless capillary; at its blind end\r\nis a bunch of cilia projecting into the cavity, and which, during life,\r\nshows a flickering motion (ciliary flame). The nucleus is situated in\r\nthe protoplasm of the terminal cell at its blind end.\r\n\r\n[258] The following description relates in the main to the _Distomata_.\r\n\r\nThe entire apparatus thus begins blindly--_i.e._, within the terminal\r\ncells, to which must be ascribed the capacity of taking up from the\r\nfluid that permeates the parenchyma the products which are first\r\ncollected into their own cavities and thence excreted by means of the\r\ncapillaries and vessels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 125.--Terminal flame cell of the excretory system.\r\n_n._, nucleus of cell; _c._, bundle of cilia forming the “flame”; _p._,\r\nprocesses of cell extending into parenchyma; _d._, excretory capillary.\r\n(Stephens.)]\r\n\r\nThe vessels possess definite walls, consisting of a membrane and a\r\nnucleated protoplasmic layer. They unite at many points on either side,\r\nand again pass into other canals (COLLECTING TUBES), which finally,\r\ntravelling towards the posterior end, discharge into the excretory\r\nbladder (fig. 124).\r\n\r\nThe form and size of the bladder vary much according to the different\r\nspecies, but it always possesses its own flattened epithelium,\r\nsurrounded by circular and longitudinal muscles, the circular muscles\r\nforming a sphincter around the opening. Frequently also the structure\r\nof the bladder extends to the tubules discharging into it, which\r\ntherefore are not to be regarded as separate “vessels,” but rather\r\nas tubular diverticula of the bladder, directed anteriorly. In some\r\nfew species the diverticula also branch and the branches anastomose,\r\nso that a network of tubules ensues which receives the vessels or\r\ncapillaries. In such cases there are also ciliary tracts in the tubules.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the entire apparatus usually consist of a clear or\r\nsometimes reddish fluid; in some species there are larger or smaller\r\ngranules, and occasionally also concretions occur.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 126.--Diagram of female genitalia. _Ov._, ovary;\r\n_ovd._, oviduct; _L.c._, Laurer’s canal; _Rec. sem._, receptaculum\r\nseminis; _Vit.

(Stephens.)]\r\n\r\n_Sexual Organs._--Nearly all the Trematodes are hermaphrodites,\r\nand only a few (_Schistosomidæ_, _Koellikeria_) are sexually\r\ndifferentiated. The sexual organs usually lie in the “central field”\r\nlimited by the gut cæca; the vitellaria, on the other hand, are, as a\r\nrule, external to the gut cæca in the “lateral fields.”\r\n\r\nThe male apparatus[259] is composed of two variously formed testes\r\n(fig. 127) (globular, oval, indented, lobed, or ramified), which may\r\nlie side by side or one behind the other; from each testicle a tube\r\n(vas efferens) originates; sooner or later, both tubes as a rule unite\r\nto form the ejaculatory duct or vas deferens, which is frequently\r\nenclosed in a muscular CIRRUS SAC, or more rarely passes directly into\r\nthe genital pore. The cirrus, which is the thick muscular terminal\r\nportion of the vas deferens, can be everted and protruded from the\r\ncirrus sac and serves as an organ of copulation. The walls of the\r\nmuscular portion of the tube (the cirrus) are attached to the walls of\r\nthe cirrus sac, and hence when the sac contracts the cirrus cannot be\r\nprotruded except by evagination of its lumen. Opening into the middle\r\nportion of the vas deferens, and as a rule enclosed in the cirrus\r\nsac, is found a mass of unicellular glands (prostate), the vesicula\r\nseminalis (which is likewise within, or may also be outside the sac)\r\nbeing the dilated first portion of the vas.\r\n\r\n[259] The following description relates mainly to the _Distomata_.\r\n\r\nThe female genitalia (fig. 126) consist of an ovary, usually situated\r\nin front of the testes, the form of which varies according to the\r\nspecies, the usually double vitellaria, the ducts and a number of\r\nauxiliary organs; the short oviduct directed towards the centre\r\narises from the ovary, and is connected in the median line with the\r\nexcretory duct of the vitelline glands. These grape-like glands possess\r\nlongitudinal excretory ducts, which assume a transverse direction\r\nbehind the ovary, unite together at the median line and form a single\r\nduct, often dilated into a vitelline receptacle, that unites with\r\nthe oviduct. Near this point, moreover, there frequently opens a\r\ncanal (Laurer’s canal) which begins on the dorsal surface, and on the\r\ninner end of which a vesicle filled with sperm (receptaculum seminis)\r\nusually occurs (fig. 126). Moreover, there are also numerous radial\r\nunicellular glands (shell glands) at or beyond the point of junction\r\nof the oviduct, vitelline ducts and Laurer’s canal. In this portion\r\nof the duct (oötype), which is usually dilated, the ovarian cells are\r\nfertilized, surrounded with yolk cells and shell material, and as\r\nova with shells they pass into the uterus (a direct continuation of\r\nthe oviduct), which, with its many convolutions, occupies a larger\r\nor smaller portion of the central field, and runs either direct to\r\nthe genital pore or, forming convolutions, first runs posteriorly and\r\nthen bends forward (descending and ascending limbs). In both cases\r\nthe terminal part lies beside the cirrus pouch and discharges beside\r\nthe male orifice either on the surface of the body or into a genital\r\natrium. The terminal portion of the uterus, which is often of a\r\nparticular structure, serves as a vagina (METRATERM).\r\n\r\nThe cirrus sac may include (1) the genital atrium (_i.e._, the common\r\nsinus, into which the vas deferens and vagina may open), or (2) a\r\nvariable extent of the vas from cirrus to seminal vesicle. Thus the\r\nlatter may be outside the sac. In the absence of a sac, the genital\r\nsinus may be surrounded by a pseudo-sucker, as in _Heterophyes_ (in\r\nsome cases the ventral sucker itself, from its close proximity to the\r\ngenital pore, serves as an accessory copulatory organ). In other cases\r\ncopulatory organs are formed by hooks projecting into the lumen of the\r\nterminal portion of the vas.\r\n\r\nThe GENITAL PORE, which is the opening from the genital sinus on to\r\nthe surface, is generally situated at or near to the median line on\r\nthe ventral surface and in the anterior region of the body; in most of\r\nthe _Distomata_ it is in front of the ventral sucker, in other cases,\r\n_e.g._, in the _Cryptocotylinæ_, it is behind.[260]\r\n\r\n[260] The typical position of the genitalia is subject to many\r\ndeviations, which are of importance in the differentiation of the\r\ngenera and families. The following are some few of these deviations:\r\n(1) The genital pore remains on the ventral surface, but is situated\r\nbeside or behind the ventral sucker, or it becomes marginal, and is\r\nthen found in front of or beside the oral sucker, or at a lateral edge,\r\nor, finally, in the centre of the posterior border; the ducts also\r\ncorrespondingly alter their direction. (2) The ovary usually lies in\r\nfront of the testes, not rarely, however, behind them or between them.\r\n(3) The three genital glands mostly lie together close in front of, or\r\nbehind, the centre of the body; they may be moved far back, and may\r\nincidentally become separated one from the other. (4) The vitellarium\r\nmay be single, in which case it then may lie in the central field.\r\n(5) A few forms possess but one, others several or numerous testes.\r\nAmongst the ectoparasitic trematodes there are also species with but\r\none testis; but they mostly have several. As a rule, their uterus is\r\nshort, but the oötype well developed. Special canals (vagina), single\r\nor double, are used for copulation, not the uterus. The vitelline\r\nducts also communicate with the intestine through the canalis\r\nvitello-intestinalis (fig. 123).\r\n\r\nThe spermatozoa do not differ essentially in their structure from those\r\nof other animals; the ovarian or egg cells are cells without integument\r\nand contain a large nucleus and a little protoplasm; the vitellaria\r\nalso produce nucleated cells, in the plasm of which there are numerous\r\nyellow yolk granules; the yolk cells detach themselves, like the\r\novarian cells, from the ovarium, and pass into the oviduct to surround\r\neach ovarian cell in the oötype. They disintegrate sooner or later in\r\nthe completely formed egg and are utilized as food by the developing\r\nembryo.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF THE TREMATODES.\r\n\r\n(1) _Copulation._--Observation has demonstrated that the one or\r\ntwo vaginæ occurring in the ectoparasitic Trematodes are utilized\r\nas female organs of copulation, and that the copulation is cross;\r\nit is also known that Laurer’s canal, which was formerly generally\r\nregarded as the vagina, has only quite exceptionally, if at all,\r\nserved the digenetic Trematodes as such--it appears to be homologous\r\nwith the canalis vitello-intestinalis of the _Monogenea_[261]--but\r\nthe terminal portion of the uterus, termed the metraterm, is used\r\nfor copulation. Cross-copulation occurs as well as auto-copulation\r\nand auto-fecundation. The spermatozoa subsequently pass through the\r\nentire uterus, which is still quite short at the time the male organs\r\nare matured; the maturation of which, as usually is the case in\r\nhermaphrodites, precedes that of the female organs. It is only later\r\nwith the onset of egg formation that the uterus is fully developed.\r\nCopulation, however, takes place also in the case of fully grown forms\r\nwith completely developed uteri.\r\n\r\n[261] _Monogenea_: Trematoda in which the anterior sucker, if present,\r\nis double. Development without an intermediate host.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 128.--Ovum of _Fasciola hepatica_, L., cut\r\nlongitudinally. The lid has been lifted in the process. Within the\r\negg are numerous yolk cells, and at the lid end there is the still\r\nunsegmented ovum (dark). 240/1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 129.--Miracidium of _Fasciola hepatica_ that\r\nhas just hatched from the egg, with a distinct cuticular ciliated\r\nepithelium. Magnified. (From Leuckart.)]\r\n\r\n(2) _Formation of the Ova._--The ovarian cells arising from the\r\novary first become mature after their entry into the oötype by the\r\nformation of three polar bodies, fertilization then taking place. At\r\nthe same time as the ovarian cell a number of yolk cells from the\r\nvitellarium and secretion, drop by drop, from the shell gland reach\r\nthe oötype.[262] The shell is then formed during the generally active\r\ncontractions of the oötype walls and then passes on into the uterus.\r\nIn the uterus of the endoparasitic trematodes the eggs accumulate more\r\nand more, often in large quantities, while in ectoparasitic species\r\ngenerally only one or some few eggs can be found. The completed ova\r\nare of various forms and sizes. They are mostly oval, at all events in\r\nthe digenetic trematodes, and the yellowish or brown shell is provided\r\nwith an opening at one pole which is closed by a watch-glass-shaped\r\nlid (operculum). Appendages (filaments) on the shell--at one or both\r\npoles--are uncommon, but are the rule in the ova of the _Monogenea_\r\n(ectoparasitic species).\r\n\r\n[262] [Recent work (_e.g._, Goldschmidt, _Zool. Anzeiger_, xxxiv,\r\np. 482) has shown that the older views regarding the formation of\r\nthe egg must be modified. In certain species, at any rate, the shell\r\nmaterial is formed by the yellow droplets of the yolk glands and not\r\nby the so-called shell gland (Mehli’s gland) secretion, which is clear\r\nand watery. The function of this secretion accordingly still requires\r\nexplanation; according to Looss it serves as a covering secretion for\r\nthe egg-shell proper. It appears also that other granules, the yolk\r\ngranules as distinct from the shell drop granules, are not always used\r\nup during the development of the embryo and hence do not function as\r\nyolk, so these also when they exist, and frequently they are wanting,\r\nmust serve some other purpose, possibly that of imbibing water for the\r\nuse of the embryo.--J. W. W. S.]\r\n\r\n(3) _Deposition of the Ova._--Soon after their formation, the\r\n_Monogenea_ (ectoparasitic trematodes) deposit round the place of\r\ntheir attachment on the skin or the gills or other organs of their\r\nhosts, eggs which attach themselves by means of their filaments. The\r\nembryonic development thus takes place outside the parent. This also\r\nholds good for the eggs of many endoparasitic species, although as a\r\nrule in these the eggs are always retained for a longer time in the\r\nuterus. Moreover, they usually here undergo a part or a whole of their\r\ndevelopment, and are eventually deposited in those organs in which the\r\nadult forms are parasitic, but this is not always the case, as the egg,\r\n_e.g._, of _F. hepatica_ appears in bile (and fæces) quite unchanged.\r\nBy the natural passages they eventually get out of the body, and in\r\ncases where such do not exist, as in the case of the blood-vessels, the\r\neggs pass out by means of the kidneys.\r\n\r\n(4) _The embryonic development_, after irregular segmentation of the\r\novum into a number of blastomeres, leads to the formation of a solid\r\nblastosphere or morula, which is surrounded by a cellular investing\r\nmembrane (yolk envelope), while the principal mass of the cells forms\r\nthe embryo, which uses for its nourishment the yolk cells, which have\r\nin the meantime disintegrated (_cf._ footnote, p. 223). Usually,\r\nafter the ova have reached water the embryos hatch out, leaving the\r\nyolk envelope in the egg-shell; in other cases, however, the embryos\r\nonly hatch out after having been subjected to the influence of the\r\nintestinal juices, that is to say, in the intestine of an intermediate\r\nhost which has ingested with its food the ova that have escaped from\r\nthe primary host.\r\n\r\n(5) _The post-embryonic development_ of the Trematodes is accomplished\r\nin various ways; the process is the most simple in the ectoparasitic\r\nspecies (_Monogenea_), the young of which should certainly be\r\nregarded as larvæ, because they possess characteristics (cilia,\r\nsimple gut, etc.) that are lacking in the adult worms, but which,\r\nnevertheless, pass into the adult state direct after a relatively\r\nsimple metamorphosis. In the _Holostomata_,[263] a group found chiefly\r\nin the intestine of aquatic birds, and which rarely occur in other\r\nvertebrates, the ova develop in water. The young are ciliated all over,\r\nand, after having entered an intermediate host (leeches, molluscs,\r\narthropods, amphibians, fishes) living in the water, they undergo a\r\nmetamorphosis into a second larval stage; they then encyst and await\r\ntransmission into the final host, where they become adult Metastatic\r\ntrematodes, _i.e._, trematodes without asexually produced generations\r\n(p. 229).\r\n\r\n[263] _Holostomata_: Prostomata with (in addition to the oral and\r\nventral suckers) a third fixation apparatus, generally on a separate\r\npart of the body.\r\n\r\nIn the remaining so-called digenetic trematodes (p. 230) one or two\r\nasexual generations interpose between the miracidium and terminal\r\nstage, so that quite a number of adult worms may originate from one\r\negg. Usually the young, which are termed MIRACIDIA[264] (fig. 129),\r\nhatch in water, where they move with the aid of their cilia. Sooner\r\nor later they penetrate into an intermediate host, which is always a\r\nsnail or a mussel, and while certain of their organs disappear, they\r\ngrow into a gutless germinal tube (SPOROCYST, fig. 131). These are\r\nsimple elongated sacs with a central body cavity. They may or may\r\nnot have excretory tubules. In these, according to the species, the\r\nlarval stages (CERCARIÆ) that will ultimately become adult worms are\r\nproduced, or another intermediate generation is first formed, _viz._,\r\nthat of the REDIÆ[265] (figs. 132, 133), which are always provided with\r\nan intestine, and these then give rise to cercariæ (figs. 130, 134).\r\nThe cercariæ, as a rule, leave their host and move about in the water\r\nwith the assistance of their rudder-like tails. After a little time,\r\nhowever, they usually again invade an aquatic animal (worms, molluscs,\r\narthropods, fishes, amphibians), then they lose their tails and become\r\nencysted (fig. 135); here they wait until they attain, together with\r\ntheir host, the suitable terminal host, and in this new situation they\r\nestablish themselves and reach maturity. Or, again, the cercariæ may\r\nthemselves encyst in water or on foreign bodies (plants) and wait until\r\nthey are taken up directly by the terminal host, _e.g._, sheep.\r\n\r\n[264] [Also known as ciliated embryos.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n[265] [In _Fasciola hepatica_ in the summer months the rediæ give rise\r\nto daughter rediæ, which then give rise to cercariæ.--J. W. W. S.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 130.--A group of cercariæ of Echinostoma sp. (from\r\nfresh water). 25/1.]\r\n\r\nAccordingly the following conditions are necessary for the completion\r\nof the entire development: (1) The terminal host in which the adult\r\nstage lives; (2) an intermediate host into which the miracidia\r\npenetrate and in which they become sporocysts; (3) a second\r\nintermediate host in which the cercariæ become encysted. In certain\r\nspecies, as in _Fasciola hepatica_, this second host is omitted, as the\r\ncercariæ spontaneously encyst on plants, or again (in other species)\r\nencystment may occur within the first intermediate host, when, in\r\nfact, the cercariæ (which in this case do not acquire an oar-like tail)\r\ndo not swarm out of, but encyst themselves within their sporocysts. The\r\ndevelopment, moreover, may be further complicated by rediæ appearing\r\nin addition to the sporocysts, though this occurs in the first\r\nintermediate host and not in a second one.\r\n\r\nAnimals that harbour adult digenetic Trematodes thus become infected by\r\ningesting encysted cercariæ, which either occur (1) in certain animals\r\n(second intermediate hosts) on which they feed, or (2) in water, or\r\n(3) on plants, or finally (4) in the first intermediate host; whereas\r\nanimals harbouring encysted cercariæ have been directly infected by\r\nthe corresponding tailed stage, and animals harbouring germinal tubes\r\n(sporocysts or rediæ) have been infected by the miracidia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 131.--Development of _Fasciola hepatica_, L. _a_,\r\nthe miracidium in optical section showing cephalic lobe, X-shaped\r\neye-spot resting on the cerebral ganglion, two germ balls; below each\r\nof these a flame cell, and still lower germ cells lying in a cavity\r\n(primitive body cavity). _b_, young sporocyst with two eye-spots, and\r\ngerm balls; the cells lining the cavity are not shown. _c_, older\r\nsporocyst with a young redia. Magnified. (After Leuckart.)]\r\n\r\nThus certain species of ducks and geese become infected with\r\n_Echinostoma echinatum_ by devouring certain water-snails (_Limnæus_,\r\n_Paludina_) in which the encysted cercariæ occur. Oxen become infected\r\nwith _Paramphistomum cervi_ (= _Amphistomum conicum_) by swallowing\r\nwith water, cysts of this species which occur at the bottom of puddles\r\nand pits. Sheep are infected with _Fasciola hepatica_ by eating grass\r\nto which the encysted cercariæ of the liver-fluke are attached;\r\nour song-birds infect themselves or their young with _Urogonimus\r\nmacrostomus_ by tearing off pieces containing the corresponding\r\nsporocysts which are full of encysted cercariæ from snails (_Succinea\r\namphibia_), which act as the first intermediate hosts, and eating, or\r\noffering their young these pieces.\r\n\r\n(1) The MIRACIDIA of the digenetic Trematodes are comparatively highly\r\norganized, and the mode of their formation from the segmentation cells\r\nof the ovum is only imperfectly known. They have a cuticular epithelium\r\n(fig. 129) entirely or partly covered with cilia, beneath this a\r\ndermo-muscular tube composed of circular and longitudinal muscles;\r\nalso, a simple gut sac with an œsophagus, occasionally also with\r\npharynx, salivary glands and boring spine, also a cerebral ganglion\r\non which, in some species, there are eyes (fig. 131, _a_). As to the\r\nexcretory organs, they are represented by two symmetrically placed\r\nterminal flame cells, with excretory vessels opening separately; there\r\nis a more or less ample (primary) body cavity between the parietes of\r\nthe body and the gut; from the cellular parietal lining of this cavity\r\nsingle cells (germ cells) become free (fig. 131, _a_, _b_), and become\r\nrediæ or cercariæ.\r\n\r\n[The germ cells of the miracidium and the germ balls of the\r\nsporocyst arise, according to some observers, by further division of\r\nundifferentiated blastomeres; according to others from the cells of the\r\nlining wall of its body cavity. It is from these free germ balls that\r\nthe redia stage is developed.\r\n\r\n[In the germ ball or morula appears an invagination, giving rise to\r\nthe cup-shaped gastrula stage. This elongates and forms the REDIA\r\n(fig. 131, _c_).\r\n\r\n[In the interior of the redia cells are budded off and develop into\r\ngastrulæ, as in the case of the sporocyst. These become a fresh\r\ngeneration of rediæ or give rise to the third stage (CERCARIA).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 132.--Young redia of _Fasciola hepatica_, with\r\npharynx and intestine, with a circular ridge anteriorly and a pair of\r\nprocesses posteriorly and masses of cells (germ balls) in the interior.\r\nMagnified.

The sporocysts when fully developed have the\r\nappearance of tubes or fusiform bodies with rounded edge; they are\r\nfrequently of a yellow colour. Their length rarely exceeds a few\r\nmillimetres; in some species their size increases exceedingly through\r\nproliferation, and they then occupy a large portion of the body of the\r\nintermediate host.\r\n\r\n(3) The REDIÆ (figs. 132, 133), on the other hand, are more cylindrical\r\nand always have a simple intestine of varying length, provided with\r\na pharynx; they likewise possess, situated near the circular ridge,\r\na “birth pore” which serves for the exit of the cercariæ originating\r\nwithin them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 134.--Cercaria of _Fasciola hepatica_; the\r\ncutaneous glands at the side of the anterior body.

(After Leuckart.)]\r\n\r\n(4) The CERCARIÆ[266] are very different; typically they consist of the\r\nanterior body and the oar-like tail at the posterior end (fig. 134).\r\nThe former, even to the genitalia, has the organization of the adult\r\ndigenetic Trematodes, and thus allows the easy recognition of at least\r\nthe characters of that large group to which the species in question\r\nbelongs. On the other hand, however, there are also organs that are\r\nlacking in the adult form, such as, in many, the boring spine in the\r\noral sucker, or the eyes situated on the cerebral ganglion; moreover,\r\nalso, cutaneous glands (fig. 134), the secretion of which forms the\r\ncyst membrane. The oar-like tail may be long or short (stumpy-tailed\r\ncercaria) or entirely absent; its free end may be partly split (furcate\r\ncercaria), or split to its base (_bucephalus_); in various forms also\r\nthe anterior end of the tail is hollow, and has enclosed within it the\r\nanterior body, which is otherwise free. The size also of the cercaria\r\nbelonging to the different species is very diverse; in addition\r\nto forms swimming in the water that have the appearance of minute\r\nmilky-white bodies, there are forms which measure as much as 6 mm. in\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n[266] The cercaria is the characteristic larval stage of the\r\nTrematodes, and corresponds to a cysticercus or cysticercoid, though\r\nthere is the important difference that the cercaria has an enteric\r\ncavity. According to some observers the enteron is represented by the\r\nfrontal sucker of some Cestodes, and by the rostellum of the majority\r\nof others.\r\n\r\nThe sporocyst and redia are regarded as intercalated stages, _viz._,\r\nas cercariæ exhibiting _pædogenesis_, _i.e._, development of young by\r\na parthenogenetic process from individuals (_i.e._, cercariæ) not yet\r\nadult.\r\n\r\nThe encysted cercariæ (fig. 135) are globular or oval, and are\r\nsurrounded by a homogeneous membrane, which may be striated or contain\r\ngranules. The tail is always cast off when encystment occurs, and\r\norgans peculiar to the cercaria stage (boring papilla, eyes) almost\r\nentirely disappear. On the other hand, the genitalia appear or become\r\nmore or less highly developed, in extreme cases to such an extent that\r\nthey become functional, and after autocopulation the creatures produce\r\nova within the cysts.\r\n\r\nThe cycle of development of the digenetic Trematodes has hitherto\r\nbeen generally explained as a typical ALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS, one\r\nsexual generation regularly alternating with one or two asexually\r\nreproducing generations. Recent authors, however, regard the cells\r\nin the sporocysts from which rediæ or eventually cercariæ arise as\r\nparthenogenetically developing ova, and the sporocysts as well as the\r\nrediæ as generations propagating parthenogenetically. In this case,\r\nhowever, it is an alternation of a sexual not with an asexual but with\r\nfirstly a parthenogenetic generation (the sporocyst), the central cells\r\nof which are regarded as ova which develop parthenogenetically into the\r\nredia, and this the second parthenogenetic generation finally produces\r\nlarvæ (cercariæ) capable of developing into the sexually mature form.\r\n\r\nOther authors, again, regard the development of the Digenea as only a\r\ncomplicated metamorphosis (p. 283), which is distributed over several\r\ngenerations before it is concluded.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIOLOGY.\r\n\r\nEndoparasitic Trematodes, as fully developed organisms, occur in\r\nvertebrate animals only, with very few exceptions; they inhabit almost\r\nall the organs (with the exception of the nervous and osseous systems\r\nand the male genitalia), but by preference the intestine in all its\r\nextent from the oral cavity to the anus; and, further, certain species\r\nor groups inhabit only quite restricted parts of the intestine.\r\nBesides in the intestine other species live in the liver, or in the\r\nbile-ducts, or in the gall-bladder; other accessory organs of the\r\nintestine, such as the pancreas, bursa Fabricii (of birds), are only\r\ninfected by a few species. Many inhabit the lungs, or the air sacs in\r\nfowls, a few the trachea. Trematodes have also been known to occur in\r\nthe urinary bladder, the urethra and the kidneys of all classes of\r\nvertebrates; they are also present in the vascular system of a few\r\ntortoises, birds and mammals; in birds they even penetrate from the\r\ncloaca into the oviducts, and are occasionally found enclosed in the\r\nlaid eggs; one species is known to occur in the cavum tympani and in\r\nthe Eustachian tube of a mammal (Dugong), another in the frontal sinus\r\nof the polecat; several species infest the conjunctival sac under the\r\nmembrana nictitans of birds, one species even lives in cysts in the\r\nskin of song-birds. In an analogous manner the ectoparasitic Trematodes\r\nare not entirely confined to the surface of the body or the trachea\r\nof the lower vertebrate animals; a few species appear exclusively in\r\nthe urinary bladder, in the œsophagus, and in the case of sharks in an\r\naccessory gland of the rectum.\r\n\r\nTrematodes live free and active within the organs attacked, though they\r\nmay attach themselves by suction for a longer or shorter period; in\r\nother cases, however, they bore more or less deeply into the intestinal\r\nwall with their anterior end, or lie in cysts of the intestinal wall\r\nwhich only communicate with the lumen through a small opening; in those\r\nspecies living in the lungs of mammals the host likewise produces a\r\ncyst, which usually encloses two specimens; such association of a pair\r\nis also observed in other situations, and, though this is the rule in\r\nspecies sexually distinct, it is not entirely confined to these.\r\n\r\nAs regards the AGE attained by endoparasitic Trematodes, there are but\r\nfew reliable records, and these differ considerably; the overwhelming\r\nmajority of species certainly live about a year, or perhaps a little\r\nlonger, but there are some whose term of life extends to several or\r\nmany years.\r\n\r\nTrematodes are but rarely found encysted in the higher vertebrate\r\nanimals; the condition, however, is more frequent in amphibians, and\r\nespecially in fishes, as well as in numerous invertebrate animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF THE TREMATODES OF MAN.\r\n\r\nThe following classification, partly artificial, partly natural,\r\nembraces only the flukes found in man:--\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder. *Digenea*, v.

The pharynx, which includes almost the\r\nentire œsophagus, measures 0·7 mm. in length and 0·4 mm. in breadth.\r\nThe intestine bifurcates at the limit of the cephalic cone and the\r\nbranches are even here furnished with diverticula directed outwardly.\r\nThe ovary is ramified and situated in front of the transverse vitelline\r\nduct, usually on the right side; the shell gland lies near the ovary\r\nin the median line; posterior to the transverse vitelline ducts are\r\nthe greatly ramified testes, which occupy the greater portion of the\r\nposterior part of the body, with the exception of the lateral and\r\nposterior border; the long vasa efferentia only unite as they enter the\r\ncirrus pouch. The vitellaria occupy the sides of the posterior part of\r\nthe body, commencing at the level of the ventral sucker and uniting\r\nbehind the testes. The ova are yellowish-brown, oval, operculated,\r\n130 µ to 145 µ in length, 70 µ to 90 µ in breadth (average size 132 µ\r\nby 70 µ).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 139.--_Fasciola hepatica_, L. From a specimen that\r\nis not yet mature, showing the gut and its branches. 5/1.]\r\n\r\nThe Liver Fluke inhabits the bile-ducts of numerous herbivorous mammals\r\n(sheep, ox, goat, horse, ass, rabbit,[268] guinea-pig, squirrel,\r\nbeaver, deer, roe, antelope, camel, kangaroo, and others), and is\r\ndistributed over the whole of Europe, though not to an equal extent. It\r\nis further known in North Africa, in North and South America, as well\r\nas in Australia; it is also found in Asia, as it has been reported from\r\nJapan, China, and Tonkin (Gaide, two cases in man). In some districts\r\nof Germany it is very frequent, and the slaughter-house statistics of\r\nvarious places show that it is of daily occurrence. _Fasciola magna_\r\noccurs in herbivora in America.\r\n\r\n[268] [There does not seem to be any direct evidence of either rabbits\r\nor hares normally being invaded by this fluke.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\nThe liver fluke, however, is by no means a harmless parasite, for it\r\nproduces in domestic animals, more especially in sheep, a disease of\r\nthe liver that appears epidemically in certain years and districts, and\r\ncommits great ravages amongst the flocks.\r\n\r\n[The following records show the enormous loss caused in sheep by this\r\nparasite. In 1812, in the Midi, principally in the Departments of\r\nthe Rhône, Herault, and Gard, the disease was rampant; 300,000 sheep\r\nperished in the Arles territory, and 90,000 in the Arrondissements of\r\nNîmes and Montpellier. In 1829 and 1830, in the Department of the\r\nMeuse and near localities, not only sheep but oxen died in enormous\r\nnumbers; for instance, in the Arrondissement of Verdun out of 50,000\r\nsheep 20,000 died, and out of 20,000 cattle 2,200 died. In England, in\r\n1830, 2,000,000 sheep were carried off; whilst in 1862 60 per cent.\r\nof the sheep died in Ireland; and in 1879 over 300,000 were lost in\r\nEngland; whilst as late as 1891 one owner in the same country lost over\r\n10,000 sheep (_Live Stock Journal_, October 30, 1891).--F.

(After Claus.)]\r\n\r\nThe disease usually commences towards the end of summer with an\r\nenlargement of the liver, induced by the invasion of numerous\r\nyoung flukes; in the autumn and winter the animals suffer from the\r\nconsequences of disordered biliary secretion; they become feverish,\r\nemaciated, and anæmic, and lose their appetite. In consequence of the\r\nconsecutive atrophy of the liver, œdema and ascites set in, and many\r\nanimals succumb to this “liver rot.” On examination the liver is found\r\nto be shrunken, the bile-ducts are enormously dilated and in parts\r\nsaccular and full of flukes. Should the animals survive this stage,\r\nspontaneous recovery ensues in consequence of the flukes commencing to\r\nleave the liver in the spring, but the liver remains changed and its\r\nsale is prohibited[269] when the changes are extensive.[270]\r\n\r\n[269] [This is not the case in Great Britain; fluky sheep are sent to\r\nmarket, there being no danger to man from eating the flesh.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n[270] As an example, this occurred in Berlin in the case of 19,034\r\noxen, 15,542 sheep, 1,704 pigs, and 160 calves in the period of\r\n1883–1893; during which time 719,157 oxen, 1,519,003 sheep, 2,258,110\r\npigs, and 567,964 calves were slaughtered. As a matter of fact,\r\nhowever, the number of infected beasts was really larger.\r\n\r\n[The following stages may be noticed in sheep suffering from\r\nfascioliasis. Gerlach recognized four stages, based on the varied\r\nrelations that the flukes contract with the liver of their host. These\r\nperiods are sometimes very marked, but at others, owing to subsequent\r\ninfections, the features become merged and so obliterated. But when a\r\nsingle infestation occurs they are very marked.\r\n\r\n[The first period is called the PERIOD OF IMMIGRATION. This occurs at\r\nthe fall of the year and generally passes unperceived, as the young\r\nflukes do little harm to the liver. It varies from four to thirteen\r\nweeks. Gerlach has remarked upon cases of death from apoplexy at this\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n[The second period is the PERIOD OF ANÆMIA. This occurs in November\r\nand December. The sheep at first fatten rapidly, but later the mucous\r\nmembranes become pale and of a yellowish hue, and the sheep become\r\nsluggish and cease to feed. The fæces are normal, but may contain fluke\r\nova.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 142.--_Fasciola hepatica_: egg from liver of sheep.\r\n_o_, operculum, _e_, segmenting ovum.

(From Leuckart.)]\r\n\r\n[The third period is the PERIOD OF WASTING. This corresponds with the\r\nbeginning of January--about three months after the entry of the larvæ.\r\nEmaciation now becomes very marked, the skin and mucous membranes\r\nblanched, temperature variable and marked by an irregular curve;\r\nrespiration laboured and quick; appetite regular; abortion frequently\r\noccurs in pregnant ewes; pressure on the back causes the animals to\r\nfall; local œdemas occur, the most perceptible in the submaxillary\r\nspace, extending below the larynx and over the cheeks and parotids\r\n(called “bourse,” “boule” in France; “watery poke” or “cockered” in\r\nEngland). Death usually occurs at this period, but a fourth stage may\r\noccur.\r\n\r\n[The fourth period is the PERIOD OF MIGRATION OF THE FLUKES. This\r\nis a period of convalescence and recovery, generally in May and\r\nJune.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\nOxen suffer less in general, but even in these animals “stray” hepatic\r\nflukes are occasionally found in the lungs, enclosed in thick-walled\r\ncysts.\r\n\r\n_Pathological Anatomy._--The bile-ducts are conspicuous on the surface\r\nof the liver. They are thickened and much dilated and in parts\r\nsaccular, and considerable atrophy of the liver cells accompanies\r\nthe condition. Histologically there is immense proliferation of the\r\nepithelium of the bile-ducts leading to “adenomata.”\r\n\r\nThe LIFE-HISTORY of the liver fluke was discovered by R. Leuckart and\r\nP. Thomas. According to these investigators the elongated miracidium\r\n(fig. 131, _a_) ciliated all over develops from the eggs a few weeks\r\nafter the latter (fig. 142) have reached the water, and after it has\r\nbecome free the embryo penetrates and becomes a sporocyst (fig. 131,\r\n_b_) in a water-snail (_Limnæus truncatulus_, Müll. = _L. minutus_,\r\nDrap.) that is common in fresh water, and can live in the smallest\r\ncollection of water as well as in fields that have been flooded. The\r\nsporocyst first of all produces rediæ, which remain in the same host\r\n(and under certain circumstances, _e.g._ in summer, these develop\r\na second generation of rediæ), and these finally form cercariæ\r\n(fig. 134). The latter become encysted on blades of grass and are taken\r\nup by the respective hosts with their food; this takes place towards\r\nthe end of summer, while the sheep feeding on the pasture land in the\r\nspring spread the eggs of the fluke, and sometimes the fluke itself, by\r\npassing them with their fæces.\r\n\r\nIn districts where _Limnæus truncatulus_ is absent, analogous species\r\nact as the intermediary hosts, of which one example according to Lutz\r\nis _Limnæus oahuensis_ in the Sandwich Islands.\r\n\r\n[The host in Europe is _Limnæus truncatulus_. This snail extends from\r\nSiberia to Sicily and Algeria, and according to Captain Hutton is a\r\nnative of Afghanistan. It also occurs in Thibet, Amoor, Morocco,\r\nTunis, Canary Islands and the Faroe Islands. It deposits its eggs or\r\nspawn upon the mud around ponds, ditches and streams. The eggs are laid\r\nin batches of thirty to a hundred, each snail laying as many as 1,500\r\neggs; they are united into strips of a gelatinous substance. In about\r\ntwo weeks young snails appear. It is amphibious, being more frequently\r\nmet with out of the water than in it. It occurs in elevated spots as\r\nwell as in low-lying districts. Moquin-Tandon found it at 4,000 feet\r\nin the Pyrenees. In the allied species, _L. peregra_, the fluke will\r\ndevelop up to a certain stage, but never completes all its varied\r\nphases.\r\n\r\n[In South America the host is probably _Limnæus viator_, Orb., and in\r\nNorth America _Limnæus humilis_, Say.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\nIn human beings as well as in some of the mammals quoted above, the\r\nliver fluke is only a casual parasite, and hitherto only twenty-eight\r\ncases have been observed in man; the infection was mostly a mild one\r\nand there were no symptoms, or only very trifling ones; a few isolated\r\ncases were only discovered _post mortem_. Occasionally, however, even\r\nwhen the infection was inconsiderable, severe symptoms were set up,\r\nwhich in isolated cases led to death. The symptoms (enlargement and\r\npainfulness of the liver, icterus) merely pointed to a disease of the\r\nliver.\r\n\r\n_Diagnosis_ can only be established by finding eggs in the fæces. Care\r\nshould be taken not to confuse them with those of _Dibothriocephalus\r\nlatus_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHALZOUN.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 144.--Young _Fasciola hepatica_, soon after\r\nentry into the liver. The intestinal cæca have lateral diverticula.\r\nMagnified. (From Leuckart.)]\r\n\r\nIn North Lebanon, the liver fluke is, according to A. Khouri, a\r\nfrequent parasite of man, not in the liver, however, but in the\r\npharynx. The occurrence in this unusual site is effected by the eating\r\nof raw infected livers, especially those of goats (_Capra hircus_). The\r\nflukes thus taken in do not all reach the stomach, where they would\r\nbe soon killed, but some of them attach themselves to the pharyngeal\r\nmucosa and to the adjoining parts, and there cause inflammation and\r\nswelling, which lead to dyspnœa, dysphagia, dysphonia and congestion of\r\nthe head, sometimes even to still more severe symptoms, and even death.\r\nThe affection termed “Halzoun” lasts some hours or several days, and\r\nafter vomiting recovery sets in. In other cases man becomes infected in\r\nthe usual way by ingesting cysts attached to grass or the underside of\r\nleaves of plants (_e.g._, Rumex sp.), where they are overlooked from\r\ntheir scanty size (0·2 to 0·3 mm.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 145.--_Fasciola gigantica._ × 6-1/2 (After Looss.)]\r\n\r\nAs the liver fluke feeds on blood it is possible that it also reaches,\r\nparticularly when young, the circulatory system, and cases have been\r\nknown in which it has been carried by the blood into organs far\r\nfrom its original situation. Such cases also have been repeatedly\r\nobserved in men. Probably the parasite described by Treutler, 1793, as\r\n_Hexathyridium venarum_, which protruded from the ruptured anterior\r\ntibial vein of a man, was a young liver fluke. A few adult specimens\r\nwere found by Duval in the portal and other veins _post mortem_ at\r\nRennes (1842) in a man, aged 49, and a similar statement is reported\r\nby Vital from Constantine (1874). Giesker, in 1850, found two hepatic\r\nflukes in a swelling on the sole of the foot of a woman. Penn Harris\r\nstates that he observed six specimens in Liverpool in a spontaneously\r\nruptured abscess of the occiput of a two months old infant. Another\r\ncase which, like the previous one, is reported by Lankester,[271]\r\nrelates to a sailor who suffered from an abscess behind the ear, and\r\nfrom which a liver fluke was expelled. Finally, Dionis de Carrières\r\nreports the case of a man, aged 35, in whose right hypochondriac region\r\na tumour the size of a pigeon’s egg had formed, and from which a young\r\nliver fluke was extracted.\r\n\r\n[271] In the English translation of Küchenmeister’s work on\r\nParasitology (London, 1857). The specimen is preserved in the Hunterian\r\nMuseum, London, and is an adult liver fluke, measuring 18 mm. in length\r\nand 7 mm. in breadth.\r\n\r\nFrom such records it is not impossible that _Distomum oculi humani_,\r\nAmmon, 1833, as well as _Monostomum lentis_, v. Nordm., 1832, may\r\nhave been very young hepatic flukes that had strayed. Ammon found\r\nfour specimens (length 0·5 to 1 mm.) of his species (named _Distomum\r\nophthalmobium_ by Diesing in 1850) between the opaque lens and the\r\ncapsule of a five months old child in Dresden, and von Nordmann\r\ndiscovered his _Monostomum lentis_ to the number of eight specimens\r\n(only 0·3 mm. in length) in the opaque lens of an old woman. Minute\r\nwhite bodies which Greef found in the cortex of the lens of a\r\nfisherman, aged 55, removed on account of cataract, were with some\r\nreserve regarded as Trematode larvæ. The fact that Ammon found that\r\nthe intestinal cæca of the worm discovered by him had no lateral\r\nbranches does not negative the above opinion, as in the liver fluke\r\nthe intestinal cæca are originally unbranched, and according to Lutz\r\nthey only develop lateral ramifications later, between the twelfth and\r\ntwenty-second day of infection (fig. 144).\r\n\r\n\r\n*Fasciola gigantica*, Cobbold, 1856.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Distomum giganteum_, Diesing, 1858; _Fasciola gigantea_,\r\n  Cobbold, 1858; _Cladocœlium giganteum_, Stoss., 1892; _Fasciola\r\n  hepatica_ var. _angusta_, Raill., 1895; _Fasciola hepatica_ var.\r\n  _ægyptiaca_, Looss, 1896.\r\n\r\nThis species is closely allied to _Fasciola hepatica_, but is\r\ndistinguished by its elongated body, short cephalic cone, almost\r\nparallel sides, larger ventral sucker, which is also closer to the oral\r\nsucker, and by its larger eggs.

The lungs were normal except for a sharply\r\ncircumscribed spot at the base of the left lung. Twenty days later\r\nduring a fit of coughing the patient spat up a fluke 25 mm. long,\r\ncharacterized by its slender aspect and by the size of its ventral\r\nsucker, and its close proximity to the oral sucker. Considering the\r\nfact that Gouvea’s patient had spent many weeks in July of the same\r\nyear in Dakar (Senegambia), where according to Railliet _Fasciola\r\ngigantica_ is common in slaughtered animals, and considering also the\r\ncharacters of the fluke, Railliet rightly assumes that one had to do\r\nwith the African giant fluke and that the patient had infected himself\r\nin Dakar.\r\n\r\n\r\nSub-family. *Fasciolopsinæ*, Odhner, 1910.\r\n\r\nGenus. *Fasciolopsis*, Looss, 1898.\r\n\r\n  Ventral sucker large, and elongated posteriorly into a sac.

Covered all over with spear-shaped\r\n  spines _arranged in groups_. Gut cæca winding with dilatations\r\n  or constrictions in parts. Ventral sucker in or in front of the\r\n  middle of the body. Excretory bladder cylindrical, very long and\r\n  broad, reaching in front to the bifurcation of the gut. The lateral\r\n  excretory canals join the bladder only a little in front of the\r\n  excretory pore. Genital pore median just behind the ventral sucker.\r\n  Genital sinus duct-like. Cirrus sac absent. Male terminal organs very\r\n  small. Ejaculatory duct present. Testes and ovary deeply lobed, the\r\n  testes in or just behind the middle, the ovary somewhat laterally\r\n  placed just _behind_ the ventral sucker. Uterus forms a coil behind\r\n  the ventral sucker. Eggs rather large, thin shelled, the ovarian cell\r\n  still unsegmented on deposition. Receptaculum seminis, small.\r\n\r\n  Parasitic in the lungs of mammals, enclosed in cyst-like cavities,\r\n  generally in pairs.\r\n\r\n  _Type Species._--_P. westermanii_ in the tiger.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Paragonimus ringeri*, Cobb., 1880.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Distoma ringeri_, Cobb., 1880; _Distoma pulmonale_, Baelz,\r\n  1883; _Distoma pulmonis_, Suga, 1883.\r\n\r\nThe body is of a faint reddish-brown colour and plump oval shape. The\r\nventral surface a little flattened; 7·5 to 12 mm. in length, 4 to 6 mm.\r\nin breadth, and 3·5 to 5 mm. thick (in man). The oral sucker (0·75 mm.)\r\nis subterminal; the ventral sucker (0·8 mm.) somewhat in front of the\r\nmiddle of the body. Pharynx spherical, 0·3 mm. in diameter, or 0·4 by\r\n0·3 mm.; œsophagus, 0·02 mm.; intestinal cæca convoluted, asymmetrical,\r\nthe first part having the same structure as the œsophagus. The cuticle\r\nis covered with spines in groups; the excretory pore opens at the\r\nposterior end rather on the ventral surface, the excretory ducts open\r\ninto the elongated bladder at the hind end near the pore. Genital pore\r\nbehind the ventral sucker and median. Genital sinus 0·2 mm. long with\r\nthick wall, ejaculatory duct 0·13 mm., pars prostatica 0·2 mm., seminal\r\nvesicle duct-like of irregular outline. Behind the sucker the ovary\r\non the left, and the closely packed uterine coil on the right (though\r\namphitypy of these two organs is common); the two irregularly lobed\r\ntestes lie side by side posteriorly. Vitellaria extensive, leaving only\r\na median dorsal and ventral space free. Seminal receptacle probably\r\nabsent; Laurer’s canal present. The eggs are oval, brownish-yellow,\r\nfairly thin shelled, and measure on an average 81·2 µ by 49·2 µ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 149.--_Paragonimus ringeri_, Cobb.: to the right,\r\ndorsal aspect; to the left, ventral aspect.

(After Leuckart.)]\r\n\r\nThe following species are also known:--_P. westermanii_, Kerb., 1878,\r\nin the tiger, and _P. kellicotti_, Ward, 1908, in the pig, dog, and\r\ncat (N. America). Ward and Hirsch give the following differences\r\nbetween the spines of the three forms:--\r\n\r\n                 _P. ringeri._      _P. westermanii._  _P. kellicotti._\r\n  Shape         Chisel-shaped,       Lancet-shaped,     Chisel-shaped,\r\n                  moderately heavy.    very slender.      heavy.\r\n  Distribution  Circular rows, in    Circular rows,     Circular rows,\r\n                  groups.              in groups.         singly.\r\n\r\nTwo other species, _P. rudis_, Diesing, 1850, in a Brazilian otter\r\n(_Lutra brasiliensis_) and _P. compactus_, Cobbold, 1859, in the Indian\r\nichneumon, are but little known.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Lungs, pleuræ, and especially the bronchi of man and\r\ndog. The alleged occurrence (of eggs) in other organs may be due to\r\nconfusion with those of _Schistosoma japonicum_.\r\n\r\n_Distribution._--China, Korea, and especially in Japan, where,\r\naccording to Katsurada, there are no districts that are entirely\r\nfree from pulmonary flukes. The _mountainous_ provinces of Okayama,\r\nKumamoto, Nagano and Tokushima are the principal centres.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 151.--Egg of _Paragonimus ringeri_, Cobb., from\r\nthe sputum. Showing the ovarian cell and vitelline cells and granules.\r\n1,000/1. (After Katsurada.)]\r\n\r\n_Pathology._--The number present in the lung varies from two to twenty,\r\nabout. Usually one cyst contains one worm, but in the dog each cyst\r\ncontains two. The cysts admit the tip of the finger, and have a fibrous\r\nwall 1 mm. thick. They originate partly from dilatation of bronchi and\r\nbronchioles. Others arise from the inflammatory reaction of lung tissue\r\ninto which the worms have wandered. The worms and their eggs cause\r\nbronchitis and peribronchitis, catarrhal, hæmorrhagic, or purulent,\r\nand areas of consolidation. Areas containing eggs in their centre\r\nresembling tubercle nodules are not uncommon, and extensive cirrhosis\r\nof the lung may be found. As a result of these changes, emphysema and\r\nbronchiectasis also occur.\r\n\r\nAs to the development, only the following details are known: that the\r\neggs, which before segmentation of the ovum reach the open in the\r\nsputum and through being swallowed also in the fæces, develop in water\r\ninto a miracidium ciliated all over, which hatches and swims about\r\nfreely. According to Manson this takes place in four to six weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nSub-family. *Opisthorchiinæ*, Looss, 1899.\r\n\r\nGenus. *Opisthorchis*, R. Blanch., 1845.\r\n\r\n  Opisthorchiinæ with lobed testes. Laurer’s canal present. Parasitic\r\n  in the bile-ducts of mammals and birds.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Opisthorchis felineus*, Riv., 1885.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Distoma conus_, Gurlt, 1831 (_nec_ Creplin, 1825); _Distoma\r\n  lanceolatum_, v. Sieb., 1836, v. Tright, 1889 (_nec_ Mehlis, 1825 =\r\n  _Fasciolo lanceolata_, Rud., 1803); _Distoma sibiricum_, Winogr.,\r\n  1892; _Distoma tenuicolle_, Mühl., 1896.\r\n\r\nThis parasite is yellowish-red in the fresh condition, and almost\r\ntransparent. The body is flat, with a conical neck at the level of the\r\nventral sucker marked by a shallow constriction; this, however, is only\r\nnoticeable in fresh and somewhat contracted specimens. Posteriorly\r\nto the ventral sucker the lateral borders run fairly parallel; the\r\nposterior end is either pointed or rounded off. The length and breadth\r\nvary according to the contraction, being usually 8 to 11 mm. by 1·5\r\nto 2 mm. The suckers are about one-fifth to one-sixth of the length\r\nof the body distant from each other, and of about equal size (0·23 to\r\n0·25 mm.). The œsophagus is hardly any longer than the pharynx, which\r\nlies close behind the oral sucker; the intestinal cæca reach almost to\r\nthe posterior border and are often filled with blood. The excretory\r\npore is at the posterior extremity, and the excretory bladder forks in\r\nfront of the anterior testis. The testes in the posterior fourth of\r\nthe body lie obliquely one behind the other; the anterior one has four\r\nlobes, the posterior one five lobes; the ovary is in the median line\r\ntransversely, simple or slightly lobed; behind it lies the large pear-\r\nor retort-shaped receptaculum seminis and Laurer’s canal. The uterus\r\nis in the median field. The vitellaria occupy the fairly broad lateral\r\nareas, in about the central third of the body, beginning behind the\r\nventral sucker and terminating at about the level of the ovary; the\r\nacini are small and arranged in groups of seven to eight, separated by\r\ninterstices. The genital pore is close in front of the ventral sucker.\r\nThe eggs are oval with sharply defined operculum at the pointed pole,\r\n30 µ, by 11 µ.\r\n\r\n  This species, which is frequently confused with others, inhabits\r\n  the gall-bladder and bile-ducts of the domestic cat especially;\r\n  but is also found in the dog, in the fox, and in the glutton\r\n  (_Gulo borealis_). It has been observed in France, Holland, North\r\n  Germany (being particularly frequent in East Prussia), in Russia,\r\n  Scandinavia, Siberia, Japan, Tonkin, Hungary, and Italy. The North\r\n  American form (from cats and _Canis latrans_) is a distinct species\r\n  (_Opisthorchis pseudofelineus_).\r\n\r\nIn man this species was first found by Winogradoff in Tomsk (nine\r\ncases), then by Kholodkowsky in a peasant from the neighbourhood of\r\nPetrograd who had travelled a great deal in Siberia, and finally by\r\nAskanazy in five persons who were natives of the East Prussian district\r\nof Heydekrug. In Tomsk, _Opisthorchis felineus_ is the most frequent\r\nparasite of man that comes under observation at _post mortem_ (6·45\r\nper cent.), whereas _Tænia saginata_ has only been found in 3·2 per\r\ncent., Echinococcus in 2·4 per cent., _Ascaris lumbricoides_ in 1·6 per\r\ncent., and _Oxyuris vermicularis_ in 0·8 per cent. of the autopsies.\r\nIn the district of Heydekrug, however, the species in question is also\r\nfrequent, as in a few years five cases came to our knowledge (of which\r\nthree were diagnosed by the discovery of the eggs in the fæces).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 152.--Egg of _Opisthorchis felineus_, Riv. 830/1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 153.--_Opisthorchis felineus_: from the cat. _m._,\r\nmouth; _p.b._, pharynx; _i._, gut; _g.p._, genital pore; _ac._, ventral\r\nsucker; _ut._, uterus; _v.g._, vitellarium; _ov._, ovary; _s.g._, shell\r\ngland; _r.s._, receptaculum seminis; _t._ testes; _ex. p._, excretory\r\npore. (After Stiles and Hassall.)]\r\n\r\nIn none of Winogradoff’s nine cases had the death of the patient been\r\ncaused direct by the parasites, yet more or less extensive changes\r\nin the liver were found in all of them; such as dilatation of the\r\nbile-ducts with inflammation and thickening of their walls, and foci\r\nof inflammation or atrophy in the liver substance; icterus was present\r\nfive times and atrophy of the liver an equal number of times; ascites\r\nwas observed three times, and in two cases, probably of recent date,\r\nthe organ was enlarged. The number of parasites found fluctuated\r\nbetween a few and several hundreds.\r\n\r\nIn two of Askanazy’s cases, which he examined more closely, carcinoma\r\nwhich had developed at the places most invaded by flukes was found\r\nat the _post-mortem_, so that perhaps there may be grounds for the\r\nconnection which the author seeks to establish between cancer of the\r\nliver and the changes induced by the parasites; these changes consist\r\nof numerous and even ramified proliferations of the epithelium\r\nof the biliary duct into the connective tissue, which is likewise\r\nproliferated. The number of worms found in one case amounted to over\r\n100; in a second case, in which the parasites had also invaded the\r\npancreatic duct, their number was even larger.\r\n\r\nWinogradoff as well as Askanazy found isolated flukes in the intestine\r\nalso.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 154.--_Opisthorchis pseudofelineus_: from the\r\nbile-duct of the cat (Iowa), _m._, oral sucker; _p.b._, pharyngeal\r\nbulb; _es._, œsophagus; _i._, intestine; _va._, vagina; _g.p.m._, male\r\norifice; _ac._, ventral sucker; _ut._, uterus; _v.g._ vitellarium;\r\n_s.g._, shell gland; _v.dt._, vitelline duct; _ov._, ovary; _r.s._,\r\nreceptaculum seminis; _L.c._, Laurer’s canal; _t._, testis; _ex.c._,\r\nexcretory bladder; _ex.p._, excretory pore. (After Stiles.)]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, nothing much is known of the history of the development\r\nof _Opisthorchis felineus_; we only know that when deposited the eggs\r\nalready contain a ciliated miracidium, which, however, according to my\r\nexperience, does not hatch out in water, but only after the entry of\r\nthe eggs into the intestine of young _Limnæus stagnalis_; no further\r\ndevelopment, however, occurs. Winogradoff states that he has seen the\r\nmiracidia hatch after the eggs had been kept in water for a month at\r\n37° C.; and has even observed free miracidia in the bile of man and of\r\na dog respectively. Although the whole post-embryonal development of\r\nthe cat fluke remains yet to be investigated, Askanazy by a series of\r\nexperiments on cats and dogs has discovered the mode of infection. The\r\nintermediate hosts are fish, and mainly the ide, in this country called\r\nTapar (_Idus melanotus_, H. and Kr.), and of subsidiary importance the\r\nroach (_Leuciscus rutilus_). Both species of fish as well as others\r\nare readily eaten raw by man on the Courland lagoon (Baltic). It is,\r\nmoreover, significant that those persons whom Askanazy found infected\r\nwith the cat fluke were also infected with _Dibothriocephalus latus_,\r\nthe intermediate host of which is also fish (Lota sp., Esox sp., Perca\r\nsp.).\r\n\r\nIn one of his nine cases Winogradoff also saw a small fluke covered\r\nall over with spines, which he conjectured to be the young stage of\r\n_Opisthorchis felineus_; as, however, according to my experience, this\r\nspecies, even in smaller specimens, is always without spines, the above\r\nhypothesis cannot be accepted. It is much more probable that one of\r\nthe other species that also invade the liver of cats may accidentally\r\nbe introduced into man; we know, in fact, that _Metorchis albidus_,\r\nBraun, and _Metorchis truncatus_, Rud., are both covered with spines.\r\nAs, however, the spines of the first-named species are rather apt to\r\nfall off, and also as it possesses a different shape (spatula-shaped),\r\nit may be assumed that probably Winogradoff had found _Metorchis\r\ntruncatus_, Rud., 1819, in his patient.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Paropisthorchis*, Stephens, 1912.\r\n\r\n  Structure as in Opisthorchis, except that the ventral sucker and\r\n  genital pore occur on the apex of a process or pedicle projecting\r\n  from the anterior portion of the body. This process is about 1/2 mm.\r\n  long, and is retractile.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Paropisthorchis caninus*, Barker, 1912.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Distoma conjunctum_, Lewis and Cunningham, 1872; _Opisthorchis\r\n  noverca_, M. Braun, 1903 (_pro parte_); _Opisthorchis caninus_,\r\n  Barker, 1912 (?).\r\n\r\nLength varies from 2·75 to 5·75 mm. in preserved specimens, average\r\n3·6 to 5·2 mm. Body uniformly spinose, though as a rule spines are not\r\npresent on the pedicle. Body slightly concavo-convex, the concavity\r\nbeing ventral. Oral sucker 0·28 mm. Pharynx 0·224 by 0·184 mm.\r\nŒsophagus 0·04 mm. Ventral sucker 0·176 mm. in diameter. Pedicle about\r\n1/2 mm. long, may be completely retracted.\r\n\r\n_Genital Pore_--opens on the apex of the pedicle in front of the\r\nventral sucker. Its exact position varies with the state of contraction\r\nof the parts. In certain cases it actually opens within the cuticular\r\nborder of the sucker, in other cases it opens externally to the sucker\r\nand anterior to it. The opening is covered with scales. The vas\r\ndeferens and uterus run alongside one another until they merge near the\r\napex of the pedicle into a common sinus.\r\n\r\n_Vitellaria_--consist of eight acini on each side, extending from\r\nslightly behind the base of the pedicle to the anterior border of the\r\novary, or as far back as a line separating the posterior border of the\r\novary from the anterior border of the anterior testis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 155.--_Paropisthorchis caninus_: from the\r\nbile-ducts of the pariah dog, India. _Acet. v._, ventral sucker; _Ut._,\r\nuterus; _V. ex. lat_., longitudinal excretory duct; _V. sem._, seminal\r\nvesicle; _Sem. rec._, seminal receptacle; _Ov._, ovary; _V. ex._,\r\nexcretory bladder; _Test. l._, left testis; _Test. r._, right testis;\r\n_P. ex._, excretory pore. × 40.

The\r\nanterior testis is usually on the left side.\r\n\r\n_Ovary_--multilobular, the lobes 6 to 8 being irregular in size and\r\nshape.\r\n\r\n_Shell Gland_--extensive and diffuse, occupying an area which\r\napproximately corresponds with the loop of the transverse vitelline\r\nducts.\r\n\r\n_Seminal Receptacle_--globular, to the right of and dorsal to the\r\nposterior lobe of the ovary.\r\n\r\n_Laurer’s Canal_--generally runs from the end of the receptacle with a\r\nsingle curve medially and backwards.\r\n\r\n_Uterine Coils_--form loosely packed transverse coils terminating\r\nslightly in front of the level of the first vitelline acini. From here\r\nthe uterus passes forwards into the pedicle to the left and ventral to\r\nthe seminal vesicle.\r\n\r\n_Seminal Vesicle_--commences about the level of the first vitelline\r\nacini. The coils displace the uterus ventrally and to the left. In\r\nthe pedicle the vesicle diminishes in extent and lies in its dorsal\r\n(anterior) side.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Liver of pariah dogs, India.

The knobs on\r\nthe eggs are not shown. × 900. (After Looss.)]\r\n\r\nVerdun and Bruyant deny, in opposition to Looss, the possibility of\r\nbeing able to distinguish within the genus Clonorchis the two species\r\ndescribed, but they admit the justification for the new genus. They\r\nalso report the occurrence of _Opisthorchis felineus_ in man in Tonkin\r\n(_Compt. Rend. Soc. de Biol._, lxii, 1907).\r\n\r\n_Pathology._--Both species of Clonorchis give rise to grave symptoms.\r\nThe liver is generally enlarged, though when the infection has\r\nlasted some time it begins to contract. The surface of the organ\r\nis studded with white vesicles, and on cutting into it one sees\r\nnumerous cavities with thickened walls (distended bile-ducts) filled\r\nwith a brownish fluid containing innumerable eggs, which cause its\r\ncolour. Microscopically, the epithelium of the bile-ducts is either\r\n(1) entirely destroyed, or (2) actively proliferates, forming an\r\nadenomatous outgrowth. Occasionally this proliferation is not limited\r\nby the wall of the bile-duct but penetrates it and leads to a growth\r\nof numerous new ducts, forming a malignant biliary adenoma. The\r\nbile-ducts have their connective tissue wall greatly sclerosed. These\r\nfuse with one another, forming areas of sclerosis devoid of liver\r\ntissue. As a result of these changes the liver cells atrophy and\r\nundergo fatty pigmentary and granular degeneration. Besides these\r\nchanges, due probably to the toxic action of the flukes, mechanical\r\nobstruction due to the actual plugging of the ducts by the flukes\r\ncauses retention of bile and icterus, and through pressure on veins,\r\nascites and hypertrophy of the spleen.\r\n\r\nTo what extent blood or bile respectively forms the food of the flukes\r\nis uncertain.\r\n\r\n_Life-history._--(Kobayashi, 1911, _Mitteilungen aus dem kaiserlichen\r\nInstitut für Infektions-Krankheiten zu Tokio_, pp. 58–62.)\r\n\r\nIt results from the work of Kobayashi in Japan that fresh-water fish\r\nform the _second_ intermediate host for _Clonorchis endemicus_. He\r\nfed cats with encysted flukes (cercariæ) from various fish and easily\r\nsucceeded in infecting them, _e.g._ a kitten, proved to be uninfected\r\nby repeated examination of its fæces, was fed on infected fish; a month\r\nlater innumerable flukes were found in the bile-ducts, gall-bladder,\r\npancreas and even in the duodenum. The fish infected were _Leucogobis\r\ngüntheri_, _Pseudorasbora parva_, and to a less extent _Acheclognathus\r\nlanceolata_, _Acheclognathus limbata_, _Paracheclognathus rhombea_,\r\n_Pseudoperilampus typus_, _Abbottina psegma_, _Biwia zezera_ and\r\n_Sarcocheilichthys variegatus_. The cysts occur throughout the muscles\r\nand subcutaneous tissue of the fish. Length 0·13 mm., breadth 0·1 mm.\r\nThe cercaria lies folded in the cyst, length 0·5 mm. breadth 0·1 mm.\r\nIt tapers posteriorly. Skin at first covered with fine spines,\r\ndisappearing as they grow older. Body dotted with fine pigment.\r\n\r\nThe _first_ intermediate host is still unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\nSub-family. *Metorchiinæ*, Lühe, 1909.\r\n\r\nGenus. *Metorchis*, Looss, 1899, emend. auctor.\r\n\r\n  Hind end rounded. Gut forks reach extreme end. Testes only slightly\r\n  lobed, filling the hind end.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Metorchis truncatus*, Rud., 1819.\r\n\r\nThis species, which attains a length of 2 mm., is slender and conical,\r\nthe anterior end is pointed and the posterior truncated, and provided\r\nwith a muscular tuberosity that resembles a terminal sucker; for\r\nthis reason the discoverer of the species (Rudolphi) classed it with\r\nthe Amphistomes. The cuticle in the young, as well as in the adult\r\nspecimens, is entirely and closely covered with spines. Suckers about\r\nequal in size (0·134 to 0·172 mm.); the ventral sticker lies somewhat\r\nin front of the middle of the body. The pharynx is small (0·09 mm.),\r\nthe œsophagus minute, the intestinal cæca reach to the posterior\r\nextremity. Between them, and in front of their blind ends, lie the two\r\nelliptical testes, one generally a little in front of the other. In\r\nfront of them, either in the median line or somewhat laterally, the\r\nspheroidal ovary is situated; in front, again, is the uterus, the coils\r\nof which usually extend beyond the median field. The vitellaria are at\r\nthe sides of the central third of the body, thus commencing in front of\r\nthe ventral sucker; cirrus pouch absent; the genital pore is close in\r\nfront of the acetabulum. The excretory pore is terminal (?). Eggs 29 µ\r\nby 11 µ.\r\n\r\n_Metorchis truncatus_ lives in the bile-ducts of the seal, cat, dog,\r\nfox, and glutton (_Gulo borealis_). The source of infection is unknown,\r\nalthough one would suspect fish. Askanazy did not succeed in getting\r\nthis fluke in his feeding experiments, but another species, _Metorchis\r\nalbidus_, not uncommon in cats by feeding them on roach (_Leuciscus\r\nrutilus_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 162.--_Metorchis truncatus_, Rud.: from the biliary\r\nducts of the domestic cat. _V.s._, ventral sucker; _I._, gut; _V.sc._,\r\nvitellaria; _T._, testes; _O._, ovary; _R.s._, receptaculum seminis;\r\n_Ut._, uterus. 25/1.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Heterophyiidæ*, Odhner, 1914.\r\n\r\nGenus. *Heterophyes*, Cobbold, 1866.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Cotylogonimus_, Lühe, 1899; _Cænogonimus_, Looss, 1899.\r\n\r\n  No crown of spines on head. Body divided into a narrow, movable,\r\n  anterior part (neck), and a broader, less movable, posterior\r\n  portion, which contains the genitalia. The suckers separated from\r\n  one another by a space equal to half the length of the body or more;\r\n  the pharynx is close behind the oral sucker; the œsophagus is long;\r\n  the intestinal cæca extend to the posterior border; the genital pore\r\n  is placed laterally, and behind the ventral sucker. Genital sucker\r\n  provided with a circlet of chitinous rodlets, shaped like stags’\r\n  horns. The testes are at the posterior end, the ovary in a median\r\n  position in front of them. Laurer’s canal with receptaculum seminis\r\n  present; the small vitellaria are at the sides of the posterior part\r\n  of the body. Parasitic in the intestine of mammals and birds.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Heterophyes heterophyes*, v. Sieb., 1852.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Distomum heterophyes_, v. Siebold, 1852; _Heterophyes\r\n  ægyptica_, Cobbold, 1866; _Mesogonimus heterophyes_, Railliet, 1890;\r\n  _Cœnogonimus heterophyes_, Looss 1900; _Cotylogonimus heterophyes_,\r\n  Braun, 1901.\r\n\r\nLength up to 2 mm., breadth 0·4 mm.; the neck not sharply defined; in\r\nlife it stretches to double the length of the hind body. The scales\r\nare rectangular, 5 µ to 6 µ by 4 µ, their posterior margin serrate\r\nwith seven to nine teeth. Cuticular glands are numerous on the ventral\r\nsurface, especially in the fore part of the body, and partly discharge\r\nat the anterior border of the oral sucker. The oral sucker is 0·09 mm.,\r\nthe ventral sucker 0·23 mm. in diameter; the pharynx measures 0·05\r\nto 0·07 mm. in length; the œsophagus is about three times as long;\r\nposteriorly the intestinal cæca are directed one towards the other and\r\nterminate beside the excretory bladder. Close in front of the posterior\r\nends of the intestinal branches are the two elliptical testes, which\r\nare not exactly on the same level. In the middle in front of them is\r\nthe receptaculum seminis, and in front of the latter lies the spherical\r\nor elliptical ovary. The two vasa efferentia unite to form the vas\r\ndeferens, which after a short course passes over into the angularly\r\nbent seminal vesicle; after the entry of the prostatic glands it\r\nbecomes united with the metraterm (vagina), and the common duct opens\r\ninto the genital sucker. The latter is somewhat smaller than the\r\nventral sucker, lateral to and close (0·15 mm.) behind it, and bears\r\na not entirely closed ring of from seventy-five to eighty chitinous\r\nrods (20 µ in length). The vitellaria on either side consist of about\r\nfourteen acini. The uterus is spread almost throughout the entire\r\nposterior part of the body. The eggs have thick shells with a knob\r\nresembling that of Clonorchis eggs but not so prominent, and measure\r\n30 µ by 17 µ; they contain a completely ciliated miracidium with a\r\nrudimentary intestinal sac.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 163.--_Heterophyes heterophyes_, v.

(After Looss.)]\r\n\r\nThis species was discovered in 1851 by Bilharz in the intestine of\r\na boy who died in Cairo; a second case was only found in 1891 and\r\npublished by R. Blanchard, so that it appeared as if the species were\r\nvery scarce. According to Looss, this is, however, not the case, but\r\nthe species easily escapes notice on account of its small size. Looss\r\nfound it in Alexandria twice in nine autopsies, and once in Cairo, and\r\nhas recently stated that in man “it is not at all uncommon to meet with\r\nthe parasite in cadavers, and the eggs of the worm in the stools of the\r\npatients.” Leiper records one case from Japan and one from China. The\r\nparasites occupy the middle third of the small intestine, and even when\r\npresent in large numbers appear to be harmless.\r\n\r\nThis small species, according to Looss, frequently occurs in Egyptian\r\ndogs, less so in cats, and has also been found in the fox, as well as\r\nonce in _Milvus parasiticus_; Janson also reports this species from the\r\nintestine of the dog in Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Metagonimus*, Katsurada, 1913; Yokogawa, Leiper, 1913.\r\n\r\nResembles in general structure Heterophyes. In the arrangement of\r\nits ventral genital suckers resembles but differs from that of\r\nTocotrema,[273] Looss. The ventral and genital suckers lie laterally\r\nand on the right.\r\n\r\n[273] In the genus Tocotrema the common genital duct opens into the\r\nventral sucker.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Metagonimus yokogawai.* Katsurada, 1913.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Yokogawa yokogawai_, Leiper, 1913.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 164.--_Metagonimus yokogawai_, Katsurada, 1913: the\r\nspines are only shown over a small part of the skin.

Ventral\r\nsucker characteristic and peculiar 0·12 to 0·14 mm. by 0·08 to 1 mm.\r\nIt is a sac-like organ placed deeply in the body, but does not open as\r\nin other flukes on the ventral surface. Testes elliptical, not quite\r\nsymmetrically placed at the hind end of the body. Vesicula seminalis\r\nretort-shaped, situated transversely, internal to the ventral sucker.\r\nPars prostatica present. Ejaculatory duct opens with the uterus into\r\na genital sinus, which, together with the internal opening of the\r\nventral sucker, opens into a pit at the front of the ventral sucker.\r\nThe opening of the genital sinus and that of the ventral sucker are\r\nfurnished with a complex muscular apparatus. Ovary spherical, 0·12 to\r\n0·13 mm. in diameter, lies in the middle of the hind body. Receptaculum\r\nseminis and Laurer’s canal present. Vitellaria in the hind half of the\r\nbody, consisting of about ten acini on each side. Shell gland to the\r\nleft of the ovary. Uterus forms three to four transverse coils. Eggs\r\nelliptical, double contoured, yellowish-brown in colour. There is no\r\nshoulder below the operculum as in the eggs of _Cl. sinensis_. At the\r\nrounder end there is a thickening or knob different from the spine-like\r\nor hook-like process seen in _Cl. sinensis_. Dimensions 28 µ by 16 µ.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Mainly in upper or middle portion of jejunum, rarely in\r\ncæcum. They penetrate deep into the mucosa, but not into the submucosa,\r\nand _post mortem_ appear as a number of small brown points. They\r\nfrequently occur in the solitary glands, which they destroy.

Pharynx globular, adjoining\r\nthe oral sucker; œsophagus 0·6 mm. in length; intestinal cæca reach\r\nto four-fifths of the body length. Genital pore at the level of the\r\nbifurcation of the intestine; cirrus pouch small and slender. The\r\nlarge, slightly lobed testes lie obliquely one behind the other behind\r\nthe ventral sucker; the ovary, which is considerably smaller, is placed\r\nbehind the posterior one; the vitellaria, commencing at the level\r\nof the posterior testis, terminate far before the cæca. The uterus,\r\nsituated behind the ovary, extends throughout the posterior end, not\r\nconfined to the central field, but overlapping the lateral fields with\r\nits transverse coils; at the posterior edge of the body it turns back\r\nagain and winds forwards to the ovary in transverse loops, then between\r\nthe testes, and finally, dorsal to the ventral sucker, terminates in\r\nthe genital pore. The thick-shelled eggs when young are yellowish,\r\nwhen older dark brown. They measure 38 µ to 45 µ by 22 µ to 30 µ.\r\nThey contain an oval or roundish miracidium, only the anterior part\r\nof which is ciliated, and which possesses a rudimentary intestinal\r\nsac with a boring spine. The miracidia do not hatch out in water\r\nspontaneously, but, according to Leuckart, in the intestines of slugs\r\n(_Limax_, _Avion_), but they do not develop either in these (slugs) or\r\nin water-snails.\r\n\r\nThe lancet fluke inhabits the biliary duct of herbivorous and\r\nomnivorous mammals (sheep, ox, goat, ass, horse, deer, hare, rabbit,\r\npig), and is often found associated with the liver fluke; it is not,\r\nhowever, so common nor so widely disseminated, nevertheless, it has\r\nbeen met with outside of Europe, namely, in Algeria, Egypt, Siberia,\r\nTurkestan, and North and South America.\r\n\r\nIn man it is still more uncommon than the liver fluke, and has hitherto\r\nonly been observed seven times (Germany, Bohemia, Italy, France, and\r\nEgypt); it may, however, have occurred more frequently, and have been\r\noverlooked, as in slight infections it produces no special symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe intermediate host is still unknown. Leuckart for some time held\r\nthe opinion that small species of _Planorbis_ from fresh water, which\r\ncontain encysted Distomata, were to blame, and he supported his views\r\nby a feeding experiment which seemingly yielded positive results; this,\r\nhowever, is not definitely proved. Piana’s statement that small land\r\nsnails are the intermediate hosts has also not been proved.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Echinostomidæ*, Looss, 1902.\r\n\r\nSub-family. *Echinostominæ*, Looss, 1899.\r\n\r\nGenus. *Echinostoma*, Rud. 1809; Dietz, 1910.\r\n\r\nFore-body not bulging.

The dorsal surface of the posterior part of\r\nthe body is covered with spinous papillæ. There are delicate spines\r\non the suckers, and larger ones invest the entire internal surface of\r\nthe gynæcophoric canal, as well as a longitudinal zone at the edge of\r\nthat side of the external surface that is covered by the other side\r\nrolling over it. The œsophagus is beset with numerous glandular cells\r\n(fig. 173), and presents two dilatations; the intestinal bifurcation is\r\nclose in front of the ventral sucker, the two branches uniting sooner\r\nor later behind the testes into a median trunk, which may again divide\r\nat short intervals. The excretory pore is at the posterior end, but\r\nplaced somewhat dorsally; the genital pore is at the beginning of the\r\ngynæcophoric canal, thus behind the ventral sucker; into it opens the\r\nvas deferens which, posteriorly, broadens into the seminal vesicle\r\nand then continues as the vasa efferentia of the four or five testes\r\n(fig. 173).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 172.--Transverse section through a pair of\r\n_Schistosoma hæmatobium_ in copulâ. In the male the point of reunion of\r\nthe intestinal forks has been cut across.

(After Looss.)]\r\n\r\n_The Female_--filiform, about 20 mm. in length, pointed at each\r\nend, and measuring 0·25 mm. in diameter in the middle. Their colour\r\nvaries according to the condition of the contents of the intestine.\r\n(Posteriorly they are dark brown or blackish.) The cuticle is smooth\r\nexcept in the sucker, where there are very delicate spines, and at the\r\nposterior end, where there are other larger spines. The oral sucker\r\nis a little larger than the pedunculated ventral sucker (0·07 and\r\n0·059 mm. respectively). The anterior part of the body, 0·2 to 0·3 mm.\r\nin length; the œsophagus is as in the male. The intestinal bifurcation\r\nis in front of the ventral sucker, the two branches uniting behind the\r\novary and the trunk running in a zigzag manner to the posterior border.\r\nThere are indications of diverticula at the flexures. The ovary is\r\nmedian. In young females it is of an elongated oval shape; in older\r\nfemales the posterior end becomes club-shaped, whereas the anterior\r\nend becomes attenuated; the oviduct originates at the posterior end,\r\nbut immediately turns forwards and joins the parallel vitelline duct\r\nin front of the ovary (fig. 174), where the shell gland cells open;\r\nthe common canal becomes dilated to form the oötype, and then proceeds\r\nas the uterus, with only slight convolutions, along the central field\r\nto the genital pore, which lies in the middle line immediately behind\r\nthe ventral sucker. The single vitellarium starts behind the ovary and\r\nextends to the posterior end. The acini are situated at the sides of\r\nthe excretory duct, which runs a median course. The eggs are compact\r\nspindles, much dilated in the middle; they have no lid, and are\r\nprovided with a terminal spine (rudimentary filament) at the posterior\r\nend, measuring 120 µ to 150 µ in length and 40 µ to 60 µ in breadth,\r\nbut vary in size and shape (fig. 175).\r\n\r\n_Distribution._--In order to understand the distribution of the worms\r\nand eggs in the body, it may be well to recall the blood supply of the\r\nabdominal and pelvic organs. It is generally assumed that the early\r\nlife (? cercarial stage) of the worms occurs in the liver, and that\r\nthe young worms travel from here, where they are invariably found, to\r\ntheir various sites along the portal vein and its tributaries and so\r\n_against_ the blood stream. The tributaries of the portal vein are:--\r\n\r\n(1) _Superior mesenteric_, the tributaries of which are: (_a_) the\r\nveins of the small intestine; (_b_) ileo-colic; (_c_) right colic;\r\n(_d_) middle colic; (_e_) right gastro-epiploic; and (_f_) inferior\r\npancreatic. By these paths infection of the small intestine, ascending\r\nand transverse colon and pancreas would occur.\r\n\r\n(2) _Splenic._ (Ova have been recorded by Symmers in the spleen.)\r\n\r\n(3) _Inferior mesenteric_, the tributaries of which are (_a_)\r\nsuperior hæmorrhoidal veins from the upper part of the hæmorrhoidal\r\nplexus; (_b_) sigmoid veins from sigmoid flexure and lower portion of\r\n_descending_ colon; (_c_) left colic vein draining descending colon.\r\n\r\nThe superior hæmorrhoidal veins form a rich plexus in the rectum, and\r\nbelow this level in the upper and middle parts of the anal canal. The\r\nplexus forms two networks, an _internal_ plexus in the submucosa and\r\nan external on the outer surface. The _internal_ plexus opens at the\r\nanal orifice into: (_a_) branches of the inferior hæmorrhoidal vein\r\n(from the pudic); (_b_) the external plexus. The _external_ plexus\r\ngives off: (_a_) inferior hæmorrhoidal opening into internal pudic\r\n(of _internal iliac_ vein); (_b_) mid-hæmorrhoidal into _internal\r\niliac_ or its branches; and (_c_) superior hæmorrhoidal opening into\r\ninferior mesenteric. The external plexus further communicates with the\r\nvesico-prostatic plexus. The vesico-prostatic (vaginal) plexus opens\r\ninto the _vesical veins_, which drain into the interior iliac vein.\r\nThis plexus also receives afferents from the pudendal plexus, the chief\r\ntributary of which is the dorsal vein of the penis. The pudendal plexus\r\nalso receives branches from the inferior pudic and the anterior surface\r\nof the bladder.\r\n\r\nThere is thus a communication between the portal vein and the vena cava\r\nby means of these plexuses, _viz._, through the inferior and middle\r\nhæmorrhoidals, and by the inferior hæmorrhoidals to the bladder and\r\nthence by the vesical veins or the pudic to the caval system (interior\r\niliac).\r\n\r\nIt is thus by the inferior mesenteric and its tributaries that the\r\nworms reach the descending colon, rectum, anal canal, and eventually\r\nthe bladder, and in some cases the caval system.\r\n\r\nBefore considering what is actually found _post mortem_ in these veins\r\nand the organs drained by them, we may further recall the fact that the\r\ncalibre of “medium” veins is 4 to 8 mm., “small” veins less than 40 µ\r\nin diameter and capillaries 8 µ to 20 µ. Further, the maximum diameter\r\nof the male worm is 1 mm., that of the female 280 µ and eggs _in utero_\r\n80 µ to 90 µ long by 30 µ to 40 µ.\r\n\r\n_Liver and Portal Vein._--Here worms are most easily found _post\r\nmortem_. Often only males are found and these of the same size, and\r\nif females occur only a few worms are found in copulâ. The worms are\r\nfrequently not full size and the males may contain no free spermatozoa\r\nin their testes, and as regards the females some may be fertilized,\r\nothers not, as shown by the presence or absence of spermatozoa in\r\nthe seminal receptacle or uterus. In either case they may contain\r\neggs--_lateral-spined_--usually one, less often two, but there may be\r\nas many as five or six. These eggs may also show some abnormality,\r\nwhich takes the form of: (1) abnormal contents, _viz._, disintegrating\r\nyolk cells with or without an ovarian cell; (2) abnormal shape but with\r\nnormal contents and probably represented by the collapsed and empty\r\negg-shells which are found in the tissues.\r\n\r\nAs to the interpretation of these facts, Looss believes that these\r\nlateral-spined eggs are products of young females whose egg-laying is\r\nnot at first properly regulated. The shape that the eggs take, _viz._,\r\nwith a lateral spine, is determined by an excess of material--ovarian\r\nand yolk cells--being present in the oötype. The shape of eggs depends\r\nupon the position they have in the oötype during their formation. In\r\nyoung females an excess of cells--yolk cells especially--accumulates,\r\ndistending not only the dorsal wall but a portion also of the short\r\nduct joining the oötype to the uterus. The result of this is that\r\nthe axis of the oötype and egg is almost transverse to the body, and\r\nthe posterior funnel-shaped portion of the oötype, instead of being\r\nterminal, has now a lateral or rather a ventral position, so that the\r\nspine which occupies this portion, instead of being terminal, is now\r\nlateral. It is noteworthy that these lateral-spined eggs are thicker,\r\nowing to the excess of material present, and not uncommonly have a\r\ncurved anterior border, due to a projection of the anterior end into\r\nthe anterior opening of the oötype.\r\n\r\nAs these eggs are being laid by females in the portal vein they are\r\ncarried back to the liver by the blood stream. The liver is one of the\r\ncommonest sites for these eggs; also terminal-spined eggs may be found\r\nhere for the same reason.\r\n\r\n_Hæmorrhoidal Veins._--Mature worms, generally in copulâ, are usually\r\nfound here, though young not fully grown females may also occur. The\r\ntissues of the rectal wall (or colon) show, as a rule, large quantities\r\nof lateral-spined eggs, though less often only terminal-spined eggs may\r\nbe found.\r\n\r\n_Vesico-prostatic Plexus._--Worms in copulâ are found in the veins of\r\nthe submucosa in the bladder, and the eggs in the mucosa, and those\r\nvoided are usually terminal-spined, though lateral-spined eggs are not\r\nso rare as generally thought. The problem next arises as to how the\r\neggs get to the lumen of the gut or bladder.\r\n\r\nThe female worm is 280 µ in diameter. Veins in the submucosa of the\r\nrectum less than 178 µ in diameter are not affected with endophlebitis.\r\nIt is probable that the female even by stretching could not penetrate\r\nmuch beyond this. Eggs are probably then laid in the submucosa as near\r\nthe muscularis mucosa as possible. Now if the eggs are laid in a vein\r\nof larger calibre than the worm fills, the eggs would be carried back\r\nto the inferior mesenteric vein, so that presumably the worm must\r\nsucceed in blocking the vein already narrowed by endophlebitis, so that\r\nby the stasis which ensues the eggs may escape from the veins. How this\r\noccurs is not exactly known; it is not necessarily due to the spine,\r\nas the same escape into the tissues occurs in spineless eggs, such\r\nas those of _Schistosoma japonicum_. The eggs, then, pass as foreign\r\nbodies through the tissues. Another hypothesis is that the worms leave\r\nthe veins in order to lay their eggs, but the evidence is against this.\r\n\r\n_Caval System._--Occasionally worms that have passed through the\r\nvesical plexus may be found in the iliac vein, inferior vena cava, and\r\neven the lungs. If the worms are young they contain a lateral-spined\r\negg; if adult, numerous (50 to 100) terminal-spined eggs.\r\n\r\n_Lungs._--When the liver is strongly infected with (terminal-spined)\r\neggs it is possible that by passive movements some may pass into the\r\nintralobular veins, and thence by the inferior vena cava to the lungs.\r\n\r\n_Gall-bladder._--Similarly terminal-spined eggs pass into the\r\nbile-capillaries and gall-bladder (where they may be abundant), and so\r\ninto the fæces.\r\n\r\n_Detection of Eggs._--Occasionally eggs may be found in various other\r\nparts of the body. They are best detected by macerating pieces of the\r\ntissue in question in about 1/4 per cent. hydrochloric acid at 50 to\r\n60°C. (Looss).\r\n\r\nPathological changes:--\r\n\r\n_Rectum._--These have been studied thoroughly by Letulle in the case of\r\nan apparently pure infection of the rectum.[274] They take the form of\r\na chronic diffuse inflammation, which may result in--(1) ulceration, or\r\n(2) hyperplasia of the mucosa, producing adenomata.\r\n\r\n[274] It is noteworthy that in this almost classical case no worms were\r\nfound in any of the sections. It is further noteworthy that the eggs in\r\nthe rectum showed great irregularity of form. Eggs with a spine at each\r\nend were not uncommon; exceptionally eggs with two polar spines and one\r\nlateral.\r\n\r\n_Ulcerative Form._--The _mucosa_ is transformed into a mass of vascular\r\nconnective tissue. The connective tissue spaces next become invaded\r\nby numerous mononuclear cells. The tissue itself undergoes diffuse\r\nsclerosis, becoming hard and fibroid. Eventually ulcerative necrosis\r\nsets in. During these changes the Lieberkühn glands are destroyed. The\r\nprocess does not extend to the submucosa, in this respect differing\r\nfrom that in chronic dysentery.\r\n\r\n_Hyperplastic Form._--The Lieberkühn glands of the mucosa at first\r\nhypertrophy; then there is an actual hyperplasia resulting in\r\nadenomata. The interstitial tissue of the glands is also greatly\r\nhypertrophied, giving rise to very vascular granulations. These growths\r\nare often hollow and contain worms. Many eggs are found in the mucosa\r\non their way to the lumen of the gut.\r\n\r\nThe _muscularis mucosa_ is thickened up to twice or even ten times the\r\nnormal. Its vessels are dilated (36 µ to 80 µ), but they do not allow\r\nof the passage of worms.\r\n\r\nThe _submucosa_ is profoundly changed; rigid and hard instead of\r\nsupple. It is here that the greatest number of eggs occur. A remarkable\r\ncondition of endophlebitis exists in the veins of the submucosa, not\r\nonly in the smaller ones but also in the larger ones (370 µ by 270 µ).\r\nThis endophlebitis results in a more or less complete occlusion of the\r\nvessels of the lumen.\r\n\r\nThe _muscular coats_ are free from change, also their veins.\r\n\r\nThe _Serous Coats_.--The veins about 1,900 µ, also show endophlebitis.\r\nBesides the rectum, in extreme cases even the transverse colon, the\r\ncæcum and small intestine may be affected.\r\n\r\n_Bladder._--In the early stages the mucosa is deep red and swollen\r\nlike velvet, or there may be localized patches of hyperæmia or\r\nextravasation. The subsequent changes take two chief forms:--\r\n\r\n(1) _Sandy Patches._--The mucosa looks as if it were impregnated with a\r\nfine brownish or yellowish powder (myriads of ova). This is accompanied\r\nby a gradual hypertrophy and new formation of connective tissue, so\r\nthat dry, hard or plate-like patches with this sandy appearance arise;\r\nthe thickening eventually affects all the coats of the bladder. In the\r\nolder patches many of the eggs are calcified. These patches sooner\r\nor later break down, ulcerate and necrose. Phosphatic deposits are\r\nabundant and stone is common. These patches are not found in the rectum.\r\n\r\n(2) _Papillomata._--Where the inflammatory change produced by the eggs\r\ngives rise to hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the mucosa, papillomata\r\nresult, the axis of which is formed by connective tissue of the\r\nsubmucosa. These are most variable in shape and form and bleed readily,\r\nand sometimes contain cavities of extravasated blood.\r\n\r\nAs in the rectum, it is in the submucosa that eggs are most abundant,\r\nand worms in copulâ occur in the veins of this layer, but endophlebitis\r\nis not as general as described in the rectum. Malignant disease of\r\nthe bladder is not an uncommon sequela of bilharziasis. Besides the\r\nbladder, the ureters and kidneys may in advanced cases be involved. The\r\nprostate and vesiculæ seminales are commonly diseased. Eggs have been\r\nrecorded in the semen. The urethra is frequently attacked; the vagina\r\nin the female.\r\n\r\nEggs also occur in the lymphatic glands of the gut.\r\n\r\n_Geographical Distribution._--East Africa: Nile Valley, Red Sea Coast,\r\nZanzibar, Portuguese East Africa, Delagoa Bay, Natal, Port Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nSouth Africa: Cape Colony, Orange Free State, Transvaal, Mauritius,\r\nBourbon, Madagascar.\r\n\r\nWest Africa: Angola, Cameroons, Gold Coast, Gambia, Senegal, Sierra\r\nLeone, Lagos, Nigeria.\r\n\r\nNorth Africa: Tripoli, Tunis, Algeria, parts of the Sahara.\r\n\r\nCentral Africa: Sudan, various portions. Uganda, Nyasaland.\r\n\r\nIt occurs with varying frequency in these regions. It is probably more\r\nwidely spread than this list implies, as undoubtedly many cases are\r\nseen which are not recorded.\r\n\r\nIsolated cases have been recorded from Arabia, India,[275] Greece,\r\nCyprus.\r\n\r\n[275] In a case from Madras, recorded by Stephens and Christophers,\r\nthe eggs were long and spindle-shaped, quite unlike the eggs of\r\n_Schistosoma hæmatobium_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 174.--_Schistosoma hæmatobium_, Bilh.: genitalia of\r\nthe female. _V.s._, ventral sucker; _I._, gut cæca; _V.d._, vitelline\r\nduct; _V.sc._, vitellarium; _O._, ovary; _Oe._, œsophagus; _Sh._, shell\r\ngland; _U._, uterus. Magnified. (After Leuckart.)]\r\n\r\nThe means by which infection is brought about are still uncertain; we\r\nonly know that the miracidia (fig. 175) enclosed in the discharged\r\neggs do not hatch if the eggs remain in the urine, but after cooling\r\nperish. As soon, however, as the urine is diluted with water the shell\r\nswells, generally bursting lengthways, and releases the miracidium from\r\nits investing membrane, so that it can swim about with the aid of its\r\ncilia. In its structure it differs but little from the miracidium of\r\n_Fasciola hepatica_, as, for instance, in the lack of eyes; the two\r\nlarge gland cells situated on either side of the intestinal sac are\r\nalso present in the miracidia of _Fasciola hepatica_.\r\n\r\n_Sarcode Globules._--This is a term applied to certain globules which\r\nat times appear in the miracidium and are later ejected. Some authors\r\nconsider them as indicative that the miracidium has developed into a\r\nsporocyst, but Looss considers them to be degeneration products.\r\n\r\nThe Bilharzia mission, under R. T. Leiper, sent to Egypt by the War\r\nOffice early in 1915, reports that cercariæ of bilharzia type were\r\nrecognized in four of the commonest fresh-water molluscs around Cairo.\r\n\r\nWith material obtained from naturally infected _Planorbis boissyi_\r\nacute bilharziosis was experimentally produced in rats, mice, and\r\nmonkeys. Infection takes place experimentally through the skin and also\r\nthrough the mucous membrane of the mouth and œsophagus. The miracidium,\r\nafter entering the mollusc, develops into a sporocyst. This gives rise\r\nnot to rediæ, but to secondary sporocysts, which, in turn, produce\r\ncercariæ. These, like the adult worm, differ from other distomes in\r\nlacking a muscular pharynx.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Schistosoma mansoni*, Sambon, 1907.\r\n\r\nAccording to Manson, Sambon and others, the eggs with lateral spines\r\nbelong to a species different from _Schistosoma hæmatobium_. Infections\r\nwith this species only are said to occur in the Congo, Southern States\r\nof North America, West Indies (Guadeloupe) and Brazil (Bahia). The\r\nfollowing characters, according to Flu, differentiate this species: (1)\r\nIn the male the transition from the anterior portion of the worm to\r\nthe lateral fields (the infolded portions which form the gynæcophoric\r\ncanal) is not a gradual one as in _Schistosoma hæmatobium_, but in this\r\ncase the lateral fields rise suddenly, almost at right angles to the\r\nanterior portion. (2) The ovaries have a well-marked convoluted course\r\nas in no other schistosome. (3) The oötype is symmetrical in reference\r\nto the long axis of the body, its duct being lateral on the ventral\r\nside (Looss’ explanation of this we have already given). (4) The worms\r\nlive exclusively in portal vein and tract. (As lateral-spined eggs\r\noccur also in the bladder, this is not exactly true.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 175.--Ovum of _Schistosoma hæmatobium_, Bilh., with\r\nmiracidium, which has turned its anterior end towards the posterior end\r\nof the egg. 275/1.

The ventral sucker is stalked and somewhat larger than\r\nthe oral sucker. Both suckers are larger than the corresponding\r\nones in _S. hæmatobium_. Body usually smooth, but in the fresh\r\nstate numerous fairly evident spines along the margin of the canal.\r\nŒsophagus: two bulbs. The junction of the gut forks more posterior than\r\nin _S. hæmatobium_, the median united gut stem occupying a quarter to\r\none-fifth to one-sixth of the body length. An excretory canal runs\r\nalong each side of the body, opening into the dorsal excretory pore.\r\nTestes irregularly elliptical, six to eight in number, in the anterior\r\npart of hind-body. The vasa efferentia unite into a common vas deferens\r\nwhich opens directly behind the ventral sucker. The seminal vesicle\r\nlies just behind this.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 176.--_Schistosoma japonicum_: anterior end with\r\ntestes; posterior end with point of union of cæca. Length of worm about\r\n10 mm. (After Katsurada.)]\r\n\r\n_Female._--Up to 26 mm., generally thinner than the male. Surface\r\nsmooth. Suckers armed with fine spines. Ventral sucker larger than\r\noral. Body thicker behind the region of the ovary. The gut forks unite\r\nimmediately behind the ovary. The united gut much thicker than in _S.\r\nhæmatobium_. Ovary elliptical, almost in the mid-body, its hinder\r\nportion dilated. The oviduct arises from its posterior end and then\r\nruns sinuously forward, where it is joined by the vitellarian duct;\r\nthe vitellarium well developed, extending from behind the ovary almost\r\nbut not quite to the posterior end as in _S. hæmatobium_. Shell gland\r\nducts enter at the junction point of oviduct and vitelline duct. The\r\ncanal here forms an oötype and then proceeds as the uterus to open\r\ndirectly behind the ventral sucker. The uterus occupies almost half\r\nthe hind-body. In _S. hæmatobium_ this is not so. The uterine canal is\r\ncleft-like, _i.e._, its dorso-ventral diameter is much greater than its\r\nlateral diameter. The number of eggs varies from about 50 to 300 from\r\nobservations made in various hosts.\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--_In utero_ assume various shapes, as they are soft; the lumen\r\nof the uterus is narrow. Outside they are oval, faint yellow, double\r\ncontoured. In fæces the eggs measure 83·5 µ, by 62·5 µ (man); 85 µ by\r\n61·5 µ (cattle); 98·2 µ by 73·8 µ (dog). The eggs have either small\r\nlateral spines or thickenings, and Looss at the opposite side has\r\ndescribed cap-like thickenings. The eggs in the tissues undergo various\r\ndeformities, and may contain a miracidium, as also the eggs in fæces\r\ndo; or the contents may consist of granular matter or amorphous masses\r\nor they may be calcified. Lymphocytes and giant cells may also invade\r\nthe eggs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 177.--_Schistosoma japonicum_, male and female in\r\ncopulâ. × 60.

(After Looss.)]\r\n\r\n_Mode of Infection._--The miracidia hatch in water in as little as\r\nfifteen minutes, but the majority in one to three hours. They will\r\nlive in water for about twenty-four hours. In water they undergo a\r\ntransformation into “larvæ,” which then penetrate the skin, as has been\r\nshown by Japanese writers to hold good for man, cattle, dog and cat.\r\nThe penetration of the skin is attended with an eruption on the legs,\r\n“Kabure.” The exact route by which the worms reach the portal vein\r\nis uncertain. Infection in Japan takes place from spring to autumn,\r\nespecially May to July, when the soil is contaminated with manure\r\nof cattle infected with _S. japonicum_. They also appear to develop\r\nin molluscs. Leiper and Atkinson found cercariæ (in sporocysts) in\r\nthe liver of a mollusc, _Katayama nosophora_. They infected mice by\r\nimmersing them in water containing liver emulsion and so free cercariæ,\r\nthus confirming the similar results of Miyairi and Suzuki.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 179.--_Schistosoma japonicum_: from dog.

Egg from\r\nfæces. × c. 800. (After Katsurada.)]\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--The worm occurs in Japan, China, and the Philippines. The\r\nnormal host is man and mammals. Cattle, dog and cat are often found\r\nnaturally infected. Mice can also be experimentally infected. Their\r\nseat of election is the portal vein and its branches, especially the\r\nmesenteric veins. They either swim free in the blood or remain fixed\r\nby their suckers to the intima of the vessels. They have also been\r\nfound in the vena cava and right heart of a cat, but not so far in the\r\nvesical plexus.\r\n\r\nEggs are found in the submucosa and mucosa of the gut, especially the\r\ncolon, and at times in the serosa and subserosa of the small intestine,\r\nwhere they give rise to new growths. Occasionally eggs are found in the\r\nbrain. The life of the worms is at least two years.\r\n\r\n_Pathogenic Effects._--Anæmia through loss of blood due to worms;\r\nenlarged spleen, toxic in origin (?); phlebitis, thrombosis, due to\r\nportal stasis; the eggs, however, cause the greatest mischief. They\r\nare carried by the circulation to various organs where they produce\r\ninflammation, granulation tissue, and later connective tissue.\r\n\r\n_Liver._--The eggs reaching this organ give rise to granulomata and\r\nhence enlarged liver, and later, when connective tissue is formed, to\r\ncontraction. The surface is rough and irregularly granular, “parasitic\r\nembolic cirrhosis” of Yamagiwa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 182.--_Schistosoma japonicum_: section through the\r\ngut of a Chinaman showing eggs. × 58. (After Catto.)]\r\n\r\n_Gut._--The eggs in the mucosa and submucosa cause catarrh and\r\ndestruction of tissue or new growth. In the small intestine the eggs\r\nare mainly in the serosa and subserosa, where they give rise to\r\npolypoid or branched growths.\r\n\r\n_Spleen._--Enlarged, at first due to toxin (?) and later due to portal\r\nstasis. Eggs in the spleen are uncommon.\r\n\r\n_Ascites_ also arises from the portal stasis, and is generally present\r\nin advanced cases.\r\n\r\nEggs may be found in many other situations: glands (numerous),\r\nmesentery, stomach, pancreas, kidney, etc. The bladder remains free.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 183.--_Schistosoma japonicum_: liver showing eggs\r\nin the intra- and interlobular connective tissue. × c. 80. (After\r\nKatsurada.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nClass III. *CESTODA*, Rud., 1808.\r\n\r\n  Tapeworms have been known from ancient times--at all events, the\r\n  large species inhabiting the intestines of man--and there has never\r\n  been a doubt as to their animal nature. The large cysticerci of the\r\n  domestic animals (occasionally of man also) have been known for an\r\n  equally long period, but they were generally regarded as growths,\r\n  or “hydatids,” until almost simultaneously Redi in Italy, and\r\n  Hartmann and Wepfer in Germany, concluded from their movements and\r\n  organization that they were of animal nature. From that time the\r\n  cysticerci have been included amongst the other intestinal worms, and\r\n  Zeder (1800) established a special class (_Cystici_, Rud., 1808) for\r\n  the bladder worms. Things remained in this condition until the middle\r\n  of the last century, when Küchenmeister, by means of successful\r\n  feeding experiments, demonstrated that the cysticerci were definite\r\n  stages of development of certain tapeworms. Before Küchenmeister, E.\r\n  Blanchard, van Beneden, and v. Siebold had held the same opinion in\r\n  regard to other asexual Cestodes.\r\n\r\n  Since the most remote period another question has again and\r\n  again occupied the attention of naturalists, the question of the\r\n  morphological nature--that of the INDIVIDUALITY OF THE TAPEWORM. The\r\n  ancients, who were well acquainted with the proglottids (_Vermes\r\n  cucurbitani_) that are frequently evacuated, were of the opinion\r\n  that the tapeworm originated through the union of these separate\r\n  proglottids, and this view was maintained until the end of the\r\n  seventeenth century. In 1683 Tyson discovered the head with the\r\n  double circlet of hooks in a large tapeworm of the dog; Redi (1684)\r\n  was also acquainted with the head and the suckers of several Tæniæ.\r\n  Andry (1700) found the head of _Tænia saginata_, and Bonnet (1777)\r\n  and Gleichen-Rusworm (1779) found the head of _Dibothriocephalus\r\n  latus_. Consequently most authors, on the ground of this discovery,\r\n  considered the tapeworm as a single animal, that maintains its hold\r\n  in the intestine by means of the head, and likewise feeds itself\r\n  through it. The fact was recognized that there were longitudinal\r\n  canals running through the entire length of the worm, and it was\r\n  thought that these originated in the suckers, and that the entire\r\n  apparatus was an intestine. As, moreover, the segments form at the\r\n  neck, and are cast off from the opposite extremity, the tapeworm\r\n  was also compared with the polyps, which were formerly regarded as\r\n  independent beings.\r\n\r\n  Steenstrup, in his celebrated work on the alternation of generations\r\n  (1841), was the first to give another explanation. This has been\r\n  elaborated still further by van Beneden, v. Siebold and Leuckart,\r\n  and until a few years ago all authorities adopted his views.\r\n  According to this view, the tapeworm is composed of numerous\r\n  individuals, something like a polyp colony, and, in addition to the\r\n  proglottids--the sexual individuals which are usually present in\r\n  large numbers--there is ONE individual of different structure, the\r\n  _scolex_, which not only fastens the entire colony to the intestine,\r\n  but actually produces this colony from itself, and therefore is\r\n  present earlier than the proglottids. The scolex is a “nurse,”\r\n  which, though itself produced by sexual means, increases asexually\r\n  like a _Scyphistoma_ polyp; the tapeworm chain has therefore been\r\n  termed a _strobila_. Consequently the development of the tapeworms\r\n  was explained by an alternation of generations. In support of this\r\n  opinion it was demonstrated not only that the adult sexual creatures,\r\n  the proglottids, can separate from the colony and live independently\r\n  for a time, but that in certain Tæniæ, and especially in many\r\n  Cestodes of the shark, the proglottids detach themselves long before\r\n  they have attained their ultimate size, and thus separated continue\r\n  to develop, grow and finally multiply; the scolex also exhibits a\r\n  certain independence in so far as, though not, as a rule, capable of\r\n  a free life, yet it in some cases lives as a free being, partly on\r\n  the surface of the body of marine fishes and partly in the sea. With\r\n  the more intimate knowledge of the development of the cysticerci,\r\n  the independent nature of the scolex was recognized. It is formed by\r\n  a budding of the bladder that has developed from the oncosphere, in\r\n  some cases (Cœnurus) in large numbers, in other cases (Echinococcus)\r\n  only after the parent cyst has developed several daughter cysts.\r\n  Released from its mother cyst and placed in suitable conditions,\r\n  it goes on living, and gives rise at its posterior end by budding\r\n  to the strobila, the proglottids of which eventually become sexual\r\n  individuals.\r\n\r\n  In order to make this clearer we will briefly summarize what takes\r\n  place in the jelly-fishes.\r\n\r\n  By _metamorphosis_ is meant a developmental change in the _same_\r\n  individual, while alternation of generations, or _metagenesis_,\r\n  implies a stage in which _reproduction_ of individuals takes place by\r\n  a process of budding or fission. This _asexual_ reproductive stage\r\n  _alternates_ with the _sexual_ mode of reproduction. Thus in the\r\n  development of the Scyphozoa (jelly-fishes) we have:--\r\n\r\n  (1) The fertilized egg cell divides regularly and forms a _morula_.\r\n\r\n  (2) By accumulation of fluid in the interior this becomes a closed\r\n  sac with a wall formed of a single layer of cells, forming the\r\n  _blastosphere_ or _blastula_.\r\n\r\n  (3) One end of the sac is invaginated, forming a _gastrula_.\r\n\r\n  (4) The gastrula pore or mouth closes, forming again a sac, the walls\r\n  of which have two layers, forming a _planula_.\r\n\r\n  (5) This becomes fixed to a rock, an invagination forms at one end,\r\n  a depression--the stomodæum--communicating with the enteric cavity.\r\n  Tentacles grow out and we have a _Scyphozoön polype_, _Scyphistoma_\r\n  or _Scyphula_. It is to this stage that Steenstrup gave the name\r\n  “nurse” (“wet-nurse”), because it nourished or produced asexually the\r\n  succeeding forms.\r\n\r\n  (6) _Asexual reproduction_ by transverse fission occurs in this,\r\n  forming a pile of saucer- or pine-cone-like animals which before this\r\n  time had been considered to be a distinct animal, which was called\r\n  _strobila_ from its resemblance to a pine-cone. This is the alternate\r\n  generation.\r\n\r\n  (7) The individuals of the strobila become free and are called\r\n  _Ephyrulæ_.\r\n\r\n  (8) These develop finally into adult sexual jelly-fish, _Scyphozoa_,\r\n  so that comparing a tapeworm with this we have (_a_) egg, (_b_)\r\n  scolex (= Scyphula or “nurse”), (_c_) asexual reproduction of the\r\n  tapeworm chain (= strobila), (_d_) development of the individuals of\r\n  the chain (proglottids) into sexual adults.\r\n\r\n  Van Beneden’s terminology for these stages is the following: Ciliated\r\n  embryo = protoscolex; scyphistoma = deutoscolex (or scolex); free\r\n  Ephyrula = proglottis. According to this view, as is the case in many\r\n  endoparasitic Trematodes, asexual reproduction by budding occurs\r\n  at two stages of the whole cycle of development, _viz._ (1) in the\r\n  formation of the scolex by budding from the bladder (“nurse”), (2) in\r\n  the formation of the strobila by budding from the scolex (“nurse”).\r\n\r\n  But in cysticercal larval forms it appears that the scolex does not\r\n  arise in this way but is simply a part of the proscolex (hexacanth\r\n  embryo), becoming invaginated into it for protection, so that there\r\n  is no asexual gemmation here. It has been questioned also whether\r\n  the strobila also arises by gemmation. If it does, the tapeworm is a\r\n  _colony_ of zoöids produced by budding from the asexual scolex; if\r\n  it is not produced in this way, then the tapeworm is to be regarded\r\n  as an _individual_ in which growth is accompanied by segmentation.\r\n  Against the “colony” view are the facts that the muscular, nervous,\r\n  and excretory systems are continuous throughout the worm, and that\r\n  some tapeworms, such as _Ligula_, are unsegmented.\r\n\r\n  Finally, if the tapeworm is an individual the question arises\r\n  which is the head end. As new segments are formed at the neck,\r\n  and as this point in annelids is the antepenultimate segment, the\r\n  scolex must be the last or posterior segment. The caudal vesicle\r\n  or bladder of larval forms is consequently anterior. According to\r\n  this view, in tapeworms as among many endoparasitic flukes, an\r\n  _asexual_ multiplication occurs at two points of the whole cycle\r\n  of development, which is as follows: (1) egg, (2) oncosphere or\r\n  hexacanth embryo, (3) bladder (cysticercus or hydatid), (4) (after\r\n  digestion of the bladder) by budding, the scolex, (5) by budding from\r\n  the scolex the sexual proglottids, (6) the egg; (4) and (5) being the\r\n  two asexual stages.\r\n\r\n\r\nANATOMY OF THE CESTODA.\r\n\r\nIf we except the tapeworms with only one proglottis, the CESTOIDEA\r\nMONOZOA, Lang = _Cestodaria_, Monticelli, we can always distinguish in\r\nthe Cestodes, in the narrower sense, one scolex or head and a large or\r\nsmall number of segments (proglottids). The SCOLEX serves the entire\r\ntapeworm for fastening it to the internal surface of the intestinal\r\nwall, and therefore carries at its end various organs which assist\r\nin this function, and which are as follows: (i) SUCTORIAL ORGANS,\r\n_i.e._, the four suckers (acetabula), which are placed crosswise at the\r\ncircumference of the thickened end of the scolex; further, the double\r\nor quadruple groove-like suckers (bothridia), which are diversely\r\nshaped in the various genera and families.[276] (2) FIXATION ORGANS\r\n(hooklets)[277] that likewise occur in varying numbers and different\r\npositions; they may be in the suckers, or outside them on the apex of\r\nthe scolex; for instance, in many of the _Tæniidæ_ they appear in a\r\ncircle around a single protractile organ, the rostellum, or the latter\r\nmay be rudimentary, and is then replaced by a terminal sucker. (3)\r\nPROBOSCIS. One family of the Cestodes, the _Rhynchobothriidæ_, carries\r\nfour proboscides, moved by their own muscular apparatus, on the scolex,\r\nand they are beset with the most diverse hooks. (4) TENTACLE-LIKE\r\nformations are only known in one genus (Polypocephalus).\r\n\r\n[276] They may remain simple, and are then not separated from the\r\nremaining muscles of the scolex; or they project as roundish or\r\nelongated structures over the scolex, hollow on their free surface, and\r\noften divided into numerous areas by muscular transverse ribs. They may\r\nalso carry accessory suckers on their surface.\r\n\r\n[277] The various parts of a hooklet are thus named from the point\r\nbackwards: (1) blade or prong, (2) guard or ventral or posterior root,\r\n(3) handle or dorsal or anterior root.\r\n\r\nThe thickened part of the scolex that carries the suckers is usually\r\ncalled the head; the following flat (unsegmented) part connecting\r\nit with the proglottids is called the neck, and is sometimes quite\r\nsmall. In a few cases the entire scolex (or head) disappears, and its\r\nfunction is then undertaken by the contiguous portion of the chain of\r\nproglottids, which is transformed into a variously shaped PSEUDO-SCOLEX.\r\n\r\nThe proglottids are joined to the scolex in a longitudinal row, and are\r\narranged according to age in such a manner that the oldest proglottis\r\nis farthest from the scolex, and the youngest nearest to it.\r\n\r\nThe number of segments varies, according to the species, from only a\r\nfew to several thousands; they are either quadrangular or rectangular;\r\nin the latter case their longitudinal axis falls either longitudinal\r\nor transverse to that of the entire chain, according as the segments\r\nare longer than broad or broader than long. When the number of segments\r\nis very large, the youngest ones are, as a rule, transversely oblong,\r\nthe middle ones are squarish, and the mature ones longitudinally\r\noblong. The posterior border of the segments, as a rule, carries a\r\nlongitudinal groove for the reception of the shorter anterior border\r\nof the following proglottis. The two lateral borders of the segment\r\nare rectilinear, but converge more or less towards the front, or they\r\nare bent outwards. In most of the Cestodes the segments, just as the\r\nneck, are very flat; in rare cases their transverse diameter is equal\r\nto their dorso-ventral diameter. As a rule the segments, singly or\r\nseveral united together, detach themselves from the posterior end, in\r\nmany cases only after complete maturity is attained, and in others\r\nmuch earlier; they then continue to live near their parent colony, to\r\nstill call it by that name, in the same intestine and continue their\r\ndevelopment. Even when evacuated from the intestine the proglottids\r\nunder favourable circumstances can continue to live and creep about,\r\nuntil sooner or later they perish.\r\n\r\nThe first proglottis formed, and which in a complete tapeworm [_i.e._,\r\nsexually complete] is the most posterior, is as a rule smaller and\r\nof different shape, it also frequently remains sterile, as likewise\r\nhappens in the next (younger) segments in a few species; otherwise,\r\nhowever, sooner or later the generative organs develop in all the\r\nsegments, mostly singly, sometimes in pairs; in the latter case they\r\nmay be quite distinct from each other or possess some parts in common.\r\nThe term “mature” is used for a proglottid that has the sexual organs\r\nfully developed, while “gravid” is used for one containing eggs. Most\r\nof the species combine male and female genitalia in the same segment,\r\nonly a few are sexually distinct (Diœcocestus). In the hermaphrodite\r\nspecies one male and one female sexual orifice are always present,\r\nand, in addition, there may be a second female orifice, the uterine\r\nopening; as a rule, however, this is lacking, and in one sub-family,\r\nthe _Acoleinæ_, to which also the genus Diœcocestus belongs, the other\r\nsexual orifice, the opening of the vagina, is also absent. The position\r\nof these orifices varies; the cirrus and vagina usually open into a\r\ncommon atrium on one lateral border or on a surface of the segments;\r\nthe orifice of the uterus may be on the same surface or on the opposite\r\none.\r\n\r\nThe surface on which the uterus opens is termed the VENTRAL SURFACE;\r\nif this orifice is absent, one must depend on the ovary, which almost\r\nalways approaches one of the two surfaces; this surface is then called\r\nthe ventral.\r\n\r\nThe length of the Cestodes--independently of their age--depends on the\r\nnumber and size of the segments, as well as on their contraction; the\r\nsmallest species (_Davainea proglottina_) is 0·5 to 1·0 mm. in length;\r\nthe largest may attain a length of 10 m., and even more.\r\n\r\nThe entire superficial surface of the tapeworms is covered with a\r\nfairly resistant and elastic layer, which exhibits several indistinctly\r\nlimited layers and which is usually called a cuticle, which also covers\r\nthe suckers, and is reflected inwardly at the sexual orifices. In\r\nsome species fine hairs appear, either on the entire body or only in\r\nthe region of the neck, on the external surface. In the cuticle there\r\ncan be recognized, besides the pores, which no doubt are concerned\r\nwith nutrition, spaces in which lie the ends of sensory cells. Close\r\nunder the cuticle lies the external layer of the parenchyma (basal\r\nmembrane), and below this the circular and longitudinal muscles forming\r\nthe dermo-muscular coat. The matrix cells of the cuticle occur as in\r\nthe Trematodes, only on the inner side of the peripheral muscles in\r\nthe external zone of the parenchyma; they are fusiform cells, forming\r\none or two layers, but are not arranged in the manner of epithelial\r\ncells (fig. 184, _Sc.c._). They have fine branching processes which\r\nrun between the dermal muscles, pass through the basal membrane and\r\npenetrate the internal surface of the cuticle with small pistil-like\r\nenlargements, expanding on the internal surface of the cuticle into a\r\nthin plasma layer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 184.--Schematic representation of a small part of\r\na transverse section of _Ligula_ sp. _Bs._, basal membrane; _Cu._,\r\ncuticle; at its base are the endplates of the subcuticular (epithelial)\r\ncells; in the centre a cuticular sense organ, _O.s._; _F.v.s._,\r\nvitelline follicle; _Exc._, excretory vessel; _C._, calcareous\r\ncorpuscle; _L.m._, longitudinal muscles; _M.c._, myoblast; _P.m._,\r\nparenchymatous or dorso-ventral muscles; _Pl._, plexus of nerve fibres;\r\n_A.m._, circular muscles; _Sc.c._, subcuticular or matrix cell; _T.c._,\r\nterminal flame cell. 500/1. (After Blochmann.)]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above mentioned, there are other cuticular\r\nformations occurring on the cuticle of some Cestodes, such as immobile\r\nhairs and variously formed hooks, such as are seen principally on the\r\nscolex. Their development is only roughly known in a few species;\r\nthey are usually already present in the larval stage, and of the same\r\narrangement and shape as in the fully developed tapeworms; a matter\r\nof importance, because by these structures larvæ can be recognized as\r\nbeing those of a certain species of tapeworm.\r\n\r\nThe CUTICULAR GLANDS in Cestodes are scarce.\r\n\r\nThe PARENCHYMA forms the chief tissue of the entire body, and in all\r\nessentials its structure is similar to that of the Trematodes.\r\n\r\nThe same doubt exists here also as to the nature of the parenchyma.\r\nRecent authors consider that it consists of highly branched cells,\r\nthe processes of which ramify in all directions. These cells lie in a\r\nnon-cellular matrix containing fluid vacuoles. This matrix spreads in\r\nbetween and so breaks the continuity of the epidermal cells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 185.--Half of a transverse section through a\r\nproglottis of _Tænia crassicollis_. Cu., cuticle; _Ex.v._, external\r\nexcretory vessel, to the right of which there is the smaller internal\r\none; _T._, testicular vesicles; _L.m._, longitudinal muscles (outer\r\nand inner); _M.f._, lateral nerve with the two accessory nerves;\r\n_Sc.c._, subcuticular matrix cells; _Sm.f._, submedian nerve; _Tr.m._,\r\ntransverse muscles; _Ut._, the uterus, and the middle of the entire\r\ntransverse section. 44/1.]\r\n\r\nIn the parenchyma of almost all the Cestodes there are found in adult\r\nspecimens, as well as in larvæ, light-refracting concentrically\r\nstriated structures, of a spherical or broad elliptical shape, which,\r\non account of their containing carbonate of lime, are termed CALCAREOUS\r\nCORPUSCLES (fig. 184, _C._). Their size, between 3 µ and 30 µ, varies\r\naccording to the species; their frequency and distribution in the\r\nparenchyma also varies, but they are chiefly found in the cortical\r\nlayer. They are the product of certain parenchymatous cells, in the\r\ninterior of which they lie like a fat globule in a fat cell, but\r\naccording to others they are _intercellular_ in origin.\r\n\r\nThe MUSCULAR SYSTEM of the proglottids is composed of--(1) the\r\nsubcuticular muscles (figs. 184 and 185), as a rule consisting of\r\na single layer of annular muscles; (2) longitudinal muscles; (3)\r\ndorso-ventral fibres extending singly from one surface to the other,\r\nand at both ends expanding in a brush-like manner, and inserted into\r\nthe basal membrane, consisting of an outer, more numerous, and an\r\ninner, less numerous but more powerful layer (the number of bundles\r\nin this layer being in certain cases of specific importance); (4)\r\ntransverse fibres, the elements of which penetrate to the borders\r\nof the segments, thus passing through the longitudinal muscles and\r\nreaching the cuticle. In the region of the septa the transverse and\r\ndorso-ventral muscles form a kind of plate.\r\n\r\nThe mass of parenchyma bounded by the transverse muscles is termed\r\nthe MEDULLARY layer, while the mass lying outside them is termed the\r\nCORTICAL LAYER.\r\n\r\nIt was known long ago that the myoblasts adhere to the dorso-ventral\r\nfibres as thickenings, but it is only recently that large star-shaped\r\ncells (fig. 184), separated from but connected with them by processes,\r\nhave been recognized as the myoblasts of other fibres (Blochmann,\r\nZernecke).\r\n\r\nWithin the scolex the direction and course of the muscular layers\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nThe SUCKERS are parts of the musculature, locally transformed, with a\r\npowerful development of the dorso-ventral muscles, now become radial\r\nfibres.\r\n\r\nThe ROSTELLUM of the armed Tæniæ, like the proboscis of the\r\n_Rhynchobothriidæ_, also belongs to the same category of organs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 186.--_Dipylidium caninum_: from the cat. In the\r\nupper figure the rostellum is retracted, in the lower protruded, _a_,\r\nsucker; _b_, hooks of rostellum; _B_, enlarged hook; _c_, apical\r\naperture on scolex; _d_, longitudinal muscles; _e_, circular muscles.\r\n(After Benham.)]\r\n\r\nIn the simplest form, the rostellum, or top of the head (as in\r\n_Dipylidium caninum_), appears as a hollow oval sac, the anterior part\r\nof which, projecting beyond the upper surface of the head, carries\r\nseveral rows of hooks (fig. 186). The entire internal space of the sac\r\nis occupied by an elastic, slightly fibrous mass, while the anterior\r\nhalf of the surface of the rostellum is covered by longitudinal fibres\r\nand the posterior half by circular fibres. On contraction of the latter\r\nthe entire mass is protruded through the apical aperture, the surface\r\nof the rostellum becomes more arched, and the position of the hooks is,\r\nin consequence, altered. The rostellum of the large-hooked _Tæniidæ_,\r\nwhich inhabit the intestine of man and beasts of prey, is of a far more\r\ncomplicated structure, for, in addition to the somewhat lens-shaped\r\nrostellum carrying the hooks on its outer surface, there are secondary\r\nmuscles grouped in a cup-like manner (fig. 187). Every change in the\r\ncurvature of the surface of the rostellum induces an alteration in the\r\nposition of the hooks. In the hookless _Tæniidæ_ the muscular system of\r\nthe rostellum is altered in a very different manner; in a few forms a\r\ntypical sucker appears in its place.\r\n\r\nThe NERVOUS SYSTEM commences in the scolex and runs through the\r\nneck and the entire series of proglottids. Within the proglottids it\r\nconsists of a number of longitudinal nerve fibres of which those at\r\neach lateral border are usually the largest. In the Tæniæ the lateral\r\nnerves are accompanied both dorsally and ventrally by a thinner nerve\r\n(accessory nerve) (fig. 185); on each surface, moreover, between the\r\nlateral nerve and the median plane, there are two somewhat stronger\r\nbundles (sub-median), so that there is a total of ten longitudinal\r\nnerve bundles. They lie externally to the transverse muscle plates,\r\nand the lateral and accessory bundles lie externally to the principal\r\nexcretory vessels, and are everywhere connected by numerous anastomoses\r\nand secondary anastomoses; one typical ring commissure is usually found\r\nat the posterior border of the segments. In the _Bothriocephalidæ_ the\r\ndistribution of the nerve bundles is different (for instance, two lie\r\nin the medullary layer), or they are split up into a larger number\r\nof branches. In the scolex the nerve bundles are connected in a very\r\nremarkable manner by commissures with that which is generally termed\r\nthe central part of the entire nervous system. There occurs normally\r\na commissure between the two lateral nerves; at the same level, the\r\ndorsal and ventral median nerves are also connected at each surface as\r\nwell with each other as with the lateral nerves, so that a hexagonal or\r\noctagonal figure is formed. The so-called apical nerves pass from this\r\ncommissural system anteriorly, embrace the secondary muscular system of\r\nthe rostellum semicircularly, and form an annular commissure (rostellar\r\nring) at the inner part of the rostellum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 187.--Longitudinal section of the head and neck of\r\n_Tænia crassicollis_, showing the lens-shaped muscular rostellum, with\r\ntwo hooks lying in the concentric cup-like mass of muscles. _L.m._,\r\nlongitudinal muscles of the neck; _L.f._, left lateral nerve; _G._,\r\nganglion; _S.c._, subcuticular layer; _W_{1}_, external, _W_{2}_,\r\ninternal excretory vessel. 30/1.\r\n\r\nThe peripheral nerves arise from the nerve bundles as well as from the\r\ncommissures situated in the scolex; some go direct to the muscles,\r\nwhile others form a close plexus of nerves external to the inner\r\nlongitudinal muscles, which plexus likewise sends out fibres to the\r\nmuscles, but principally to numerous fusiform sense organs (fig. 184,\r\n_Pl._); they lie internal to the subcuticular cells and, piercing the\r\ncuticle with their peripheral processes, end as projecting “receptor”\r\nhairs. Higher organs of sense are not known.\r\n\r\nThe EXCRETORY APPARATUS of the Cestodes is similar to that of other\r\nflat worms. The terminal (flame) cells, which hardly differ in\r\nappearance from those of the Trematodes, are distributed throughout\r\nthe parenchyma, but are more common in the cortical than in the\r\nmedullary layer (fig. 184, _T.c._). Before opening into a collecting\r\ntube, the capillaries run straight, tortuously, or in convolutions,\r\nanastomosing frequently with one another or forming a _rete mirabile_.\r\nThe collecting tubes, which have their own epithelial and cuticular\r\nwall, and which also appear to be provided with muscular fibres, occur\r\ntypically as four canals passing through the entire length of the worm\r\n(fig. 189); they lie side by side, two (a wider thin-walled ventral,\r\nand a narrower thick-walled dorsal one) in either lateral field; in\r\nthe head the two vessels on each side unite by means of a loop, at\r\nthe posterior extremity they open into a short pyriform or fusiform\r\nterminal bladder which discharges in the middle of the posterior edge\r\nof the original terminal proglottis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 188.--_Tænia cœnurus_, head and part of neck\r\nshowing nervous system. Enlarged. (After Niemiec.)]\r\n\r\nThis primitive type (fig. 189) of arrangement of collective tubes is\r\nsubject to variation in most Cestodes, in the scolex as well as in\r\nthe segments. Indeed, even the lumen of the four longitudinal tubes\r\ndoes not remain equal, as the dorsal or external tubes are more fully\r\ndeveloped and become thicker, whereas the ventral or internal ones\r\nremain thin, and in some species quite disappear in the older segments\r\n(figs. 185, 187). Moreover, very frequently connections are established\r\nbetween the right and left longitudinal branches, as in the head,\r\nwhere a “frontal anastomosis” develops, which in the _Tæniidæ_ usually\r\ntakes the form of a ring encircling the rostellum (fig. 190), and in\r\nthe segments of a transverse anastomosis at each posterior border,\r\nespecially between the larger branches, and more rarely between the\r\nsmaller collecting tubes also (fig. 191).\r\n\r\nThe so-called “island” formation is another modification, _i.e._, at\r\nany spot a vessel may divide and after a longer or shorter course the\r\ntwo branches reunite, and this may appear in the collecting tubes\r\nthemselves as well as in their anastomoses. The above-mentioned ring\r\nin the frontal commissure of the _Tæniidæ_ is such an island; similar\r\nrings also frequently encircle the suckers (fig. 190). In extreme cases\r\n(_Triænophorus_, _Ligula_, _Dibothriocephalus_, etc.) this island\r\nformation extends to all the collecting tubes and their anastomoses.\r\nInstead of two or four longitudinal canals only, connected by\r\ntransverse anastomoses at the posterior border of the segments, there\r\nis an irregular network of vessels, situated in the cortical layer,\r\nfrom which the longitudinal branches, having again subdivided, can only\r\nbe distinguished at intervals, and even then not in their usual number.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 189.--Young _Acanthobothrium coronatum_, v.\r\nBen., with the excretory vessels outlined. Slightly enlarged. (After\r\nPintner.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 190.--Scolex of a cysticercoid from _Arion sp._,\r\nwith the excretory vessels outlined. (After Pintner.)]\r\n\r\nThe opening of the longitudinal branches at the posterior end requires\r\nmore accurate investigation; it is true that a single terminal\r\nbladder is mentioned as being present in many species, but this is\r\nalso disputed; when the original end proglottis has been cast off,\r\nthe longitudinal branches discharge separately. Some species possess\r\nthe so-called foramina secundaria, which serve as outlets for the\r\ncollecting tubes; they are generally at the neck, but may be situated\r\non the segments.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the excretory vessels is a clear fluid, the\r\nregurgitation of which is prevented by the valves present at the points\r\nof origin of the transverse anastomoses. The fluid contains in solution\r\na substance similar to guanine and xanthine.\r\n\r\n_Genital Organs._--With the exception of one genus (_Diœcocestus_,\r\nFuhrm.), in which the species are sexually differentiated, all the\r\nCestodes are hermaphroditic; the genitalia develop gradually in the\r\nsegments (never in the scolex), the male organs, as is usual in\r\nhermaphroditic animals, forming earlier than the female. The youngest\r\nproglottids generally do not exhibit even traces of genitalia: these,\r\nas a rule, develop first in the older segments, and the development\r\nproceeds onwards from segment to segment. In a few exceptional cases\r\n(_Ligula_) the sexual organs are already developed in the larval stage,\r\nbut are only functional after the entry of the parasite into the final\r\nhost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 191.--Proglottis of _Tænia saginata_, Goeze,\r\nshowing genitalia. _C._, transverse excretory canal; _N._, lateral\r\nlongitudinal nerve; _W._, longitudinal excretory canal; _T._, testicles\r\nscattered throughout the proglottis; _Ut._, opposite the central\r\nuterine stem (a closed sac); _Ss._, genital pore leading into the\r\ngenital sinus; above the cirrus and coiled vas deferens (_V.d._), below\r\nthe vagina (_Vag._), bearing near its termination a dilatation, the\r\nseminal receptacle; _Vsc._, the triangular vitellarium, and above it\r\n(_Shg._) the shell gland; leading from this to the uterus is seen the\r\nshort uterine canal, on either side of this the two lobes of the ovary\r\n(_Ov._). 10/1.]\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the end portions of the vagina, cirrus and\r\nuterus, all the parts of the genital apparatus lie in the medullary\r\nlayer, except only the vitellaria, which in many species are in the\r\ncortical layer. The male apparatus consists of the testes, of which,\r\nas a rule, there are a large number,[278] and which lie dorsal to the\r\nmedian plane (fig. 185, _T._); a vas efferens arises from each testis,\r\nunites with contiguous vasa, and finally discharges into the muscular\r\nvas deferens that is situated in about the middle of the segment.\r\nAccording to the position of the genital pore, the vas deferens opens\r\non the lateral margin or in the middle line in the front of the\r\nsegment; it is much convoluted or twisted, and frequently possesses a\r\ndilatation termed the vesicula seminalis. It finally enters the cirrus\r\npouch, which is usually elongated; within the cirrus pouch lies the\r\nprotrusible cirrus, which is not uncommonly provided with hooklets.\r\n\r\n[278] There are, however, tapeworms with only one, others with only two\r\nor three testes in each segment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 192.--_Dibothriocephalus latus._ Upper figure:\r\nfemale genitalia, ventral view.

(After Benham and Sommer\r\nand Landois.)]\r\n\r\nThe male sexual orifice almost always opens with that of the vagina\r\ninto a genital atrium, the raised border of which rises above the edge\r\nof the segment and forms the genital papilla (fig. 191).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 193.--Diagram of genitalia of a Cestode. _g.p._,\r\ngenital pore; ♀ ♂, male and female ducts opening into genital sinus;\r\n_c.s._, cirrus sac; _v.d._, coiled vas deferens (“outer seminal\r\nvesicle”); _vag._, vagina; _sem. rec._, seminal receptacle; _sp. d._,\r\nspermatic duct; _C.c._, fertilization canal; _vit. d._, vitelline duct;\r\n_sh. g._, shell gland; _ut. c._, uterine canal; _ut._, uterus; _Ov._,\r\novary; _p_, pumping organ. _Cf._ figs. 191 and 233. (Stephens.)]\r\n\r\nThe vagina, like the vas deferens, usually runs inwardly and\r\nposteriorly, where it forms a spindle-shaped dilatation (receptaculum\r\nseminis); its continuation, the spermatic duct, unites with the\r\noviduct, the common duct of the ovaries (fig. 191). The ovaries,\r\nusually two in number, are compound tubular glands in the posterior\r\nhalf of the proglottis, which extend into the medullary layer, but\r\nventral to the median plane.\r\n\r\nAt the origin of the oviduct there is frequently a dilatation provided\r\nwith circular muscles (suction apparatus), which receives the ovarian\r\ncells and propels them forward. After the oviduct has received the\r\nspermatic duct the canal proceeds as the fertilization canal, and after\r\na very short course receives the vitelline duct or ducts, and then the\r\nnumerous ducts of the shell glands (oötype). [Although the nomenclature\r\nof these parts varies, we may consider the oviduct as extending from\r\nthe ovary to the shell gland and as receiving the spermatic duct and\r\nthen the vitelline duct and the ducts of the shell gland. The short\r\npiece into which the shell gland ducts open corresponds to the oötype\r\nin the flukes, but in the tapeworms this portion of the canal is seldom\r\ndilated. From this point the oviduct is continued as a shorter or\r\nlonger tube, the uterine canal or true oviduct opening into the uterus\r\nproper.--J. W. W. S.] The vitellarium may be single, but often exhibits\r\nits primitive duplication more or less distinctly, in which case it is\r\nsituated at the posterior border of the segments in the medullary layer\r\n(fig. 191). The original position of the double organ is, moreover, the\r\nsame as in the Trematodes, _i.e._, at the sides of the proglottids, and\r\nthence eventually extending more or less on both surfaces (figs. 192\r\nand 194); the gland is then distinctly grape-like and the follicles lie\r\nmostly in the cortical layer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 194.--Part of a transverse section through a\r\nproglottis of _Dibothriocephalus latus_. _Ct._, cuticle; _C._,\r\ncirrus; _Vvs._, vitelline follicles; _L.M._, longitudinal muscles;\r\n_T._, testicles; _M._, medullary nerve; _S.c._, subcuticle; _T.m._,\r\ntransverse muscles; _Ut._, uterus. 20/1.]\r\n\r\nThe egg cell that has been fertilized and supplied with yolk cells\r\nreceives the shell material at the point of entry of the shell gland\r\nducts, and, as a complete egg, then moves onward to the uterus. In\r\nthose cases in which the uterus in its further course presents a\r\nconvoluted canal, and may form a rosette (pseudo-phyllidea), there is\r\nan external opening which is usually separate from the genital pore,\r\nand lies on the same or the opposite surface. In all other cases,\r\nhowever, the uterus terminates blindly and is represented by a longer\r\nor shorter sac lying in the longitudinal axis (fig. 191), but in many\r\nforms transversely. With the accumulation of eggs it becomes modified\r\nin various ways: (1) it sends out lateral branches (fig. 241), or\r\n(2) forms numerous isolated sacs (PARENCHYMAL CAPSULES) containing\r\nsingle eggs or groups of eggs (fig. 217); further, (3) in some cases\r\nat the blind end one or more special thick-walled cavities are formed\r\n(PARUTERINE ORGANS or UTERINE CAPSULES), in which all or most of the\r\neggs are collected, the uterus then undergoing atrophy.\r\n\r\nIn species in which the uterus lacks an opening, simultaneously with\r\nthe growth of this organ an atrophy of the male apparatus, at least\r\nof the testes and their excretory ducts, takes place; this atrophy\r\nalso frequently occurs in the female glands, so that the entire mature\r\nsegments have besides the uterus only traces of the genitalia left.\r\n\r\nIn the _Acoleïnæ_ the vagina is more or less extensively atrophied, and\r\nin any case has no external opening.\r\n\r\nA number of genera are distinguished by the duplication of the\r\ngenitalia in every segment; the genital apparatus in its entirety, or\r\nwith the exception of the uterus, is double, or the genital glands and\r\nthe uterus are single, but the cirrus, vas deferens and vagina are\r\ndouble.\r\n\r\nOn comparing the genitalia of the Trematodes and Cestodes the parts\r\nwill be found to agree, but the vagina of the Cestodes corresponds\r\nwith the uterus of the Trematodes, and the uterus of the tapeworms to\r\nLaurer’s canal of the Trematodes, which in most of the Cestodes has\r\nlost its external orifice.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF THE TAPEWORMS.\r\n\r\n_Copulation._--As each proglottis possesses its own genital apparatus,\r\nand male as well as female organs are present, the following processes\r\nmay occur: (1) self- or auto-fecundation (without immissio cirri); (2)\r\nself- or auto-copulation (with immissio cirri); (3) cross-copulation\r\nbetween proglottids of the same or different chains (of the same\r\nspecies); and (4) cross-copulation in the same proglottis in species\r\nwith double genital pores. These various modes have actually been\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nIn those species which lack the vagina (_Acoleïnæ_) it appears that\r\nthe cirri, which are always furnished with hooks, are driven into the\r\ntissues and for the most part reach the receptaculum seminis.\r\n\r\nThe _eggs_ of all Cestodes are provided with shells, but the shells,\r\nlike their contents, vary. In genera that possess a uterine pore the\r\nmature eggs frequently do not differ from those of the Distomata; they\r\nhave a brown or yellow shell of oval form provided with an operculum,\r\nand contain a number of yolk cells in addition to the fertilized\r\novarian cell (fig. 128), but in other genera (with a uterine pore) the\r\nlid is absent and the egg-shell is very thin, the eggs of these genera\r\nresembling those of Cestodes in which the secretion of the vitellarium\r\nis a light albumin-like substance that contains only a few granules,\r\nand in which the egg-shell is very delicate and without operculum.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of _Tæniidæ_, for example, at first consist of egg-shell\r\n(oötype), ovum and yolk cells. The egg-shell is as a rule soft,\r\ncolourless and frequently deciduous, and the yolk is scanty in amount\r\nand contains few granules. The eggs are, moreover, more complicated\r\nthan this. They enlarge and change their shape and various envelopes\r\nare developed around the embryo. The egg-shell proper often disappears,\r\nand one or more embryonal envelopes, or protoplasmic layers, arise,\r\nso that eventually it is difficult to say whether the whole egg is\r\npresent, and, if not, what the layers that remain really are.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 195.--Egg of _Diplogonoporus grandis_, showing the\r\nmorula surrounded by yolk cells and granules. 440/1. (After Kurimoto.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 196.--Uterine egg of _Tænia saginata_, G. Uterine\r\nshell with filaments; the oncosphere with embryonal shell (embryophore)\r\nin the centre. 500/1. (After Leuckart.)]\r\n\r\nThe _embryonal development_ in most species takes place during the stay\r\nof the eggs in the uterus; in other species it takes place after the\r\neggs have been deposited and are in water. Separate cells or a layer\r\nof cells always separate from the segmentation cells, as well as from\r\nthe cells of the developing embryo, and form one or more envelopes\r\nround the embryo; usually two such envelopes are formed, the inner\r\none of which stands in intimate relationship with the embryo itself\r\nand is often erroneously termed the egg-shell, but more correctly the\r\nembryonal shell or _embryophore_. In some species it carries long\r\ncilia, as in _Dibothriocephalus latus_, by aid of which the young swim\r\nabout when released from the egg-shell; as a general rule, however,\r\nthere are no cilia and this envelope is homogeneous, or is composed\r\nof numerous rods and is calcified, as in _Tænia_ spp. (fig. 197). The\r\nsecond outer envelope (“yolk envelope”) (fig. 207, 3) lies close within\r\nthe true (oötype) egg-shell, and remains within it when the embryo\r\nhatches out, and in many species, as in _Tænia_ spp., it perishes at\r\nthe end of the embryonal development with the delicate egg-shell which\r\nwas formed in the oötype, so that one observes not the entire egg with\r\negg-shell but only the embryo in its embryonal shell, _viz._, the\r\nembryophore (fig. 197, _a._).\r\n\r\nThe embryo (the ONCOSPHERE) enclosed within the embryonal shell\r\n(embryophore) is of spheroidal or ovoid form (fig. 197, _b._), and\r\nis distinguished by the possession of three pairs of spines, a few\r\nterminal (flame) cells of the excretory system, and muscles to move the\r\nspines.\r\n\r\nNO FURTHER DEVELOPMENT of the oncosphere takes place, either in the\r\nparent organism or in the open; in fact, in all cases in which the\r\noncospheres are already formed within the proglottids they do not\r\nbecome free, but remain in their shell; it is only when the oncospheres\r\nare provided with a ciliated embryophore that they leave the egg-shell,\r\nand they even cast this ciliated envelope after having swum about in\r\nwater by its means for a week or so. Sooner or later, however, all the\r\noncospheres leave the host that harbours the parental tapeworm and\r\nreach the open, either still enclosed in the uterus of the evacuated\r\nproglottids, after the disintegration of which they then become free,\r\nor after being deposited as eggs in the intestine of the host; they\r\nthen leave it with the fæces. In the former case also, the slightest\r\ninjury to the mature proglottids while still in the intestine suffices\r\nto allow a part of the oncospheres in their embryophores to be released\r\nand mingled with the fæces. Here they are the generally, but falsely,\r\nso-called Tæniæ “eggs.” For, as stated above, the “yolk” envelope and\r\nthe true shell deposited in the oötype have before this disintegrated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 197.--_a._, oncosphere, in its radially striated\r\nembryophore (erroneously termed egg-shell) of _Tænia africana_. Greatly\r\nmagnified. (After von Linstow.) _b._, freed oncosphere of _Dipylidium\r\ncaninum_. (After Grassi and Rovelli.) Both oncospheres show six spines.]\r\n\r\nIn other cases, _e.g._, _Hymenolepis_ spp., the uterine (oötype) shell\r\npersists in fæces (fig. 230).\r\n\r\nIn any case the oncospheres must be transmitted into suitable animals\r\nto effect their further development; in only very rare cases might\r\nan active invasion be possible, as, for instance, takes place with\r\nthe miracidia of many Trematodes. The entry into an animal is, as a\r\nrule, entirely passive, that is to say, the oncospheres are swallowed\r\nwith the food or water. Many animals are coprophagous and ingest the\r\noncospheres direct with the fæces; others swallow them with water,\r\nmud, or food contaminated by such fæces. Infection is easily produced\r\nartificially by feeding suitable animals with mature proglottids of\r\ncertain Cestodes or introducing the oncospheres with the food. As\r\nthe mature tapeworm frequently finds the conditions suitable for\r\nits development in only one species of host, or in species nearly\r\nrelated, and perishes when artificially introduced into other hosts,\r\nexperiment has taught us that to succeed in cultivating the oncospheres\r\ncertain species of animals are necessary. Thus we are aware that the\r\noncospheres of _Tænia solium_, which lives in the intestine of man,\r\ndevelop only in the pig, and only quite exceptionally develop into the\r\nstage characteristic of all Cestodes--the cysticercus in the wide sense\r\nof the word--in a few other mammals. The oncospheres of _T. saginata_\r\ndevelop further only in the ox; those of _T. marginata_ (of the dog) in\r\nthe pig, goat, and sheep; those of _T. serrata_ (of the dog) in hares\r\nand rabbits; those of _Dipylidium caninum_ (of the dog and cat) in\r\nparasitic insects of the dog and cat, etc. It is not unusual that young\r\nanimals only appear to be capable of infection, while older animals of\r\nthe same species are not so.\r\n\r\nOnce introduced into a suitable animal, which is only exceptionally\r\nthe same individual or belongs to the same species as the one which\r\nharbours the adult tapeworm, the oncosphere passes into the larval\r\nstage common to all Cestodes, but varying in structure according to the\r\nspecies. In the simplest case--as, _e.g._, in _Dibothriocephalus_--such\r\na larva resembles the scolex of the corresponding tapeworm, only that\r\nthe head, provided with suckers, is retracted within the fore-part of\r\nthe neck. Such a larval form is known as a _plerocercoid_ (πλήερης,\r\nfull; κέρκος, tail). They differ from the cysticercoids in being solid\r\nlarval forms, elongated, tape-like or oval, with the head invaginated.\r\nThe conditions appear to be similar in _Ligula_, _Schistocephalus_,\r\n_Triænophorus_, but here the larvæ are very large, indeed as large in\r\nthe first-mentioned genera as the tapeworms originating from them,\r\nand the sexual organs are already outlined; doubtless, however, this\r\nstage is preceded by one that corresponds to the scolex of the genus in\r\nquestion, and which represents the actual larval stage. In such cases\r\nthe development of the body of the tapeworm from the scolex has already\r\nbegun within the first or intermediate host; in other cases, except in\r\nthe single-jointed (monozootic) Cestodes, this only takes place in the\r\ndefinitive host. The direct metamorphosis of the oncosphere into the\r\nlarval forms termed PLEROCERCOID has hitherto not been investigated,\r\nalthough _Ligula_, _Schistocephalus_ and _Bothriocephalus_ are very\r\ncommon parasites, but many circumstances point to the conclusions\r\narrived at by us and by other observers. In the larval stages of other\r\ntapeworms we can always distinguish the scolex and a caudal-like\r\nappendage, vesicular in the cysticerci (fig. 200), compact in the\r\ncysticercoids (fig. 231). The scolex alone forms the future tapeworm,\r\nthe variously formed appendage perishing.\r\n\r\nIt has now been proved that the appendage, the caudal vesicle,\r\noriginates direct from the body of the oncosphere, and therefore\r\nis primary, and that the scolex only subsequently forms through\r\nproliferation on the surface of this appendage. On account of this\r\norigin the scolex is generally regarded as the daughter, and the part\r\nusually designated as the appendage as the mother, originating from the\r\noncosphere.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, two modes of development of the larval stage may be\r\ndistinguished; in the one case, plerocerci and plerocercoids, the\r\noncosphere changes directly into the scolex, thus forming the body of\r\nthe tapeworm within the primary host; in the other case, cysticerci and\r\ncysticercoids, the scolex only forms secondarily in the transformed\r\nbody of the oncosphere, which later on perishes, the scolex alone\r\nremaining as the originator of the tapeworm colony.\r\n\r\nWe may summarize briefly what has been said regarding these larval\r\nforms. We have, firstly, solid larval forms without any bladder. These\r\narise _directly_ from the oncosphere and are of two kinds, plerocercus\r\nand plerocercoid. _Plerocercus_ is a solid _globular_ larva with the\r\nhead invaginated into the posterior portion. _Plerocercoid_ (fig. 208)\r\nis a solid _elongated_ larva also with the head invaginated into\r\nthe posterior portion, which is sometimes very long. Secondly, we\r\nhave larval forms with bladders from which the scolices arise thus\r\n_indirectly_ from the oncosphere. They are of two kinds, cysticercoid\r\nand cysticercus.\r\n\r\n_Cysticercoid._--The bladder is but slightly developed and is usually\r\nabsorbed again. The anterior portion is, moreover, retracted into\r\nthe posterior, and in some cases there is a long or a stumpy tail\r\n(figs. 220, 231).\r\n\r\n_Cysticercus_, or true bladder worms. (These may be divided into\r\n(1) cysticercus proper, consisting of a bladder and one scolex; (2)\r\ncœnurus, a bladder and many scolices; (3) echinococcus, a bladder in\r\nwhich daughter bladders or cysts are developed, and then in these\r\nmultiple scolices.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 198.--Diagram of a cysticercoid. _Cf._ figs. 220,\r\n227. _c.v._, caudal vesicle or bladder (small); _sec. c._, secondary\r\ncavity caused by the growth forward of the hind-body; _t._, tail\r\nbearing six spines. (Stephens.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 199.--Diagram of a cysticercus. _c.v._, caudal\r\nvesicle or bladder; _i._, invagination of wall of bladder. (Stephens.)]\r\n\r\nIn the case of cysticerci a papilliform invagination forms, projecting\r\ninto the interior of the bladder (fig. 201). The layer of cells forming\r\nthe papilla becomes divided into two laminæ, the outer[279] of which\r\nforms a kind of investing membrane (receptaculum capitis) for the\r\npapilla. The head and suckers are now developed on the walls bounding\r\nthe axial lumen of the papilla. The papilla eventually evaginates, so\r\nthat the receptaculum capitis now forms the inner surface of the hollow\r\nhead, which eventually becomes solid.\r\n\r\n[279] _I.e._, regarded from the interior or centre of the invagination.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of the development of cysticerci in the wide sense of\r\nthe word is limited almost exclusively to that of a few true “bladder\r\nworms” (cysticerci); in other cases we know either only the terminal\r\nstage, _i.e._, the complete larva, or, exceptionally, one of the\r\nintermediate stages, but we are not acquainted with a complete series;\r\nthe description must therefore be incomplete.\r\n\r\nWe know from feeding experiments that, after the introduction of mature\r\nproglottids or of the fully developed ova of _Tænia crassicollis_ (of\r\nthe cat) into the stomach of mice, the oncospheres escape from the\r\nshell in the middle portion of the small intestine, and a few hours\r\nlater penetrate into the intestinal wall by means of a boring movement;\r\nthey have been found in this position twenty-seven to thirty hours\r\nafter the infection. By means of this migration, for which purpose they\r\nemploy their spines, they attain the blood-vessels of the intestine;\r\nindeed, already nine hours after the infection and later they are found\r\nin the blood of the portal vein, and in the course of the second day\r\nafter infection they are found in the capillaries of the liver, which\r\nthese larvæ do not leave.\r\n\r\nLeuckart, in experimental feeding of rabbits with oncospheres of\r\n_Tænia serrata_ (of the dog), found free oncospheres in the stomach of\r\nthe experimental animal, but not in the intestine: however, he came\r\nacross them again in the blood of the portal vein. The passage through\r\nthe blood-vessels to the liver is the normal one for those species\r\nof _Tænia_ the eggs of which become larvae in mammals; even in those\r\ncases in which the oncospheres develop further in the omentum or in\r\nthe abdominal cavity (_Cysticercus tenuicollis_, _C. pisiformis_),\r\nthere are distinct changes observable in the liver that lead one to the\r\nconclusion that there has been a secondary migration out of the liver\r\ninto the abdominal cavity. Indeed, one must not imagine that the young\r\nstages of the Cestodes are absolutely passive; once they have invaded\r\nan organ they travel actively, and leave distinct traces of their\r\npassage.\r\n\r\nIn other cases the oncospheres leave the liver with the circulation,\r\nand are thus distributed further in the body; they may settle and\r\ndevelop in one or more organs or tissues. Many oncospheres may, by\r\ntravelling through the intestinal wall, penetrate through it and\r\nattain the abdominal cavity direct; some, perhaps, pass also into the\r\nlymph stream. Where there are no blood and lymphatic vessels in the\r\nintestinal wall, as in insects, the oncospheres attain the body cavity\r\nor its organs direct; in short, they never remain in the intestinal\r\nlumen itself, and only rarely--as in _Hymenolepis murina_ of the\r\nrat--do they remain in the intestinal wall.\r\n\r\n  When the infection has been intense, and the body is crowded with\r\n  numerous oncospheres, acute feverish symptoms, are induced, to which\r\n  the infected animals usually succumb (“acute cestode tuberculosis”);\r\n  while in other cases the alterations in the organs attacked--as the\r\n  liver in mice and the brain in sheep--may cause death.\r\n\r\nSooner or later the oncospheres of tapeworms come to rest, and are\r\nfirst transformed into a bladder, which may be round or oval according\r\nto the species. The embryonal spines disappear sooner or later, or\r\nremain close together or spread over some part of the bladder wall\r\n(fig. 200). Their discovery by V. Stein in the bladder worm of the\r\n“meal worm” (the larva of a beetle, _Tenebrio molitor_) first led to\r\nthe conclusion that bladder worms (cysticerci) actually originate from\r\nthe oncospheres of _Tæniidæ_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 200.--Diagram of development of a cysticercus. 1,\r\nsolid oncosphere with six spines; 2, bladder formed by liquefaction of\r\ncontents; 3, invagination of bladder wall; 4, formation of rostellum\r\n(with hooklets) and suckers at the bottom of the invagination; 5,\r\nevagination of head; 6, complete evagination effected by pressure.\r\n(Stephens.)]\r\n\r\nThe bladder may remain as a bladder, and then by proliferation the\r\nscolex forms on its wall (fig. 202), or it may divide into an anterior\r\nso-called “cystic” portion and a solid tail-like appendage of various\r\nlengths, on which the embryonal hooks are to be found, and this is\r\nparticularly the case in those larval forms (cysticercoids), _e.g._,\r\nthose of _Dipylidium caninum_, that develop in invertebrate animals,\r\nsuch as Arthropoda.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above one may regard the scolex as an individual that\r\noriginates through proliferation of the wall of the parent cyst, mostly\r\nsingly, but in those cysticerci that are termed cœnurus (fig. 201)\r\nmany scolices occur, whereas in those called echinococcus the parent\r\ncyst originating from the oncosphere of _Tænia echinococcus_ (of the\r\ndog) first produces a number of daughter cysts, which in their turn\r\nform numerous scolices. Echinococcus-like conditions also occur in\r\ncysticercoids, as, for instance, in those peculiar to earthworms; and\r\nsimilar conditions prevail in a larval form known as _Staphylocystis_,\r\nfound in the wood-louse (_Glomeris_). Thus it happens in these cases\r\nthat finally _one_ tapeworm egg produces not _one_, but numerous\r\ntapeworms, for, under favourable conditions, each scolex can form a\r\ntapeworm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 201.--Section through a piece of a _Cœnurus\r\ncerebralis_, with four cephalic invaginations in different stages of\r\ndevelopment. At the bottom of the invaginations the rostellum, hooks\r\nand suckers develop. (From a wax model.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 202.--Median section through a cysticercus, with\r\ndeveloped scolex at the bottom of the invagination. (After Leuckart.)]\r\n\r\n  The rudiment of the scolex appears as a hollow bud, the cephalic\r\n  invagination usually directed towards the interior of the bladder\r\n  cavity; on its invaginated surface arise the four suckers, and the\r\n  rostellum with the hook apparatus is formed in its blind end; we\r\n  thus get a Tænia head, but with the position of the parts reversed\r\n  (fig. 201). In many cysticerci the head rises up from the base of the\r\n  cephalic invagination and is then surrounded by the latter. A more\r\n  or less elongated piece of neck also develops, and even proglottids\r\n  may appear, as in _Cysticercus fasciolaris_ (the larva of _Tænia\r\n  crassicollis_ of the cat) of the Muridæ, a process somewhat analogous\r\n  to that of Ligula, etc.\r\n\r\nThe period that elapses from the time of infection till the cysticercus\r\nis fully developed varies according to the species; the cysticercus of\r\n_Tænia saginata_ requires twenty-eight weeks, that of _T. marginata_\r\nseven to eight weeks, that of _T. solium_ three to four months, and\r\nthat of _T. echinococcus_ longer still.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 203.--_Cysticercus pisiformis_ in an evaginated\r\ncondition, with neck, fore-body and bladder, with excretory network in\r\nits wall. 18/1.]\r\n\r\nWith one single exception (_Archigetes_) the larvæ do not become\r\nsexually mature in the organ where they have developed; they must\r\nenter the terminal host, a matter that is usually purely passive, the\r\ncarriers of the larvæ or infected parts of them being usually devoured\r\nby other animals. In this manner, for instance, the larvæ (_Cysticercus\r\nfasciolaris_) found in mice and rats reach the intestine of cats;\r\nthose of the hare and rabbit (_C. pisiformis_) reach the intestine\r\nof dogs; those of the pig (_C. cellulosæ_) are introduced into man;\r\nthose of insects are swallowed by insectivorous birds; those of\r\ncrustaceans are ingested by ducks and other water fowl; perhaps, also,\r\nthe infection of herbivorous mammals is caused by their accidentally\r\nswallowing smaller creatures infected by larvæ. Indeed, the researches\r\nof Grassi and Rovelli have taught us that such an intermediate host\r\nis not always necessary; _Hymenolepis murina_ of rats and mice in its\r\nlarval stage lives in the intestinal wall of these rodents, and as a\r\nlarva it passes into the intestinal lumen and develops into a tapeworm\r\nin exactly the same way as the larvæ of other species that reach the\r\nintestine of the terminal host by means of an intermediate carrier.\r\nProbably this curtailed manner of transmission also occurs in many\r\nother species. In some cases the larvæ actively quit the body of the\r\nintermediate host, as in the case of _Ligula_ and _Schistocephalus_,\r\nwhich travel out of the body cavity of infected fish and reach the\r\nwater, where they may be observed in hundreds in summer, at all events\r\nin some localities. The larval stage of _Calliobothrium_--wrongly\r\ntermed _Scolex_--has been observed swimming free in the sea, and\r\nthe scolices of _Rhynchobothrium_, without their mother cysts, have\r\nbeen observed free within the tissues of several marine animals.\r\nIn any case there is almost always a change of hosts, even in the\r\nsingle-jointed Cestodes, for the larva of _Caryophyllæus_, which lives\r\nin fishes of the carp family, is found in limicoline Oligochætes,\r\nthat of _Gyrocotyle_ (Chimæra) in shell-fish (Mactra), and different\r\nconditions can hardly be possible for _Amphilina_. _Archigetes_ alone\r\nbecomes sexually mature in the larval stage, but the life-history of\r\nthis creature is not well known, so that it is not impossible that the\r\nattainment of sexual maturity as a larva in invertebrates (Oligochætes)\r\nis perhaps abnormal, and somewhat analogous to the maturity of some\r\nencysted Trematodes.\r\n\r\nThe METAMORPHOSIS OF THE LARVA into the tapeworm is rarely accomplished\r\nin a simple manner; the transformation, however, is not complex in\r\nthe single-jointed Cestodes, nor in _Ligula_ and _Schistocephalus_;\r\nthe latter is swallowed by birds (_Mergus_, _Anas_, etc.), produces\r\neggs after only a few days, and very soon quits the intestine of\r\nits terminal host. In all other cases it is the scolex only which,\r\nby proliferating at its posterior extremity, forms the proglottids,\r\nafter having invaded as a larva the intestine of a suitable host.\r\nThe mother cysts, or what corresponds to them, die, are digested,\r\nabsorbed, or perhaps even eliminated; on the contrary, segments found\r\non the scolex during the larval stage, also in the case of _Cysticercus\r\nfasciolaris_, are retained. It is not certain whether the larvæ of\r\n_Dibothriocephalus_ lose any part.\r\n\r\nThe time required by the scolex to complete the entire chain of\r\nproglottids does not depend only on the number it has to produce,\r\nfor _Tænia echinococcus_, which, as a rule, only possesses three or\r\nfour segments, takes quite as long a time for their growth (eleven to\r\ntwelve weeks) as _T. solium_ with its numerous segments; _T. cœnurus_\r\nis fully developed in three to four weeks, and the same holds good for\r\n_Dibothriocephalus latus_, which possesses many more segments than the\r\nabove-mentioned Tænia of the dog. In a number of species it has been\r\npossible to determine fairly accurately the average daily growth; for\r\ninstance, in _Dibothriocephalus latus_ the daily growth is 8 cm., in\r\n_Tænia saginata_ 7 cm., etc.\r\n\r\nThe history of the development of the Cestodes demonstrates that\r\npersons and beasts harbouring larval tapeworms have become infected by\r\nhaving swallowed the oncospheres of the species of tapeworm to which\r\nthey belong. In regard to _Hymenolepis murina_ alone, it is known that\r\nthe introduction of the oncospheres into those species of animals which\r\nharbour the adult tapeworm leads to the formation of the latter after\r\nthe development of a larval stage in the intestinal wall; nevertheless,\r\nonly young animals (rats) are capable of infection, for a previous\r\ninfection, or the presence of mature tapeworms in the intestine,\r\nappears to produce a kind of immunity.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIOLOGY.\r\n\r\nIn their adult stage, the tapeworms inhabit almost exclusively the\r\nalimentary canal of vertebrate animals, with but few exceptions the\r\nsmall intestine, and a few species select definite parts of it. A small\r\nnumber of _Rhynchobothriidæ_ of marine fishes live apparently always\r\nin the stomach, while in rays and sharks the spiral intestine is their\r\nexclusive site. Bothriocephali generally attach themselves with their\r\nhead on to the appendices of the pylorus of fishes; other species\r\n(_Hymenolepis diminuta_) occasionally fix their head in the ductus\r\ncholedochus, and this is more frequent still in the tapeworms of the\r\nrock badger (_Hyrax_), which occasionally penetrate entirely into the\r\nbiliary ducts. _Stilesia hepatica_, Wolffh., has so far only been found\r\nin the bile-ducts of its host (sheep and goat, East Africa).\r\n\r\nIn the disease of sheep induced by Cestodes, the worms have been\r\nobserved also in the pancreas. Specimens found in the large intestines\r\nwere probably being evacuated.\r\n\r\nThe Cestodes are looked upon as fairly inert creatures, this opinion\r\nhaving been formed by observing their condition in the cold cadavers of\r\nwarm-blooded animals. Actually, however, they are exceedingly active,\r\nand accomplish local movements within the intestine, for they have been\r\nfound in the ducts communicating with the bowel, or in the stomach,\r\nand may even make their way forward into the œsophagus.\r\n\r\nThey also invade other abdominal organs through abnormal\r\ncommunications, or through any that may be temporarily open between the\r\nintestine and such organs; they thus reach the abdominal cavity or the\r\nurinary bladder, or they work their way through the peritoneum.\r\n\r\nThey produce changes in the intestinal mucous membrane at the place of\r\ntheir attachment, the alterations varying in intensity according to the\r\nstructure of the fixation organs. The mucous membrane is elevated in\r\nknob-like areas by the suckers; the epithelial cells become atrophied\r\nor may be entirely obliterated. _Dipylidium caninum_ bores into the\r\nopenings of Lieberkühn’s glands with its rostellum, dilating the\r\nlumen to two or three times its normal size, while the suckers remain\r\nfixed between the basal parts of the cells. Species with powerful\r\narmatures penetrate deeper into the submucosa, and some that are not\r\nprovided with exceptionally strong armatures, or are even unarmed,\r\nmay be actually found with the scolex embedded in the muscles of the\r\nintestinal walls or even protruding beyond (_Tænia tetragona_, Mol., in\r\nfowls, etc.). Other species, again, even cause perforation of the walls\r\nof the intestine of their hosts.\r\n\r\nIt is generally assumed that tapeworms, which almost without exception\r\nlive in the gut of vertebrates, get their nutriment from the gut\r\ncontents, which apparently they absorb through the whole body surface\r\n(cuticular trophopores). In favour of this view is the existence\r\nof fat drops in the proglottids, the identity in colour in certain\r\nforms between that of the fresh worm and the gut contents and the\r\npassage of certain substances derived from medicines (iron and mercury\r\npreparation) into the worms in the gut, etc. Whether the suckers are\r\nconcerned in the absorption of nutriment and to what extent is still\r\nquestionable.\r\n\r\nTHE LENGTH OF LIFE OF THE ADULT TAPEWORM certainly varies; as a rule\r\nit appears to last only about a year; in other cases (_Ligula_) it\r\naverages only a few days, but we are likewise aware that certain\r\nspecies of Cestodes of man attain an age of several or many years\r\n(thirty-five). The natural death of Cestodes often appears to be\r\nbrought about by alterations in the scolex, such as loss of the hooks,\r\natrophy of the suckers and rostellum, finally the dropping off of the\r\nscolex; it is unknown whether a chain of segments deprived of its\r\nscolex then perishes or whether it first attains maturity. It has\r\nalready been mentioned that in a few species the foremost proglottids\r\nare transformed into organs of fixation on the normal loss of the\r\nscolex.\r\n\r\n  Abnormalities and malformations are encountered relatively frequently\r\n  in the Cestodes--such as abnormally short or long segments;\r\n  the so-called triangular tapeworms, which--if belonging to the\r\n  _Tæniidæ_--always possess six suckers; often also club-shaped\r\n  segments occur between normal ones, or there may be a defect in\r\n  one segment or in the centre of a number following one another\r\n  (fenestrated segments); bifurcated chains of segments have likewise\r\n  been observed, as well as incomplete or complete union of the\r\n  proglottids, abnormal increase of the genital pores, reversion of\r\n  the genitalia. Besides the above-mentioned increase of the number\r\n  of suckers on the scolex (in Tæniæ), there may be a decrease in\r\n  the number; in other cases the crown of hooks may be absent, or\r\n  abnormally shaped hooks may be formed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF THE CESTODA OF MAN.\r\n\r\nOrder. *Pseudophyllidea*, Carus, 1863.\r\n\r\n  Scolex without proboscis or rostellum.

By some authors the term\r\n“_phyllidium_” is used for the outgrowth, and the term “_bothridium_”\r\nis restricted to the muscular cup. _Bothria_, on the other hand, are\r\ngrooves more or less wide, the musculature of which is only slightly\r\ndeveloped and is not separated off internally from the parenchyma.\r\n_Acetabula_, or suckers in the usual sense, are hemispherical cups,\r\nwithout lips and with musculature separated internally from the\r\nparenchyma.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Dibothriocephalidæ*, Lühe, 1902.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Diphyllobothriidæ_, Lühe, 1910.\r\n\r\n  Genitalia repeated in each proglottid (polyzootic Cestodes).

The uterus is in the central field, taking a\r\n  zigzag course, and frequently forms a rosette.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Dibothriocephalus latus*, L., 1748.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Tænia lata_, L., 1748; _Tænia vulgaris_, L., 1748;\r\n  _Tænia grisea_, Pallas, 1796; _Tænia membranacea_, Pall., 1781;\r\n  _Tænia tenella_, Pall., 1781; _Tænia dentata_, Batsch, 1786;\r\n  _Bothriocephalus latus_, Bremser, 1819; _Dibothrium latum_,\r\n  Dies., 1850; _Bothriocephalus cristatus_, Davaine, 1874[281];\r\n  _Bothriocephalus balticus_, Kchnmstr., 1855; _Bothriocephalus\r\n  latissimus_, Bugn., 1886.\r\n\r\n[281] Until recently this worm, which was understood to belong\r\nto a separate species, was proved on examination by R. Blanchard\r\n(“Mai. Par.,” 1896), to be _Dibothriocephalus latus_. Compare also\r\nGalli-Valerio, in _Centralbl. f. Bakt., Path. und Infektionskr._, 1900\r\n(1), xxvii, p. 308.\r\n\r\nLength 2 to 9 m. or more; colour yellowish-grey; after lying in water\r\nthe lateral areas become brownish and the uterine rosette brown. The\r\nhead is almond-shaped, 2 to 3 mm. in length, the dorso-ventral axis is\r\nlonger than the transverse diameter; the head, therefore, generally\r\nlying flat, conceals the suctorial grooves at the borders; these\r\nsuckers are deep and have sharp edges (fig. 205). The neck varies in\r\nlength according to the degree of contraction and is very thin; there\r\nare 3,000 to 4,200 proglottids and there may be more; their breadth is\r\nusually greater than their length, but in the posterior third of the\r\nbody they are almost square, and the very oldest are not uncommonly\r\nlonger than they are broad. There are numerous testes situated dorsally\r\nin the medullary layer of the lateral fields; the vas deferens\r\n(fig. 192) passes dorsally in transverse loops in the central field\r\nanteriorly and forms a seminal vesicle before its entry into the large\r\ncirrus pouch.\r\n\r\nThe orifice of the vagina is close behind the orifice of the cirrus;\r\nthe former passes almost straight along the median line posteriorly,\r\nand widens into a receptaculum seminis shortly before its junction\r\nwith the oviduct; the ovary is bilobed, in shape like the wings of\r\na butterfly, ventrally in the medullary layer; the shell glands lie\r\nin the posterior recess of the ovary; the uterus, forming numerous\r\ntransverse convolutions, passes ventral to the vas deferens forwards.\r\nEggs (fig. 207) large, with brownish shells and small lids, 68 µ to\r\n71 µ by 45 µ; the ovarian cell, which is already, as a rule, in process\r\nof segmentation, is surrounded by numerous large yolk cells; the\r\nproglottids nearest the posterior extremity are frequently eggless.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 204.--Various chains of segments of\r\n_Dibothriocephalus latus_, showing the central uterine rosette.\r\n(Natural size.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 205.--Transverse section of the head of\r\n_Dibothriocephalus latus_. 30/1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 206.--Fairly mature proglottis of\r\n_Dibothriocephalus latus_. The vitellaria are at the sides; the uterus,\r\nfilled with eggs, is in the middle, also the vagina (the dark stripe\r\npassing almost straight from the front to the back), and the vas\r\ndeferens (almost hidden by the uterus). Above in the centre is the\r\ncirrus sac, and below the shell gland and ovary are seen. 15/1. (From a\r\nstained preparation.)]\r\n\r\nThe eggs, which are deposited in the intestine and evacuated with\r\nthe fæces, hatch in water after a fortnight or more; the embryonal\r\nintegument (embryophore) of the oncosphere is provided with cilia;\r\nafter bursting open the lid of the egg the oncosphere in its\r\nembryophore (fig. 207) reaches the water and swims slowly about; often\r\nit slips out of its ciliated embryophore, sinks to the bottom and is\r\ncapable of a creeping motion; sooner or later it dies in the water.\r\nThe manner and means of its invasion of an intermediate host are\r\nstill unknown; yet we are aware that the larval stage (plerocercoid,\r\nfig. 208), which resembles the scolex and may reach a length of 30 mm.,\r\nlives in the intestine, in the intestinal wall, in the liver, spleen,\r\ngenital glands and muscular system (fig. 209) of various fresh-water\r\nfish, the pike (_Esox lucius_), the miller’s thumb (_Lota vulgaris_),\r\nthe perch (_Perea fluviatilis_), _Salmo umbla_, _Trutta vulgaris_, _Tr.\r\nlacustris_, _Thymallis vulgaris_ (grayling), _Coregonus lavaretus_,\r\n_C. albula_ (in Europe) and _Onchorhynchus perryi_ (in Japan). The\r\ntransmission of the plerocercoids from these fish to the dog, cat and\r\nman (Braun, Parona, Grassi and Ferrara, Grassi and Rovelli, Ijima,\r\nZschokke, Schroeder) leads to the development of the broad tapeworm,\r\nthe growth of which is rapid. In my experiments on human beings the\r\naverage number of proglottids formed per diem averaged thirty-one to\r\nthirty-two for five weeks, with a length of 8 to 9 cm. According to\r\nParona the eggs appear twenty-four days after man has been infected.\r\nZschokke found the average growth in the experimental infection of man\r\nbetween 5·2 and 8·2 cm. per diem, and the person experimented upon by\r\nIjima evacuated a piece of a _Dibothriocephalus latus_, 22·5 cm. in\r\nlength, only twenty-one days after the infection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 207.--_Dibothriocephalus latus_: development of\r\negg. 1, segmentation complete; some cells of the blastosphere have\r\nmigrated through the yolk and have flattened to form _c_, the yolk\r\nenvelope; others form a layer of flattened cells (_e_) forming the\r\nembryophore; the remaining cells (_d_) of the blastosphere form the\r\nhexacanth embryo. 2, embryophore (_e_) is becoming thicker. 3, the\r\nciliated embryo has been pressed out of the shell; _s′_, the operculum;\r\n_c_, the yolk envelope remaining in the shell (_s_); _y_, the yolk\r\nconsisting of separate cells. 4, a free-swimming larva much swollen by\r\nthe water.

French Switzerland and the Baltic Provinces of Russia are the\r\ncentres of distribution; from the former districts the distribution\r\nradiates to France and Italy (Lombardy, Piedmont); from the Baltic\r\nProvinces over Ingermanland to Petrograd, over Finland to Sweden (on\r\nthe shore of the Gulf of Bothnia), in a southerly direction to Poland,\r\nand into the Russian Empire and across it to Roumania, and towards\r\nthe west along the coast of the Baltic Sea to the North Sea, where,\r\nhowever, its frequency considerably diminishes (Holland, Belgium, and\r\nthe North of France).\r\n\r\nIn Turkestan and Japan the “broad tapeworm” is the most frequent\r\nparasite of man; it has been reported in Africa from the vicinity\r\nof Lake N’gami as well as from Madagascar; cases, in part at least\r\nimported, have also come under observation in North America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 208.--Plerocercoid of _Dibothricephalus latus_.\r\n_A._, with the head evaginated; _B._, with the head invaginated.

The tangential section has exposed the muscles of the trunk,\r\nwith a plerocercoid of _Dibothriocephalus latus_. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nIn Germany _Dibothriocephalus latus_--apart from the fact that it\r\nis undoubtedly imported from Switzerland, Russia or Italy--is\r\nparticularly frequent in East Prussia amongst the inhabitants of the\r\nCourland Lagoon district, on the Baltic; it is, moreover, also found in\r\nthe Province and even in the City of Königsberg. In West Prussia and\r\nPomerania it is very much scarcer.\r\n\r\nIt is also found in Munich and in the vicinity of the Lake of Starnberg\r\n(Bollinger).\r\n\r\nKrabbe found it in 10 per cent. of the sufferers from tapeworms in\r\nDenmark; Szydlowski found the ova of this worm in Dorpat in 10 per\r\ncent. of the fæces examined; Kruse found the worm in 6 per cent. of\r\n_post-mortems_; Kessler, in Petrograd, found the eggs in the fæces in\r\n7·8 per cent.; at _post-mortems_ he found the worms in 1·17 per cent.,\r\nthough Winogradoff only found it in 0·8 per cent. In Moscow, according\r\nto Baranovsky, 8·9 per cent. of the fæces examined contained the ova of\r\n_Dibothriocephalus_. In the interior and southern provinces of Sweden\r\nthe worm, according to Lönnberg, is only found sporadically, but, on\r\nthe other hand, in Angermanland about 10 per cent. of the population\r\nis affected; while again in Norbotten the majority of persons are\r\naffected, and in Haparanda the entire population (with the exception\r\nof infants) harbour this parasite. In Switzerland _D. latus_ is very\r\nfrequent in close proximity to the lakes of Bieler, Neuchatel, Morat\r\nand Geneva (according to Zaeslin 10 to 15 to 20 per cent. of the\r\npopulation are affected); the parasite is less frequent in districts\r\none to four hours removed from these lakes.\r\n\r\nOf the fish from Swiss lakes examined by Schor those from Lake Geneva\r\nwere most commonly infected, and especially _Lota_ sp. and _Perea_ sp.\r\n\r\nThe frequency and distribution have, nevertheless, decreased\r\nperceptibly in places; at the commencement of the eighteenth century\r\nthe broad tapeworm was very common in Paris, at the present date it\r\nonly occurs when imported (Blanchard); in Geneva, also, according to\r\nZschokke, it has become rarer (formerly 10 per cent., now only 1 per\r\ncent.).\r\n\r\nThe disturbances produced in man by the presence of broad tapeworms\r\nare, as a rule, very trifling; in other cases they produce partly\r\ngastric disorders and partly nervous symptoms; in a number of cases,\r\nagain, they set up severe anæmia, apparently caused by toxins\r\nproduced by the worms and absorbed by the host. There is no danger\r\nof auto-infection, as the larval stage lives only in fishes, not in\r\nwarm-blooded animals. The case reported by Meschede (ova like those of\r\n_Dibothriocephalus latus_ in the brain of a man who had suffered from\r\nepilepsy for six years) must be otherwise explained.\r\n\r\nHuman beings, like other hosts, can only acquire the broad tapeworm by\r\ningesting its plerocercoids with the previously mentioned fresh-water\r\nfishes; the opportunity for such infection is afforded the more readily\r\nby the fact that not only do the lower classes not pay sufficient\r\nattention to the cooking of fish, so that all the larvæ that are\r\npresent may be killed, but also in certain localities the custom exists\r\nof eating some parts of these fishes in a raw condition; even the\r\nmere handling of the usually severely infected intermediary hosts may\r\noccasionally cause infection. The plerocercoids are as well known as,\r\nbut differ materially in appearance from, the cysticerci (_Cysticercus\r\ncellulosæ_) of pig’s flesh. In Germany the occurrence of the\r\nplerocercoids of _Dibothriocephalus latus_ has been confirmed in the\r\npike, miller’s thumb and perch of East Prussia, and more particularly\r\nin those taken from the Courland Lagoon.\r\n\r\nThe life of _D. latus_ is a very long one (six to fourteen years), as\r\nis deduced from persons who have left _D. latus_ regions after they\r\nhave been infected.\r\n\r\nAccording to the experiments of M. Schor, plerocercoids of _D. latus_\r\nplaced in slowly warmed water completely lose their movement at 54° to\r\n55° C.; they survive the death of their host for several days; they\r\nare killed by low temperatures -3° to +1° C. in two days; strong acids\r\nand salt solutions kill them at once, also high temperatures, but all\r\nthe same at least ten minutes is required in boiling or frying fish in\r\norder to kill the plerocercoids with certainty.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Dibothriocephalus cordatus*, R.

Anzeiger_, 1882, v,\r\n  p. 46), as also has the report that this worm lives in hares in the\r\n  neighbourhood of Berlin, whither it was supposed to have been carried\r\n  by Esquimaux dogs (Rosenkranz in _Deutsch. med. Wochenschr._, 1877,\r\n  iii, p. 620).

On either side to the right\r\nand left of the worm, along the entire ventral surface, there is a\r\nlongitudinal groove; these grooves are nearer to each other than to\r\nthe lateral margin; in them lie the genital pores, and they are in the\r\nsame sequence as in _Dibothriocephalus_; corresponding to the scanty\r\nlength (0·45 mm.) of the proglottids, the ovary is only developed\r\ntransversely; the uterus only makes a few loops.

Manson during\r\nthe _post-mortem_ on a Chinaman who had died in Amoy, twelve\r\nspecimens being found beneath the peritoneum and one free in the\r\nabdominal cavity. Cobbold described them as _Ligula mansoni_, and\r\nLeuckart, who contemporaneously reported a case in Japan, termed them\r\n_Bothriocephalus liguloides_. Ijima and Murata reported eight further\r\ncases, and Miyake records nine further cases, seven of which are\r\nrecorded in Japanese literature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 213.--Cephalic end of _Sparganum mansoni_, Cobb.\r\n(After Leuckart.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 214.--_Sparganum mansoni_: on the right in\r\ntransverse section. Natural size. (After Ijima and Murata.)]\r\n\r\nThe plerocercoid, which hitherto alone is known to us, attains a length\r\nof 30 cm. and a breadth of 3 to 6 to 12 mm. The ribbon-shaped body is\r\nwrinkled, the lateral borders are often somewhat thickened, so that\r\nthe transverse section has the form of a biscuit; the anterior end\r\nis usually wider and has the head provided with two weak suctorial\r\ngrooves, either retracted or protracted.\r\n\r\nThe parasite makes migrations within the body, and thus may reach the\r\nurinary passages; then it is either evacuated with the urine or has\r\nto be removed from the urethra; not rarely it causes non-inflammatory\r\ntumours on various parts of the skin, which are at times painful and at\r\ntimes vary in size.\r\n\r\nNothing is known of its development and origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Sparganum proliferum*, Ijima, 1905.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Plerocercoides prolifer_, Ijima, 1905; _Sparganum prolifer_,\r\n  Verdun, Manson, 1907.\r\n\r\nThese plerocercoids produce an acne-like condition of the skin.\r\nThe condition is really one of capsules in great abundance in the\r\nsubcutaneous tissue and less so in the corium and in the intermuscular\r\nconnective tissue. The encapsuled worms in the corium feel like\r\nembedded rice grains and raise the epidermis, giving rise to an\r\nacne-like condition. Many thousands occur scattered over the body; in\r\nIjima’s Japanese case there were over 10,000 in the left thigh. The\r\nworms when they first appear in the skin cause itching. The capsules\r\nare ovoid, generally about 1 to 2 mm. in diameter, but they may be\r\nsmaller and also much larger. The larger ones occur in the subcutaneous\r\ntissue. The capsules consist of dense tough connective tissue.\r\n\r\nEach capsule, as a rule, contains one worm, but as many as seven may\r\noccur. The skin of areas that have been long infected is swollen and\r\nindurated or adherent, giving a somewhat elephantoid appearance. The\r\nsubcutaneous tissue is thick and filled with slimy fluid or in other\r\nparts sclerosed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 215.--_Sparganum prolifer_: left with buds, right\r\nextended. × 4. (After Ijima.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 216.--_Sparganum proliferum._ × 10. (After Stiles.)]\r\n\r\n_The Worm._--The chief peculiarity is its irregular shape and its\r\nreproduction in the larval stage by forming supernumerary heads, which\r\nare supposed to wander about the body.\r\n\r\nThe simplest forms are thread-like bodies, flat or round, 3 mm. long\r\nand 0·3 mm. in diameter, but they may be 12 mm. long by 2·5 mm. broad.\r\nThe narrow end is the head, which in life invaginates and evaginates,\r\nbut there is no indication of any suckers, except an inconstant\r\nterminal depression. In addition to these simple forms the most\r\ncomplicated and irregular forms occur, due to the formation of buds\r\n(heads) at various parts. The detachment and growth of a head account\r\nfor the presence of more than one worm in a cyst. The irregularity in\r\nform is also increased by the presence in the subcuticular tissue of\r\nthe worm of _reserve food bodies_. These bodies are supposed to be of\r\nthis nature and are spherical, 100 µ to 300 µ in diameter, but also\r\nmuch elongated.\r\n\r\n_Calcareous bodies_ in the Japanese worms were 7·5 µ to 12 µ; in the\r\nFlorida worms 8·8 µ to 17·6 µ.\r\n\r\n_Mode of Infection._--Probably from eating uncooked fish.\r\n\r\n_Distribution._--Japan, Florida.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Dipylidiidæ*, Lühe, 1910.\r\n\r\nGenus. *Dipylidium*, R.

Genital pores opposite; genitalia double. Testes very numerous\r\n  in the central field; ovary with two lobes; the vitellaria, which are\r\n  smaller, behind them; the uterus forms a reticulum, in the network of\r\n  which the testicular vesicles lie; later on it breaks up into sacs\r\n  enclosing one or several eggs.

The neck is very short,\r\nthe most anterior segments broad and short, the middle as long as they\r\nare broad; the mature segments are longer than wide (6 to 7 mm. by 2\r\nto 3 mm.), fairly thick, are frequently of a reddish colour, and when\r\ncast off resemble cucumber seeds. The genital pores lie symmetrically\r\nat the lateral margins; the roundish egg sacs, arising from the\r\nuterine reticulum, contain eight to fifteen eggs embedded in a reddish\r\ncement substance (in life). The eggs are globular (43 µ to 50 µ,); the\r\nembryonal shell (embryophore) is thin, the oncosphere measures 32 µ to\r\n36 µ. Surrounding the embryophore is an albuminous coating, and outside\r\nthis the thin vitelline envelope (fig. 218).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 219.--_Dipylidium caninum_: central portion of a\r\nproglottis. _C.p._, cirrus sac; _V.s._, vitellaria; _Ex.v._, excretory\r\nvessels; _T._, testicles lying in the meshes of the uterine reticulum\r\nwhich laterally forms pouches; _O._, ovary; _U._, reticulum of uterus;\r\n_V._, vagina and seminal receptacle (below ovary).

(After\r\nBenham, Grassi and Rovelli.)]\r\n\r\n_Dipylidium caninum_ is a common intestinal parasite of dogs, in\r\nwhich it grows larger (_Tænia cucumerina_, Bloch) than in cats (_T.\r\nelliptica_, Batsch); it has, however, also been found in jackals, as\r\nwell as in human beings, though in the latter it is of comparatively\r\nrare occurrence (twenty-four cases), and almost always affects\r\nchildren, generally of tender age. One-third of all the cases in\r\nchildren were sucklings, about a quarter of all the cases recorded were\r\nadults, and these occurred throughout all Europe with the exception of\r\nSpain and Italy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 221.--Larva (cysticercoid) of _Dipylidium caninum_,\r\nconsisting of body and tail.

The hooklets are shown in front\r\nof the excretory system which has now developed. At a further stage\r\nthe tail drops off; the head now evaginates, but is still enclosed in\r\na double-walled sac formed by the prolongation upwards on each side of\r\nthe topmost parts of the body shown in the figure. _Cf._ fig. 220, 6.\r\nEnlarged. (After Grassi and Rovelli.)]\r\n\r\nThe proglottids, which leave the intestine spontaneously, are\r\nrecognizable by the naked eye on account of their form and reddish\r\ncolour, as well as their two genital pores. As a rule, the presence of\r\nthis parasite sets up no marked symptom in the patient.\r\n\r\nThe corresponding larval form (cysticercoid) lives in the louse of\r\nthe dog (_Trichodectes canis_), a fact that was first established by\r\nMelnikow and Leuckart; according to Grassi and Rovelli, as well as\r\nSonsino, it also lives in the flea of the dog (_Ctenocephalus canis_)\r\nand in the flea of man (_Pulex irritans_), but not in its larva.\r\nThe adult segments, which also leave the rectum of dogs and cats\r\nspontaneously, creep about around the anus and get into the hair, and\r\nare thus partly dried and disintegrated. Part of the segments, or the\r\noncospheres released by disintegration, are then taken up by lice and\r\nfleas, within which they develop into larvæ (cysticercoids). Dogs and\r\ncats are thus infected by their own skin parasites, which they bite\r\nand swallow whilst gnawing at their fur. The infection of human beings\r\nmust occur in an analogous manner, by transmission of the cysticercoids\r\npresent on the lips or tongue of dogs when the latter lick them, or it\r\nmay be that the vermin of cats and dogs harbouring cysticercoids are\r\naccidentally and directly swallowed by human beings.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Hymenolepididæ*, Railliet and Henry, 1909.\r\n\r\nGenus. *Hymenolepis*,[282] Weinland, 1858.\r\n\r\n[282] The genus is by some authors divided into two\r\nsub-genera--Hymenolepis, s. str., and Drepanidotænia, Raill.\r\n\r\n_Drepanidotænia._--Body, broad lanceolate, testes three, female\r\ngenitalia antiporal beside the testes.

Spooner (1873) even\r\nreported a case from North America, which may, however, have related\r\nto _Hymenolepis diminuta_. In Europe the worm is particularly frequent\r\nin Sicily, but it has also been repeatedly observed in North Italy;\r\nit has, moreover, been reported from Russia, Servia, England, France,\r\nGermany, North and South America, the Philippines, Siam and Japan, in\r\nall over 100 cases. Notwithstanding its small size this worm causes\r\nconsiderable disorders in its hosts--mostly children--as it sets up\r\nloss of appetite, diarrhœa, various nervous disturbances, and even\r\nepilepsy; all these symptoms, however, disappear after the expulsion of\r\nthe parasites, which are generally present in large numbers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 222.--_Hymenolepis nana_, v.

Enlarged. (After Grassi and Rovelli.)]\r\n\r\nThe development as well as the manner of infection is still unknown;\r\nGrassi is of opinion that _Hymenolepis nana_ is indeed merely a variety\r\nof _Hymenolepis murina_, Duj., which lives in rats. According to\r\nGrassi direct development takes place with omission of the intermediate\r\nhost, but with the retention of the larval stage; that is to say, rats\r\ninfect themselves directly with _Hymenolepis murina_, by ingesting the\r\nmature segments or oncospheres of this species, from which subsequently\r\nthe small larvæ originate in the intestinal wall (fig. 225); when fully\r\ndeveloped they fall into the intestinal lumen and become tapeworms.\r\nThe identity of the two forms has nevertheless been disputed (Moniez,\r\nR. Blanchard, v. Linstow), though their near relationship cannot be\r\ndenied. Grassi gave mature segments of _Hymenolepis murina_ to six\r\npersons, but only one person evacuated a tapeworm. This, however,\r\nproves nothing in a district where _Hymenolepis nana_ frequently\r\noccurs in man; it was, moreover, not possible to infect rats with\r\nsegments of _Hymenolepis nana_ (of man). Accordingly this form may\r\nrepresent an independent species, which, however, like _Hymenolepis\r\nmurina_, also omits an intermediate host.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Hymenolepis diminuta*, Rud., 1819.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Tænia diminuta_, Rud., 1819; _Tænia leptocephala_, Crepl.,\r\n  1825; _Tænia flavopunctata_, Weinld., 1858; _Tænia varesina_, E.\r\n  Parona, 1884; _Tænia minima_, Grassi, 1886.\r\n\r\nThis species measures 20 to 60 cm. in length, and up to 3·5 mm. in\r\nbreadth; there are from 600 to 1,000 segments. The head is very small\r\n(0·2 to 0·5 mm.), it is club-shaped and has a rudimentary unarmed\r\nrostellum; the neck is short; the mature segments are 3·5 mm. in\r\nbreadth, 0·66 mm. in length; the eggs are round or oval. The outer\r\negg-shell is yellowish and thickened, with indistinct radial stripes;\r\nthe inner embryonal shell (embryophore) double, thin; the outer layer\r\nis somewhat pointed at the poles; oncosphere 28 µ by 36 µ. Between the\r\ninner and outer shells is a middle granular layer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 228.--_Hymenolepis diminuta_: scolex.

(After\r\nGrassi.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 230.--_Hymenolepis diminuta_: egg from man. (After\r\nBizzozero.)]\r\n\r\n_Hymenolepis diminuta_ lives in the intestine of rats--_Mus decumanus_\r\n(the sewer rat), _Mus rattus_ (the black rat), and _Mus alexandrinus_,\r\nrarely in mice; it is occasionally also found in human beings.\r\n\r\nWeinland described it from specimens collected by Dr. E. Palmer in\r\n1842, in Boston, from a child aged 19 months, as _T. flavopunctata_.\r\nA second case relating to a three year old child, from Philadelphia,\r\nwas only reported in 1889 by Leidy; a third case was simultaneously\r\nreported of a two year old girl in Varese (_T. varesina_); and Grassi\r\ndescribed another case relating to a twelve year old girl from Catania\r\n(Sicily). Sonsino and Previtera reported the same species in Italy,\r\nZschokke in France, Lutz and Magalhães in South America, and Packard\r\nin North America: a total of twelve cases, five from America, the rest\r\nfrom Europe (Ransom).\r\n\r\nAccording to Grassi and Rovelli the larval stage lives in a small\r\nmoth (_Asopia farinalis_), as well as in its larva, in an orthopteron\r\n(_Anisolabis annulipes_), and in coleoptera (_Acis spinosa_ and\r\n_Scaurus striatus_). Experimental infections have been successful on\r\nrats as well as on human beings. In America other species of insects\r\nmay be the intermediary hosts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 231.--_Hymenolepis diminuta_: cysticercoid from the\r\nrat flea (_Ceratophyllus fasciatus_). _a_, remains of primary vesicle;\r\n_b_, fibrous layer; _c_, radially striated layer resembling cuticle;\r\n_d_, layer of columnar cells; _e_, parenchymatous layer of irregularly\r\ndisposed cells; _f_, parenchymatous layer. (Stephens, after Nicoll and\r\nMinchin.)]\r\n\r\nNicoll and Minchin[283] found in the body cavity of 4 per cent. of rat\r\nfleas (_Ceratophyllus fasciatus_) the cysticercoid of _Hymenolepis\r\ndiminuta_. That it belonged to this species was shown by its unarmed\r\nrostellum and by feeding; 340 fleas were fed to white rats and\r\nfourteen worms obtained, _i.e._, about 4 per cent., thus corresponding\r\nto the infection of the fleas. The development in the flea probably\r\nbegins in the pupal stage, the eggs being ingested by the older flea\r\nlarvæ. The larva is 0·31 by 0·25 mm.; tail 0·8 mm., scolex 0·075 by\r\n0·09 mm., suckers, 0·055 mm. in diameter. Microscopically it shows--(1)\r\nexternally a radially striated layer resembling cuticle, (2) a layer of\r\ncolumnar cells, (3) parenchymatous layer continuous with the tail, (4)\r\nfibrous layer around the small caudal vesicle, then the parenchymatous\r\nscolex at the bottom of the secondary cavity.\r\n\r\n[283] _Proc. Zool. Soc._, 1911, p. 9.\r\n\r\nNicoll and Minchin (_loc. cit._) found a cysticercoid[284] in the rat\r\nflea _Ceratophyllus fasciatus_ which was probably that of _Hymenolepis\r\nmurina_. Body 0·16 mm., tail 0·19 mm., scolex 0·096 mm. in diameter.\r\nRostellum has twenty-three spines in a single row. Length 0·017 mm.,\r\nhandle 0·01 mm., guard 0·007 mm., prong 0·007 mm. Sucker 0·042 mm.\r\nAlthough this cycle, then, for _H. murina_ also exists, it is not\r\nprobable that rats (or man in the case of _H. nana_ if this be\r\nconsidered distinct) infect themselves in this way, as they hardly\r\ningest all the necessary fleas to account for the massive infection\r\nwhich frequently exists in rats (and man), so that Grassi’s cycle holds\r\ngood as the predominant method. _Xenopsylla cheopis_ has also been\r\nfound by Johnston to harbour both cysticercoids in Australia.\r\n\r\n[284] A third cysticercoid resembling this, but without hooks, has also\r\nbeen found.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Hymenolepis lanceolata*, Bloch, 1782.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Tænia lanceolata_, Bloch, 1782; _Drepanidotænia lanceolata_,\r\n  Railliet, 1892.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 232.--_Hymenolepis lanceolata_.

The neck is very short. The short segments increase gradually\r\nand equally in breadth, but only a little in length; the female\r\nglands lie on the side opposite to that on which the genital pore is\r\nsituated; the three elliptical testes are on the same side as the\r\npores; the cirrus is armed and slender. The eggs have three envelopes\r\nand are oval (50 µ by 35 µ), the external envelope is thin, the middle\r\nintermediate layer or envelope is not so marked as in _H. diminuta_,\r\nand the internal one is very thin and sometimes has polar papillæ, as\r\nin _Hymenolepis diminuta_ and _H. nana_.\r\n\r\nIt inhabits the intestine of the following birds: Domesticated ducks\r\nand geese, the Muscovy duck (_Cairina moschata_), white-headed duck\r\n(_Erismatura leucocephala_), the pochard (_Nyroca rufina_), and the\r\nflamingo (_Phœnicopterus antiquorum_). It has been recorded from Great\r\nBritain, France, Denmark, Austria and Germany.\r\n\r\nZschokke reports the receipt of two specimens which a twelve year old\r\nboy in Breslau evacuated spontaneously at two different times.\r\n\r\nThe corresponding larva, according to Mrázek, lives in fresh water\r\n_Cyclops_; according to Dadai it is likewise found in another copepod,\r\n_Diaptomus spinosus_, but the hooks of Dadai’s larva differed in size.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Davaineidæ*, Fuhrmann, 1907.\r\n\r\nSub-family. *Davaineinæ*, Braun, 1900.\r\n\r\nGenus. *Davainea*, R.

Neck absent, proglottids few, genitalia single.\r\n  Parasitic chiefly in birds.[285]\r\n\r\n[285] [The larval stage of the Davaineas occurs in slugs (_Limax_) and\r\nsnails (_Helix_).--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n\r\n*Davainea madagascariensis*, Davaine, 1869.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Tænia madagascariensis_, Dav.; _Tænia demerariensis_, Daniels,\r\n  1895.\r\n\r\nThis worm measures 25 to 30 cm. in length; the head has four large\r\nround suckers; the rostellum has ninety hooks (18 µ in length); there\r\nare 500 to 700 segments, of which the last 100 are filled with eggs and\r\nform half of the entire worm. The segments, when mature, measure 2 mm.\r\nin length by 1·4 mm. in breadth; genital pores unilateral; about fifty\r\ntestes; the uterus consists of a number of loops, which at each side\r\nare rolled up into an almost spherical ball; when filled with eggs the\r\nconvolutions unwind, permeate the segment and then lose their wall; the\r\neggs lying free in the parenchyma become finally surrounded, one, or\r\nseveral together, by proliferating parenchymatous cells; this is how\r\nthe 300 to 400 egg masses, taking up the entire mature segment, are\r\nformed. The globular oncosphere (8 µ) is surrounded by two perfectly\r\ntransparent shells, the outer of which terminates in two pointed\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 234.--Scolex of _Davainea madagascariensis_. The\r\nhooks have fallen off. 14/1. (After Blanchard.)]\r\n\r\n_Davainea madagascariensis_ has hitherto been found in man only (eight\r\ntimes). Davaine described this species from fragments sent to him from\r\nMayotta (Comoro Islands), which were found in two Creole children.\r\nChevreau observed four cases in Port Louis (Mauritius), likewise\r\nin children; Leuckart received the first perfect specimen--it was\r\nobtained from a three year old boy, the son of a Danish captain, in\r\nBangkok; Daniels, at the _post-mortem_ of an adult native of George\r\nTown, Guiana, found two specimens (_Tænia demerariensis_); and finally\r\nBlanchard describes another perfect specimen which was in Davaine’s\r\ncollection of helminthes in Paris, and which was obtained from a little\r\ngirl 3 years old, of Nossi-Bé (Madagascar). The intermediate host is\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Davainea (?) asiatica*, v. Linst., 1901.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Tænia asiatica_, v.

It came from a human\r\nbeing and was found by Anger in Aschabad (Asiatic Russia, near the\r\nnorthern frontier of Persia). The specimen measures 298 mm. in length.\r\nThe breadth anteriorly is only 0·16 mm., the posterior part measures\r\n1·78 mm. across. The number of segments is about 750. The genital pores\r\nare unilateral; the testes are globular and lie in a dorsal and ventral\r\nlayer in the medullary layer; the cirrus pouch is pyriform, 0·079 mm.\r\nin length and 0·049 mm. in breadth; the female glands lie in the\r\nfore-part of the segments, the ovary reaching to the excretory vessels;\r\nthe vitellarium is small and round. The vagina has a large fusiform\r\nreceptaculum seminis; the uterus breaks up into sixty to seventy large,\r\nirregularly polyhedric eggsacs.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Tæniidæ*, Ludwig, 1886.\r\n\r\nGenus. *Tænia*, L., 1758.[286]\r\n\r\n  With the characters of the family. In the genus Cladotænia recognized\r\n  by some authors, the testes encroach on the mid field and the uterine\r\n  stem reaches the anterior end of the segment.\r\n\r\n[286] The Greeks termed the tapeworms ἕλμινθες πλατεῖαι, more rarely\r\nχηρία (= fascia); the Romans called them _tænia_, _tinea_, _tæniola_,\r\nlater _lumbrici_, usually with the addition _lati_, to distinguish\r\nthem from the _Lumbrici teretes_ (_Ascaridæ_). The proglottids were\r\ncalled _Vermes cucurbitini_; the cysticerci χάλαζαι (hailstones),\r\nlater hydatids. Plater (1602) was the first to differentiate _Tænia\r\nintestinorum_ (= _Bothriocephalus latus_) amongst the _Lumbrici lati_\r\nof man from _Tænia longissima_ (= _Tænia solium_). The term _solium_\r\nwas already used by Arnoldus Villanovanus, who lived about 1300; and,\r\naccording to him, it signifies “cingulum” (belt, chain), while N.\r\nAndry, in 1700, traces this word from “solus,” because the worm occurs\r\nalways singly in man. Leuckart and Krehl derive the word “solium”\r\nfrom the Syrian “schuschl” (the chain), which in Arabian has become\r\n“susl” or “sosl,” and in Latin has become “sol-ium.” What Linnæus\r\ndescribed under the term _Tænia solium_ was really _Tænia saginata_;\r\nthe latter was first distinguished by Goeze, but was forgotten until\r\nKüchenmeister, in 1852, again called attention to the differences.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Tænia solium*, L., _p. p._, 1767.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Tænia cucurbitina_, Pall., 1781; _Tænia pellucida_, Goeze,\r\n  1782; _Tænia vulgaris_, Werner, 1782; _Tænia dentata_, Gmel., 1790;\r\n  _Halysis solium_, Zeder, 1800; _Tænia humana armata_, Brera, 1802;\r\n  _Tænia_ (_Cystotænia_) _solium_, Lkt., 1862.\r\n\r\nThe average length of the entire tapeworm is about 2 to 3 m., but may\r\nbe even more; the head is globular, 0·6 to 0·8 to 1·0 mm. in diameter.\r\nThe rostellum is short with a double circlet of hooks, twenty-two to\r\nthirty-two in number, usually twenty-six to twenty-eight; large and\r\nsmall hooks alternate regularly; the length of the large hooks is\r\n0·16 to 0·18 mm., of the small ones 0·11 to 0·14 mm. The rostellum is\r\nsometimes pigmented. The suckers are hemispherical, 0·4 to 0·5 mm.\r\nin diameter. The neck is fairly thin and long (5 to 10 mm.). The\r\nproglottids, the number of which averages from 800 to 900, increase in\r\nsize very gradually; at about 1 m. behind the head they are square and\r\nhave the genitalia fully developed. Segments sufficiently mature for\r\ndetachment measure 10 to 12 mm. in length by 5 to 6 mm. in breadth. The\r\ngenital pores alternate fairly evenly at the lateral margin a little\r\nbehind the middle of each segment. The fully developed uterus consists\r\nof a median trunk, with seven to ten lateral branches at either side,\r\nsome of which are again ramified. The eggs are oval, the egg-shell\r\nvery thin and delicate; the embryonal shell (embryophore) is thick,\r\nwith radial stripes; it is of a pale yellowish colour, globular, and\r\nmeasures 31 µ to 36 µ in diameter; the oncospheres, with six hooks, are\r\nlikewise globular, and measure 20 µ in diameter (fig. 238).\r\n\r\n  Malformations are not so common as in _T. saginata_; they consist in\r\n  two or several proglottids being partly or entirely fused, formation\r\n  of single club-shaped segments, fenestration of long or short series\r\n  of segments and so-called double formation, in which the head has six\r\n  suckers and the segments exhibit a *Y*-shaped transverse section. The\r\n  oncospheres occasionally also possess more than six hooklets. Very\r\n  slender specimens have led to the description of a particular species\r\n  or variety (_T. tenella_).\r\n\r\nIn its fully developed condition _T. solium_ is found exclusively in\r\nman; the head is usually attached in the anterior third of the small\r\nintestine and the chain, in numerous convolutions, extends backwards;\r\na few mature detached proglottids usually lie at the most posterior\r\npart, and these are usually evacuated during defæcation. In exceptional\r\ncases single proglottids or whole worms may reach contiguous organs\r\nif abnormal communications with them exist; thus they may reach the\r\nabdominal cavity and the urinary bladder, or they may be found in a\r\nso-called worm abscess of the peritoneum; occasionally, in vomiting,\r\nsingle segments or several together may be brought up. Exceptionally it\r\ninduces severe anæmia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 235.--Two fairly mature proglottids of _Tænia\r\nsolium_, showing ovaries (one bi-lobed), vitellaria, central uterine\r\nstem, cirrus and vas deferens (above), vagina (below), testes\r\n(scattered), longitudinal and transverse excretory vessels.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 236.--Head of _Tænia solium_. 45/1.]\r\n\r\nThe _larval stage_ (_Cysticercus cellulosæ_) that gives rise to _Tænia\r\nsolium_ lives normally in the intramuscular connective tissue and other\r\norgans of the domestic pig, but it is known to exist also in a few\r\nother mammals, such as the wild boar, the sheep,[287] the stag, dog,\r\ncat, brown bear and monkey, as well as in man. The cysticercus of\r\nthe pig is an elliptical vesicle with a longitudinal diameter of 6 to\r\n20 mm., and a transverse diameter of 5 to 10 mm.\r\n\r\n[287] The larvæ which on rare occasions are found in the muscular\r\nsystem of sheep are either strayed specimens of _Cysticercus\r\ntenuicollis_, which normally develop in organs of the abdominal cavity,\r\nand appertain to _Tænia marginata_ of the dog, or actually _Cysticercus\r\ncellulosæ_. (_Cf._ Bongert, in _Zeitschr. f. Fleisch- u. Milchhyg._,\r\n1899, ix, p. 86.)\r\n\r\nEven with the naked eye a white spot may be observed in the centre\r\nof the long equator, this being the invaginated head; it is easy to\r\nmake it project by pressing on the vesicle (after tearing off with the\r\nfinger-nail the investing connective tissue), and on examining it under\r\nthe microscope one can convince oneself that it corresponds with the\r\nhead of _Tænia solium_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 237.--Large and small hooks of _Tænia solium_.\r\n280/1. (After Leuckart.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 238.--_Tænia solium._ 21, Egg with external\r\nmembrane; 22, without (embryophore). (After Leuckart.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 239.--Two mature proglottids of _Tænia solium_ with\r\nfully developed uterus. 2/1.]\r\n\r\nNumerous experiments have proved that the _Cysticercus cellulosæ_\r\nof the pig, if introduced into the intestine of man, grows to a\r\n_Tænia solium_ (Küchenmeister, 1855; Humbert, 1856; Leuckart, 1856;\r\nHollenbach, 1859; Heller, 1876); the cysticercus has frequently also\r\nbeen cultivated purposely by feeding pigs with mature proglottids of\r\n_T. solium_ (P. J. van Beneden, 1853; Haubner and Küchenmeister, 1855;\r\nLeuckart, 1856; Mosler, 1865; Gerlach, 1870; etc.), but success did not\r\nattend the efforts to make _Cysticercus cellulosæ_ establish themselves\r\nin the intestines of pigs, dogs, guinea-pigs, rabbits and monkeys\r\n(_Macacus cynomolgus_), and so become adult Tæniæ; the attempts, also,\r\nto infect dogs with cysticerci by means of ova were likewise, as a\r\nrule, abortive.[288]\r\n\r\n[288] According to Gerlach only young pigs (up to 6 months old) are\r\ncapable of infection, and perhaps the failure may have been due to the\r\nanimals chosen for experiment being of the wrong age.\r\n\r\n  The development of _Cysticercus cellulosæ_ takes two and a half\r\n  to three or four months; it is not known how long the cysticerci\r\n  remain alive in animals; not uncommonly they perish at earlier or\r\n  later stages, and become calcified or caseated. Extracted cysticerci\r\n  die in water at a temperature of 47° to 48° C., in flesh at normal\r\n  temperature they remain alive for twenty-nine days or more. On\r\n  account of the present rapid means of pickling and smoking meat, the\r\n  cysticerci as a rule are not killed, also the effect of cold on them\r\n  for some time in cold chambers of slaughterhouses is not lethal, but\r\n  freezing is fatal (Ostertag).\r\n\r\nThere is not the least doubt that human beings are almost exclusively\r\ninfected with _Tænia solium_ by eating pork containing cysticerci in\r\na condition that does not endanger the life of the cysticerci. The\r\ninfection may likewise be caused in man by eating the infected meat of\r\nother animals subject to this species of bladder worm, mainly, as a\r\nmatter of fact, deer and wild boar.\r\n\r\n  The frequency of cysticerci in pigs’ flesh has considerably decreased\r\n  since the introduction of meat inspection; in the Kingdom of Prussia\r\n  there was on an average 1 infected pig to every 305 slaughtered\r\n  between 1876 to 1882; from 1886 to 1889, there was 1 to 551; from\r\n  1890 to 1892, there was 1 to 817; in 1896, 1 to 1,470; and in 1899, 1\r\n  to 2,102; in the Kingdom of Saxony in 1894 there was 1 infected pig\r\n  to every 636; in 1895 there was 1 to every 2,049, and in 1896 only 1\r\n  infected pig was found of 5,886 slaughtered. In South Germany pigs\r\n  with cysticerci are very rare, but are more frequent in the eastern\r\n  provinces of Prussia; in 1892 the number of infected pigs compared\r\n  with the total slaughtered was as follows:--\r\n\r\n  In the district of Marienwerder                           1 :    28\r\n    \"      \"         Oppeln                                 1 :    80\r\n    \"      \"         Königsberg                             1 :   108\r\n    \"      \"         Stralsund and Posen                    1 :   187\r\n    \"      \"         Danzig, Frankfort a. O. and Bromberg   1 :   250\r\n  As compared with the district of Arnsberg                 1 :   865\r\n        \"      \"           \"       Coblenz                  1 :   975\r\n        \"      \"           \"       Düsseldorf               1 : 1,070\r\n        \"      \"           \"       Münster and Wiesbaden    1 : 1,900\r\n\r\n  The average for the whole of Prussia in the same year was 1 : 1,290;\r\n  for the eastern provinces, on the other hand, 1 : 604. Even more\r\n  unfavourable are the proportions in Russian Poland (over 1 per\r\n  cent. of pigs measly), in Prague (over 3 per cent.), in Bosnia and\r\n  Herzegovina (6 to 7 per cent.). The cause for this is most likely\r\n  attributable to the manner in which the pigs are kept. When allowed\r\n  to be in the farmyards of the small farmers for the whole day, or\r\n  allowed to wander in the village streets and pasture lands, they are\r\n  more liable to take up the oncospheres of the _T. solium_ than when\r\n  shut up in good pig-styes.\r\n\r\nThe geographical distribution of _T. solium_ generally corresponds\r\nwith that of the domestic pig and the custom of eating pork in any\r\nform insufficiently cooked or raw. There are, or were, some isolated\r\ndistricts in Germany, France, Italy and England where the “armed\r\ntapeworm” was frequent (for instance, Thuringia, Brunswick, Saxony,\r\nHesse, Westphalia, whereas it is and was very scarce in South Germany);\r\nit is thus easily understood why it occurs very rarely in the East, in\r\nAsia and in Africa, in consequence of the Mahommedans, Jews, etc.,\r\nnot eating pork. In North America, also, _T. solium_ is very rare; the\r\ntapeworm which is known there by this name is generally _T. saginata_,\r\nStiles. During the last decade _T. solium_ infection has, however,\r\nvery markedly decreased in North and East Germany in consequence of\r\nthe precautions exercised by the public in the choice of pork to avoid\r\ntrichinosis, especially, however, because measly meat must be sold as\r\nsuch and must be thoroughly cooked before being placed on the market;\r\nindeed, if badly infected it may not be sold for food, but can be\r\nturned to account for industrial purposes.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of _Cysticercus cellulosæ_ in man has been known since\r\n1558 (Rumler, _Obs. med._, liii, p. 32); there is hardly an organ in\r\nman in which cysticerci have not been observed at some time; they are\r\nmost frequently found in the brain,[289] where they grow to a variety\r\nknown as _Cysticercus racemosus_; next in frequency they are found in\r\nthe eye, in the muscular system, in the heart, in the subcutaneous\r\nconnective tissue, the liver, lungs, abdominal cavity, etc. The number\r\nof cysticerci observed in one man varies between a few and several\r\nthousands. Of the sexes, men are most subject (60 to 66 per cent. of\r\nthe number attacked). The disturbances caused in man by cysticerci\r\nvary according to the nature or position of the organs attacked; when\r\nsituated in the cerebral meninges they have the same effect as tumours.\r\n\r\n[289] Dressel, for instance, examined eighty-seven persons suffering\r\nfrom cysticercus, and found it seventy-two times in the brain, thirteen\r\ntimes in the muscles; K. Müller, in thirty-six cases, found it\r\ntwenty-one times in the brain, twelve times in the muscles, three times\r\nin the heart; Haugg, in twenty-five cases, found it thirteen times in\r\nthe brain, six times in the muscles, twice in the skin, etc. According\r\nto Graefe, amongst 1,000 ophthalmic cases in Halle and Berlin, there\r\nwas one with cysticercus in the eye; in Stuttgart there was only one in\r\n4,000, in Paris one in 6,000, and in Copenhagen one in 8,000.\r\n\r\nDuring the last decades, however, these cases have also become less\r\ncommon. In Rudolphi’s time 2 per cent. of _post-mortems_ in Berlin\r\nshowed cysticerci; in the ’sixties, according to Virchow, about the\r\nsame; in 1875 the number fell to 1·6 per cent.; in 1881 to 0·5 per\r\ncent.; in 1882 to 0·2 per cent.; in 1900 to 0·15 per cent., and in\r\n1903 to 0·16 per cent. Hirschberg between 1869 and 1885 discovered\r\ncysticerci in the eye seventy times in 60,000 ophthalmic cases, but\r\nduring the following six years the parasite was only present twice\r\namongst a total of 46,000 cases of ophthalmic diseases, and since 1895\r\nno ophthalmic case has been met with.\r\n\r\nThe infection of human beings with the cysticerci can only take place\r\nby the introduction of the oncospheres of _Tænia solium_ into the\r\nstomach with vegetable foods, salads that have been washed in impure\r\nwater containing oncospheres, also by drinking contaminated water;\r\nthe carriers of _T. solium_, moreover, infect themselves still more\r\nfrequently through uncleanliness in defæcation, the privies in public\r\nlocalities and many private houses affording striking testimony of\r\nthis. The minute oncospheres can thus easily reach the fingers and\r\nthence the mouth (as in twirling the moustache, biting the nail).\r\nMore rarely a third manner of transmission or internal auto-infection\r\nmay possibly take place, as when, in the act of vomiting, mature\r\nproglottids near the stomach are drawn into it; the oncospheres or\r\nsegments there retained are then in the same position as if they had\r\nbeen introduced through the mouth.\r\n\r\n  On account of these dangers of internal or external auto-infection,\r\n  it is therefore the duty of the medical attendant, after recognizing\r\n  the presence of tapeworms, to expel them,[290] and in doing so to\r\n  employ every possible means to prevent vomiting setting in; it is,\r\n  however, equally important to take the necessary steps to destroy the\r\n  parasites evacuated. It may be incidentally mentioned that in using\r\n  certain remedies the scolex not rarely remains in the intestine; the\r\n  cure in such cases has not been accomplished, as the scolex again\r\n  produces new proglottids, and after about eleven weeks the first\r\n  formed ones are again mature and appear in the fæces.\r\n\r\n[290] The diagnosis as a rule is not difficult; the patients themselves\r\nfrequently observe the pumpkin seed-like segments in the fæces. But in\r\nsuch cases the diagnosis must still be confirmed. In other cases the\r\ndiscovery of the oncospheres in their embryonal shells (embryophores),\r\nwhich cannot be confounded with the other constituents of the fæces,\r\ngives complete certainty, although the differential diagnosis between\r\n_T. solium_ and _T. saginata_ is hardly possible from the embryophores;\r\nbut, if evacuated segments are placed between two slides and lightly\r\npressed, the species is easily recognizable by the shape of the uterus\r\n(_cf._ figs. 239 and 241).\r\n\r\n  Amongst the cysticerci also many malformations appear; thus absence\r\n  of the rostellum and the hooks, or double formation with six suckers,\r\n  or abnormalities of growth on account of the surroundings, which have\r\n  had a special name given to them, _viz._, _Cysticercus racemosus_,\r\n  Zenk. (= _C. botryoides_, Hell.; _C. multilocularis_, Kchnmstr.);\r\n  these forms are more especially found at the base of the brain, are\r\n  irregularly ramified and often without the head.\r\n\r\nA certain interest is attached to those forms that have led to the\r\nestablishment of a distinct species:--\r\n\r\n\r\n*Cysticercus acanthotrias*, Weinld., 1858.\r\n\r\n  In making the autopsy of a white Virginian woman who had died of\r\n  phthisis, a cysticercus was found in the dura mater, and eleven or\r\n  twelve specimens in the muscles and subcutaneous tissue. Weinland\r\n  and Leuckart, who examined the specimens, found that they resembled\r\n  _Cysticercus cellulosæ_ in form and size, but that they carried on\r\n  the rostellum a triple crown, each consisting of fourteen to sixteen\r\n  hooks, which differed from the hooks of _C. cellulosæ_ or of _Tænia\r\n  solium_ by the greater length of the posterior root process and the\r\n  more slender form of the hooks; the large hooks measured 0·153 to\r\n  0·196 mm., the medium-sized hooks, 0·114 to 0·14 mm., and the small\r\n  ones 0·063 to 0·07 mm.\r\n\r\nOn account of these differences a distinct species of cysticercus was\r\nestablished, and this naturally presupposed a corresponding species\r\nof Tænia (_T. acanthotrias_, Lkt.); this could be done with justice\r\nso long as the case remained isolated, _i.e._, in America, as there\r\nwas the possibility of the corresponding Tænia being found. In this\r\nrespect, however, the position has changed; Delore first described a\r\ncysticercus the size of a nut from the biceps muscle of the arm of a\r\nsilk-worker in Lyons; according to Bertolis this specimen possessed\r\nhooks of three different sizes, the dimensions of which corresponded\r\nwith the figures given by Weinland and Leuckart; the correctness of\r\nthe diagnosis could hardly be doubted, as Bertolis was known to be a\r\nvery exact observer. A second case has become known through Cobbold,\r\nwho regards a specimen of a cysticercus in Dallinger’s collection as\r\nlikewise belonging to _Cysticercus acanthotrias_; this specimen also\r\ncame from a man’s brain; finally a third case, also from France, has\r\nbeen published by Redon. This author, amongst numerous _C. cellulosæ_\r\nof a man, found one that had forty-one hooks in three rows, and he\r\nwas the first to express the opinion that _C. acanthotrias_ does\r\nnot represent a distinct species, but is only an abnormality of _C.\r\ncellulosæ_. This view was also taken by Blanchard and Railliet, and is\r\nprobably correct, as the discovery of the large corresponding Tænia\r\nfurnished with three rows of hooks is not to be expected in European\r\nbeasts of prey, and in Redon’s case _C. acanthotrias_ as well as _C.\r\ncellulosæ_ occurred simultaneously.\r\n\r\nThe duration of life of _C. cellulosæ_ in man is very long; cysticerci\r\nof the eye have been known to persist for twenty years, and in\r\ncysticercus of the brain ten to nineteen years may elapse from the\r\nfirst appearance of cerebral symptoms until death. Dead cysticerci may\r\nshrivel up or become calcified, perhaps also undergo fatty degeneration\r\nand then absorption. Finally, it may be mentioned that if particular\r\nproof is required that _C. cellulosæ_ of man belongs to the cycle of\r\ndevelopment of the _Tænia solium_, such proof has been furnished by\r\nRedon.\r\n\r\n  NOTE.--_Tænia tenella_, mentioned on p. 332, was ascribed by Cobbold\r\n  to cysticerci of the muscular system of sheep. It has, however,\r\n  been demonstrated that these cysticerci belong to the cycle of\r\n  development of _Tænia marginata_ (dog) (_Cysticercus tenuicollis_,\r\n  from the omentum of sheep); but as already stated _C. cellulosæ_ also\r\n  occurs in sheep. Chatin himself swallowed the cysticercus, which\r\n  Cobbold termed _C. ovis_, without causing a Tænia to develop in his\r\n  intestine. Müller also vainly sought to induce infection with _C.\r\n  tenuicollis_ in his own person. On the other hand, the feeding of\r\n  a dog with _Cysticercus ovis_ resulted in the production of _Tænia\r\n  marginata_.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Tænia bremneri*, Stephens, 1908.\r\n\r\nCharacterized by the large size of the gravid segments. The largest was\r\n32 by 9 mm. Smallest 21 by 6 mm. Average 28·6 by 8·5 mm. Mode 21 by\r\n6 mm. Uterine branches twenty-two to twenty-four in number.

It attains 1·5 to 4 m.\r\n  in length, possesses a double crown of thirty to forty hooks, on\r\n  an average thirty-six to thirty-eight hooks, and in its larval\r\n  stage (_Cysticercus tenuicollis_) lives in the peritoneal cavity of\r\n  ruminants and the pig, occasionally in the monkey and squirrel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 240.--Large and small hooklets of _Tænia\r\nmarginata_. 280/1. (After Leuckart.)]\r\n\r\n  It is included in this work because, according to one statement,\r\n  _C. tenuicollis_ is supposed to have been observed in man in North\r\n  America; but the case is not quite certain, as the number of hooks\r\n  was less than in _C. tenuicollis_ and coincided with _C. cellulosæ_,\r\n  although the size of the cysticercus appeared to point to _C.\r\n  tenuicollis_. A yet earlier statement of Eschricht, that _Cysticercus\r\n  tenuicollis_ had been observed in Iceland in the liver of a man, is\r\n  undoubtedly due to an error.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Tænia serrata*, Goeze, 1782.\r\n\r\n  This parasite attains a length of from 0·5 to 2 m., possesses a\r\n  double crown of thirty-four to forty-eight (mostly forty) hooks. It\r\n  lives exclusively in the intestine of the dog, the corresponding\r\n  cysticercus (_Cysticercus pisiformis_) living in the mesentery of the\r\n  hare and rabbit. We mention this species with all reserve amongst\r\n  the parasites of man, because Vital states that he has observed it\r\n  twice in Constantine (Algeria) in human beings. The data, however,\r\n  are not sufficient to characterize the species. It is highly probable\r\n  that they relate to _Tænia solium_. Galli-Valerio even swallowed five\r\n  specimens of _Cysticercus pisiformis_, but without result.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Tænia crassicollis*, Rud., 1810.\r\n\r\n  I only mention this species from the intestine of the domestic cat\r\n  because Krabbe regards its occurrence in man as possible. It attains\r\n  a length of 60 cm. and is armed; its cysticercus (_Cysticercus\r\n  fasciolaris_) lives in the liver of mice and rats. In Jutland,\r\n  according to Krabbe, chopped-up mice (spread on bread) are eaten\r\n  raw, being a national remedy for retention of urine, and this custom\r\n  affords the possibility of the introduction of _C. fasciolaris_ into\r\n  the intestine of man (_Nord. med. Arkiv_, 1880, xii).\r\n\r\n\r\n*Tænia saginata*, Goeze, 1782.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Tænia solium_, L., 1767 (_pro parte_); _Tænia cucurbitina_,\r\n  Pallas, 1781 (p.p.); _Tænia inermis_, Brera, 1802.

According to Bérenger-Feraud it attains a length of\r\n74 m. (?) The head is cubical in shape, 1·5 to 2 mm. in diameter; the\r\nsuckers are hemispherical (0·8 mm.) and are frequently pigmented;\r\nthere is a sucker-like organ in place of the rostellum, and this also\r\nis frequently pigmented. The neck is moderately long and about half\r\nthe breadth of the head; the proglottids, the number of which averages\r\nmore than 1,000, gradually increase in size; the mature detached\r\nsegments are shaped exactly like pumpkin-seeds, and are about 16 to\r\n20 mm. in length and 4 to 7 mm. in breadth. The genital pores alternate\r\nirregularly and are situated somewhat behind the middle of the lateral\r\nmargin. There are twenty to thirty-five lateral branches at each side\r\nof the median trunk of the uterus, and these again ramify. The eggs\r\nare more or less globular, the egg-shell frequently remains intact and\r\ncarries one or two filaments; the embryonal shell (embryophore) is\r\nthick, radially striated, is transparent and oval; it is 30 µ to 40 µ\r\nin length, and 20 µ to 30 µ in breadth. Several segments simultaneously\r\nare usually passed spontaneously with defæcation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 241.--Mature segment of _Tænia saginata_, G., with\r\ndistended uterus. 2/1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 242.--Cephalic end of _Tænia saginata_ in the\r\ncontracted condition. 8/1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 243.--_Tænia saginata._ 19, egg with external\r\nshell. 20, without (embryophore). (After Leuckart.)]\r\n\r\n  Malformations are not uncommon, and resemble those of _Tænia solium_;\r\n  a triangular form has been termed _T. capensis_ by Küchenmeister, and\r\n  _T. lophosoma_ by Cobbold, names that naturally possess as little\r\n  value as does the term _T. fenestrata_ for fenestrated specimens.\r\n  Moreover, _T. solium_, var. _abietina_, Weinld., 1858, which was\r\n  evacuated by an Indian, was probably a _T. saginata_ with somewhat\r\n  close uterine branches. It is regarded by Stiles and Goldberger as a\r\n  doubtful subspecies.\r\n\r\n_T. saginata_ in its adult condition lives exclusively in the\r\nintestinal canal of man.[291] The corresponding cysticercus is\r\n_Cysticercus bovis_, and is found almost exclusively in the ox; it is\r\nsmall, 7·5 to 9 mm. in length and 5·5 mm. in breadth, may easily escape\r\nnotice, and requires from three to six months for its development.\r\nNumerous experiments have confirmed the connection of _Cysticercus\r\nbovis_ with _Tænia saginata_; indeed, the cysticercus was only\r\ndiscovered by feeding experiments after attention had been called to\r\nthe ox as the probable intermediary host of this Tænia.\r\n\r\n[291] Abnormal migrations of this species have also been known.\r\nCompare, amongst others, Stieda, A., “Durchbohr. d. Duod. u.\r\nd. Pancreas durch eine Tænia,” _Centralbl. f. Bakt., Path. und\r\nInfektionsk._, 1900, xxviii (1), p. 430.\r\n\r\n  Medical men observed that weakly children who were ordered to eat\r\n  raw scraped beef to strengthen them contracted _T. saginata_. It\r\n  was found, moreover, that Jews, who are prohibited from eating pork\r\n  from religious motives, suffered especially from _T. saginata_;\r\n  when _T. solium_ was found to occur in a Jew he often confessed to\r\n  having eaten pork; and finally it was found that certain nations--for\r\n  instance, the Abyssinians--frequently harbour _T. saginata_, and only\r\n  eat beef--raw by preference.\r\n\r\n  These observations led Leuckart, in 1861, to feed young calves\r\n  with the proglottids of _T. saginata_ in order to discover the\r\n  corresponding cysticercus, which was then not known. This experiment\r\n  was successful. Similar experiments, with similar results, were\r\n  then conducted by Mosler (1863), Cobbold and Simonds (1864 and\r\n  1872), Röll (1865), Gerlach (1870), Zürn (1872), Saint Cyr, Jolicœur\r\n  (1873), Masse and Pourquier (1876), and Perroncito, in 1876. The\r\n  attempts to infect goats, sheep, dogs, pigs, rabbits and monkeys were\r\n  unsuccessful. Only Zenker and Heller were able to infect kids, and\r\n  Heller infected one sheep, but these are exceptions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 244.--A piece of the muscle of the ox, with three\r\nspecimens of _Cysticercus bovis_. Natural size. (After Ostertag.)]\r\n\r\nArtificial infections of human beings with _Cysticercus bovis_ to\r\nobtain the tapeworm were less numerous, and indeed quite superfluous,\r\nyet this was also done by Oliver (1869) in India, and Perroncito (1877)\r\nin Italy. The experiments of the latter prove that the extracted\r\ncysticerci of the ox certainly perish in water at 47° to 48° C.\r\n\r\n  It is a remarkable circumstance that, at least as regards Central\r\n  Europe, _C. bovis_ in the ox, after natural infection, was so seldom\r\n  found that almost every case was published as a rarity; whereas the\r\n  Tænia is very frequent in man. The reason for this is that in Germany\r\n  cattle are not severely infected, and that the small, easily dried-up\r\n  cysticerci easily escape notice in the large body of the host.\r\n  Hertwig, the late director of the town cattle market in Berlin, in\r\n  1888, pointed out that the cysticercus of the ox is found chiefly in\r\n  the musculi pterygoide externi and interni, and since that time a far\r\n  greater number of infected oxen have been found in Berlin.\r\n\r\n    ---------+----------------+----------+------------\r\n      Year   | Number of oxen | Infected | Proportion\r\n             |  slaughtered   |          |\r\n    ---------+----------------+----------+------------\r\n     1888–89 |    141,814     |   113    |  1 : 1,255\r\n     1889–90 |    154,218     |   390    |  1 :   395\r\n     1890–91 |    124,593     |   263    |  1 :   474\r\n     1891–92 |    136,368     |   252    |  1 :   541\r\n     1892–93 |    142,874     |   214    |  1 :   672\r\n    ---------+----------------+----------+------------\r\n\r\n  Since 1892 an increase has taken place in the number of oxen infected\r\n  with cysticercus, but this is probably attributable to the more\r\n  general and searching examinations. In the slaughter-houses of\r\n  Prussia the number of infected beasts was as follows:--\r\n\r\n    1892      567\r\n    1893      686\r\n    1894      748\r\n    1895    1,143\r\n    1896    1,981\r\n    1897    2,629\r\n\r\n  The condition was most frequent in Neisse (3·2 to 4 per cent.),\r\n  Eisenach (1·91 per cent.), Ohlau (1·57 per cent.), Oels i. Schles.\r\n  (1 per cent.), Marienwerder (0·34 to 1·2 per cent.). The flesh of\r\n  oxen only slightly infected (containing not more than ten living\r\n  cysticerci) is sold in pieces of not more than 5 lb. to consumers\r\n  after having been rendered innocuous by cooking, or by pickling for\r\n  twenty-one days in 25 per cent. salt brine, or hanging for twenty-one\r\n  days in suitable refrigerators; oxen in which only one cysticercus is\r\n  found are allowed free commerce, and those strongly infected (_i.e._,\r\n  containing more than ten living cysticerci) may only be used for\r\n  industrial purposes.\r\n\r\n  It is a striking fact that more bulls than cows are infected\r\n  (according to Reissmann, in Berlin, from 1895 to 1902, 0·446 per\r\n  cent. bulls, 0·439 per cent. oxen, and 0·262 per cent. cows), the\r\n  explanation of which, according to Ostertag, is that most oxen are\r\n  killed when young, when also infection most readily takes place, and,\r\n  further, that the larva later on in life can be completely atrophied.\r\n\r\nThe cysticercus of the ox has hitherto been found in man on very rare\r\noccasions. Arndt (_Zeitschr. f. Psychiat._, xxiv) mentions a case in\r\nthe brain, Heller in the eye, and Nabiers and Dubreith also in the\r\nbrain (_Journ. méd. Bordeaux_, 1889–1890, p. 209); but the diagnoses\r\nare not quite certain, as absence of hooks occasionally occurs in\r\n_Cysticercus cellulosæ_.\r\n\r\n_Tænia saginata_ is the most frequent tapeworm of man (with the\r\nexception of _Dibothriocephalus latus_ in a few districts), and the\r\nparasite is widely distributed over the surface of the globe; it has\r\nbeen known in the East for ages, so far as data are available; it is\r\nfrequent in Africa, America, and Europe. Its frequency has perceptibly\r\nincreased during the last few years, but a decrease should soon take\r\nplace in consequence of the extent and improvement of the official\r\ninspection of meat.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the relative frequency of the Cestodes of\r\nman:--\r\n\r\n  ----------------+---------+----------+----------+-------+------+-------+--------\r\n                  |         |Number of |   _T.    |  _T.  |_Dibr.|_Dipyl.|Undeter-\r\n       Author     |  Year   |  cases   |saginata_ |solium_|latus_|canin._| mined\r\n  ----------------+---------+----------+----------+-------+------+-------+--------\r\n  Parona (Milan)  |  1899   |   150    |   121    |   11  |   4  |  --   |   14\r\n  Parona (Italy)  | 1868–99 |   513    |   397    |   71  |  26  |  --   |   19\r\n  Krabbe (Denmark)|  1869   |   100    |    37    |   53  |   9  |   1   |   --\r\n    \"        \"    | 1869–86 |   200    |   153    |   24  |  16  |   8   |   --\r\n    \"        \"    | 1887–95 |   100    |    89    |   --  |   5  |   6   |   --\r\n    \"        \"    |1896–1904|    50    |    41    |    1  |   5  |   3   |   --\r\n  Blanchard       |  1895   |     ?    | 1,000    |   21  |  --  |  --   |   --\r\n   (Paris)        |         |          |          |       |      |       |\r\n  Stiles          |  1895   |{more than|more than}|   --  |   3  |  --   |   --\r\n   (United States)|         |{  300    |   300   }|       |      |       |\r\n  Schoch          |  1869   |    19    |    16    |    1  |   2  |  --   |   --\r\n   (Switzerland)  |         |          |          |       |      |       |\r\n  Zaeslein        |  1881   |     ?    |   180    |   19  |   ?  |       |\r\n   (Switzerland)  |         |          |          |       |      |  --   |   --\r\n  Kessler         |  1888   |     ?    |    22    |   16  |  47  |  --   |   --\r\n   (Petrograd)    |         |          |          |       |      |       |\r\n  Mosler          |  1894   |   181    |   112    |   64  |   5  |  --   |   --\r\n   (Greifswald)   |         |          |          |       |      |       |\r\n  Bollinger       |  1885   |    25    |    16    |    1  |   8  |  --   |   --\r\n   (Munich)       |         |          |          |       |      |       |\r\n  Vierordt        |  1885   |   121    |   113    |    8  |  --  |  --   |   --\r\n   (Tübingen)     |         |          |          |       |      |       |\r\n  Mangold         | 1885–94 |   128    |   120    |    6  |   8  |  --   |   --\r\n   (Tübingen)     |         |          |          |       |      |       |\r\n  ----------------+---------+----------+----------+-------+------+-------+--------\r\n\r\n\r\n*Tænia africana*, v.

The ovary\r\nis in the middle, and behind it are the shell gland and vitellarium;\r\nat the sides are the testicles, and externally the excretory canals;\r\nthe cirrus pouch, the vas deferens and the vagina are on the left.\r\nMagnified. (After v. Linstow.)]\r\n\r\nThis worm measures over 1·3 m. in length. The segments are all broader\r\nthan they are long. The scolex is unarmed and is provided with an\r\napical sucker (0·16 mm.). The parasite measures 1·38 mm. in breadth,\r\n1·03 mm. in width; the suckers measure 0·63 mm. in diameter. The neck\r\nis very short and somewhat broader than the scolex; number of segments\r\nabout 600; the hindmost segments measure 7 mm. in length and 12 to\r\n15 mm. in breadth. The genital pores alternate irregularly in the\r\nmiddle of the lateral margin; the testes are very numerous and occupy\r\nthe entire medullary layer; the vas deferens is much convoluted; the\r\ncirrus pouch is pyriform and thick walled; the cirrus and vagina\r\nare beset with bristles directed outwards; the receptaculum seminis\r\nis fusiform; the ovary is large and double, and consists of radially\r\nplaced club-shaped tubes that do not anastomose and do not branch;\r\nthe vitellarium is at the posterior border of the proglottids, the\r\nround shell gland in front of it; the uterus consists of a median\r\ntrunk and fifteen to twenty-four non-ramified lateral branches on each\r\nside; the embryonal shell is thick and has radial stripes--it may be\r\nround (31·2 µ to 33·8 µ) or oval (39 µ, by 33·8 µ); the spines of the\r\noncospheres measure 7 µ to 8 µ in length (fig. 197).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 246.--Proglottis of _Tænia africana_, with uterus.\r\nMagnified.

Linstow.)]\r\n\r\nAt present only two specimens are known; they came from a black soldier\r\nfrom the vicinity of Lake Nyasa. The cysticercus is unknown; perhaps it\r\nlives in the zebu, the flesh of which the Askaris are in the habit of\r\ndevouring uncooked.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Tænia confusa*, Ward, 1896.\r\n\r\nLength 8·5 m., breadth about 5 mm. The scolex is unknown; there is\r\nno neck; number of proglottids 700 to 800, always longer than they\r\nare broad; the hindmost measure 35 mm. in length, 4 to 5 mm. in\r\nbreadth; the genital pores alternate irregularly behind the middle\r\nof the lateral margin; testicles numerous; vas deferens not much\r\ncoiled; the cirrus pouch thick walled, elongated and club-shaped, with\r\nglobular vesicula seminalis; the cirrus is beset with little hairs;\r\nthe receptaculum seminis is globular; ovary small, double; each half\r\nis bean-shaped; vitellarium narrow, triangular; shell gland globular;\r\nuterus with median trunk and fourteen to eighteen short ramified\r\nlateral branches on either side. The embryophores are oval (39 µ by\r\n30 µ), thick and radially striated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 248.--_Tænia confusa_: mature segment showing\r\ncentral uterine stem, bilobed ovary, globular shell gland, triangular\r\nvitellarium, scattered testes, cirrus, vas deferens, and vagina. 15/1.\r\n(After Guyer.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 249.--_Tænia confusa_: gravid segment. 25/1. (After\r\nWard.)]\r\n\r\nOf this species only two specimens have been recorded; they occurred in\r\nhuman beings and were sent at different times to the first describer\r\nof them by a doctor in Lincoln (Nebr.). Perhaps _Tænia solium_, var.\r\n_abietina_, Weinld., which was found in a Chipeway Indian, is of the\r\nsame species in spite of the shorter segments.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Tænia echinococcus*, v. Sieb., 1853.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Tænia nana_, v. Ben., 1861 (_nec_ v. Sieb., 1853);\r\n  _Echinococcifer echinococcus_, Weinld., 1861.\r\n\r\n_Tænia echinococcus_ measures 2·5 to 5 or 6 mm. in length; the head\r\nis 0·3 mm. in breadth, and has a double row of twenty-eight to fifty\r\nhooklets (on an average thirty-six to thirty-eight) on the rostellum.\r\n\r\nThe size and form of these hooklets vary (the larger ones are 0·040\r\nto 0·045 mm. in length, the smaller ones are 0·030 to 0·038 mm. in\r\nlength). The suckers measure 0·13 mm. in diameter; the neck is short;\r\nthere are only three or four segments, the posterior segment being\r\nabout 2 mm. in length and 0·5 mm. in breadth. The genital pores\r\nalternate; there are forty to fifty testicles; the vas deferens\r\nis spirally coiled; the cirrus pouch is pyriform. The ovary is\r\nhorseshoe-shaped with the concavity directed backwards; the vitellarium\r\ndouble, each half almost bean-shaped, at right angles to the plane of\r\nthe segment; the shell gland is round. The median trunk of the uterus\r\nis dilated when filled with eggs and (instead of lateral branches)\r\nhas lateral diverticula. It is not unusual for the eggs to form local\r\nheaps. The embryonal shell (embryophore) is moderately thin, with\r\nradial striæ, almost globular, 30 µ to 36 µ in diameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 250.--_Tænia echinococcus_: the cirrus sac, the\r\nvagina, uterus, ovary, shell gland and vitellarium, and the testicles\r\nat the sides are recognizable in the second proglottis; the posterior\r\nproglottis shows the uterus partly filled with eggs, as well as the\r\ncirrus sac and the vagina. 50/1.]\r\n\r\nWhen mature this parasite lives in the small intestine of the domestic\r\ndog, the jackal, and the wolf, and apparently also in _Felis concolor_,\r\nand is usually present in great numbers; it can also be transmitted\r\nexperimentally to the domestic cat, one successful result out of seven\r\n(Dévé).[292] The larval stage (_Echinococcus polymorphus_) lives in\r\nvarious organs--chiefly in the liver and lungs--of numerous species\r\nof mammals (twenty-seven), especially in sheep, ox and pig, and it is\r\neven not uncommon in man, though the Tænia itself has never been found\r\nin a human being; accordingly man can only acquire the echinococcus by\r\ningesting the eggs of the “dog worm.” The dogs disseminate the eggs of\r\n_Tænia echinococcus_ wherever they go, or carry them to their mouths\r\nand coats by biting up the evacuated segments, and are thus able to\r\ntransmit them directly to human beings (by licking them or making use\r\nof the same crockery, etc.). In other cases the oncospheres, enclosed\r\nin the embryophores, must withstand desiccation for a time and then (as\r\nwhen the dogs are “kissed” or otherwise caressed) are transmitted into\r\nor on to man. As echinococcus disease in man is always very dangerous,\r\nit would be a matter of general interest to prevent dogs being\r\ninfected by destroying the echinococci,[293] and all measures would be\r\njustifiable which would diminish the superfluous number of house-dogs\r\n(for instance, high taxes); measures should also be adopted to limit\r\nthe association of men with dogs, particularly in such frequented\r\nplaces as restaurants, railway carriages and tram-cars.\r\n\r\n[292] In Iceland 28 per cent. of the dogs are infected with this Tænia,\r\nin Lyons 7·1 per cent., in Zurich 3·9 per cent., in Berlin 1 per cent.,\r\nand in Copenhagen 0·4 per cent. In Australia even 40 to 50 per cent. of\r\nthe dogs are affected. It is, however, a question whether, in addition\r\nto _Tænia echinococcus_, a second analogous form is not involved, as\r\nthe form from _Canis dingo_ attains a length of 10 to 30 mm.\r\n\r\n[293] Mosler, F., “Ueb.

Hungarian pigs, and 13·09 per cent. of sheep were infected\r\n  with echinococcus; at the same time it was stated that in regard\r\n  to the native pigs the liver was more frequently affected than the\r\n  lungs (3·81 per cent. as compared with 0·26 per cent.); in sheep the\r\n  lungs were more frequently infected (12·71 per cent. to 3·73 per\r\n  cent.), whereas in the Hungarian pigs both organs were almost equally\r\n  infected (14·78 per cent. to 12·03 per cent.).\r\n\r\n  The data of Lichtenheld, in Leipzig, give the frequency with which\r\n  various organs were affected, as shown in the following table:--\r\n\r\n  -----------+---------+-------------------+---------+---------\r\n             | Cattle  |       Pigs        |  Sheep  | Horses\r\n  -----------+---------+-------------------+---------+---------\r\n             |         |    ♂    |    ♀    |         |\r\n             |per cent.|per cent.|per cent.|per cent.|per cent.\r\n  Lungs      |  69·3   |  16·2   |  21·4   |  52·2   |   5·5\r\n  Liver      |  27·0   |  74·2   |  72·0   |  44·9   |  94·5\r\n  Spleen     |   2·2   |   3·2   |   2·7   |   2·9   |   --\r\n  Heart      |   0·75  |   3·2   |   1·3   |   --    |   --\r\n  Kidneys    |   0·75  |   3·2   |   1·3   |   --    |   --\r\n  Sub-       |         |         |         |         |\r\n   peritoneal|         |         |         |         |\r\n   tissue    |   --    |   --    |   1·3   |   --    |   --\r\n  -----------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF ECHINOCOCCUS (HYDATID).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 251.--_Echinococcus veterinorum_: the fibrous sac\r\nenclosing the echinococcus has been opened and laid back in five parts,\r\nso that the surface of the bladder worm may be seen, with the brood\r\ncapsules, visible to the naked eye, showing through it. Natural size.\r\n(After Leuckart.)]\r\n\r\nAn echinococcus is a spherical or roundish bladder full of a watery\r\nliquid, which originates by liquefaction of the oncosphere, and in man\r\nmay attain the size of a child’s head, but remains smaller in cattle\r\n(the size of an orange or apple). The thin wall of the bladder is\r\ncomposed of an external laminated cuticle (ectocyst) and an internal\r\ngerminal or parenchymatous layer (endocyst). The latter again exhibits\r\ntwo layers: an outer layer of small cells that are less sharply\r\ndefined, and an inner layer of larger cells. It contains, in addition,\r\ncalcareous corpuscles, muscular fibres and excretory vessels. It is\r\nrich in glycogen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 252.\r\n\r\nFIGS. 252 and 252A.--Diagrams of mode of formation of brood capsule and\r\nscolices. (1) Wall of mother cyst, consisting of ectocyst and endocyst;\r\n(2) theoretical stage of invagination of wall; (3) a brood capsule with\r\nthe layers of the wall in the reverse position to that in the mother\r\ncyst; (4) evagination of wall; (5) invagination; (6) fusion to form the\r\nsolid scolex; (7) invagination of fore-part of scolex into hind-part.\r\n(_Note._--The size of the scolex is much out of proportion to the brood\r\ncapsule.) (Stephens.)]\r\n\r\nThe development in cattle often remains stationary at the bladder\r\nstage, and they are then called “acephalocysts,” or _Echinococcus\r\ncysticus sterilis_. According to Lichtenheld, sterile cysts occur in\r\n80 per cent. of cases in cattle, in 20 per cent. in pigs, and in 7·5\r\nper cent. in sheep. In other cases large numbers of small, hollow\r\nBROOD CAPSULES are formed in the germ layer, but are not arranged in\r\nany particular order. The order of the layers is just the reverse\r\nin them to what it is in the parent cyst, that is to say, they have\r\ninside a thin non-laminated cuticle and the parenchymatous layer on\r\ntheir external surface. These, theoretically at least, may be regarded\r\nas invaginations of the bladder wall giving rise to a cavity with the\r\ncuticle internal and the parenchymatous layer external. If we suppose\r\nthe orifice to close, we should then get an isolated cavity with\r\ncuticle internal and parenchymatous layer external, as in the brood\r\ncapsule (fig. 252). If we next suppose an evagination of the wall of\r\nthe brood capsule to occur at one point we should get a hollow process\r\n_lined_ with cuticle; at the bottom of this we get the scolex and\r\nhooklets formed, and a little higher up the tube the suckers (fig. 252,\r\n4). If this hollow scolex is now pictured as being invaginated we get\r\na hollow scolex _covered_ with cuticle and lined by a parenchymatous\r\nlayer projecting into the cavity of the brood capsule. The two sides of\r\nthis hollow scolex now fuse and we get a solid scolex projecting into\r\nthe cavity. Finally, if we imagine once more the rostellum and suckers\r\ninvaginated into the posterior part of the scolex we get the condition\r\nas frequently found in the brood capsules, _i.e._, a scolex covered\r\nwith cuticle projecting into the cavity, with the rostellum and suckers\r\ninvaginated into the posterior portion of the scolex (fig. 252A, 7).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 252A.]\r\n\r\nA large hydatid may contain many thousands of brood capsules. Each\r\nbrood capsule is about as big as a pin’s head, and may contain ten to\r\nthirty or more scolices. The delicate wall of the brood capsules may\r\nrupture, so that the scolices are now free in the mother cyst. These\r\nfree scolices and also free brood capsules constitute what is known as\r\n“hydatid sand,” which settles at the bottom of a glass when hydatid\r\nfluid is poured into it. This form occurs chiefly in domesticated\r\nanimals and is termed _E. veterinorum_, Rud., or _E. cysticus fertilis_.\r\n\r\nIn man, and only rarely in cattle, the mother cyst first forms\r\n“daughter cysts” (_E. hominis_, Rud. [fig. 255]), which, though smaller\r\nthan the “mother cyst,” resemble it in the structure of their walls;\r\nthus they are covered externally by a laminated cuticle and internally\r\nby the parenchymatous layer. They originate:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 253.--Section through an invaginated echinococcus\r\nscolex. _Cf._ fig. 252A, 7. × 300. (After Dévé.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 254.--A piece of the wall of an _Echinococcus\r\nveterinorum_ stretched out and seen from the internal surface.

In the latter case they lie between the mother\r\ncyst and the capsule of connective tissue formed by the host (_E.\r\ngranulosus_ or _E. hydatidosus exogenus_); when growing inwardly they\r\nreach the interior of the mother cyst (_E. hydatidosus endogenus_).\r\nTheir number is very variable and does not depend on the size of the\r\nmother cyst. They are as big as, or bigger than, gooseberries.\r\n\r\n(2) According to some authors, endogenous daughter cysts arise also\r\nfrom a _metamorphosis of scolices_ that have separated off from the\r\nbrood capsule. This takes place in the following way: Fluid accumulates\r\nin the interior of the scolex, so that eventually nothing remains\r\nexcept a sac consisting of cuticle lined by parenchyma. The cuticle\r\ngradually thickens and several layers form (fig. 257).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 255.--_Echinococcus hominis_ in the liver.

(After Dévé.)]\r\n\r\n(3) _Transformation of Brood Capsules into Daughter Cysts._--This is\r\nalso held to be possible by various observers. New epithelial layers\r\nare deposited between the cuticle which lines the brood capsule and\r\nthe outer parenchymatous layer. This parenchymatous layer gradually\r\ndisappears and a new parenchymatous layer forms in the interior from\r\nthe parenchyma of the scolex or scolices. Although it appears strange\r\nthat a completely formed scolex with specifically differentiated\r\ntissues and organs should retrogress to more primitively organized\r\nmatter, and again become a proliferating bladder, yet we can hardly\r\ndoubt that the older observations, regarding such a vesicular\r\nmetamorphosis, of Bremser (1819), v. Siebold (1837), Naunyn (1862),\r\nRasmusser (1866), Leuckart (1881), Alexinsky (1898), Riemann (1899),\r\nDévé (1901), and Perroncito (1902) are correct.\r\n\r\n(4) Further, _a fourth method_ of formation of daughter cysts is\r\ndescribed by Naunyn as occurring in sterile hydatids, _i.e._, those\r\ncontaining no brood capsules. In this case a portion of the mother wall\r\nof the hydatid gets constricted off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 257.\r\n\r\nFigs. _257_ and 257A.--Diagram of transformation of a scolex into a\r\ndaughter cyst (1 to 3): 1, scolex in brood capsule; 2, liquefaction\r\nof scolex; 3, daughter cyst; and (4 to 6) of a brood capsule into\r\na daughter cyst; 4, brood capsule with scolex; 5, deposition of\r\nnew epithelial layers on the inner layer of the parenchyma; 6,\r\ndisappearance of outer parenchyma and formation of inner parenchyma\r\nfrom the parenchyma of scolex, which has now disappeared. (_Note._--The\r\nscolices are out of proportion to the brood capsules and to the\r\ndaughter cysts. Stephens.)]\r\n\r\nIt has also been established that not only daughter cysts transplanted\r\ninto animals develop further (Lebedeff, Andrejew, Stadnitzky,\r\nAlexinsky, Riemann), but that this also holds good if only hydatid\r\n_scolices_ from man or animals are transplanted into animals\r\n(rabbits). They develop into echinococci and can then give rise to\r\nbrood capsules and scolices. As Dévé further established, hydatid\r\n_scolices_ are not capable of developing in guinea-pigs, while\r\ncorresponding experiments with rabbits are in the large majority of\r\ncases successful where the scolices are introduced subcutaneously\r\nor into the pleural or peritoneal cavities. It is only in the case\r\nof _daughter cysts_ that further growth is obtained in the case of\r\nguinea-pigs. Finally it appears, as has been already stated, that brood\r\ncapsules can transform themselves into daughter cysts, but according to\r\nDévé only within the mother cyst, not after transplantation. Daughter\r\ncysts that have been formed in the mother cyst of man and animals\r\nbehave themselves just as the mother cyst does, _i.e._, they can remain\r\nsterile, or give rise to brood capsules and scolices, or even again\r\nto fresh cysts--granddaughter cysts. The mother cyst can also die, so\r\nthat the daughter cysts then lie in the cavity of the connective tissue\r\ncapsule. The number of the daughter cysts in either case may attain\r\nseveral thousands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 257A.]\r\n\r\n  The echinococcus fluid, which originally is formed from the blood\r\n  of the host, is light yellow, with a neutral or slightly acid\r\n  reaction; its specific gravity averages 1009 to 1015. It contains\r\n  about 1·5 per cent. of inorganic salts, half of which is common salt;\r\n  in addition (besides water) it contains sugar, inosite, leucine,\r\n  tyrosin, succinic acid (associated with lime or soda) and albumens\r\n  which are not coagulated by heat; occasionally also the fluid has\r\n  been found to contain hæmatoidin and uric acid salts (in echinococcus\r\n  of the kidneys), which doubtless demonstrates that the echinococcus\r\n  liquid originates from the host. It has been generally assumed that\r\n  echinococcus fluid contains a toxic substance the escape of which\r\n  into the body cavity (at operation or by bursting of a hydatid\r\n  cyst) produces more or less severe symptoms (fever, peritonitis,\r\n  urticaria), so much so that one speaks of hydatid intoxication. The\r\n  investigations of Kobert, Joest, etc., have, however, shown the\r\n  harmlessness of fresh undecomposed hydatid and cysticercus fluid for\r\n  rabbits, mice and guinea-pigs, whether inoculated intraperitoneally,\r\n  subcutaneously or intravenously. Contrary data or clinical experience\r\n  must accordingly depend on other factors.\r\n\r\nAccording to the researches of Leuckart, the growth of the echinococcus\r\nis very slow; four weeks after infection the average size is only 0·25\r\nto 0·35 mm., at the age of eight weeks it is 1 to 2·5 mm., and at this\r\nperiod the formation of the central cavity commences; at the age of\r\nfive months, and with a size of 15 to 20 mm., the first brood capsules\r\nwith scolices are formed. The consequence of this gradual increase of\r\nsize is that the organ attacked can maintain its functions by vicarious\r\nhypertrophy, and that many echinococci induce no special symptoms and\r\ncannot even be diagnosed, the latter circumstance being due to their\r\nhidden position.\r\n\r\nThe echinococcus cannot be said to be scarce in man, as is shown by the\r\nfollowing table for Central Europe:--\r\n\r\n  --------------------+-------+--------------+------------+----------\r\n         Place        |       |    No. of    |No. of cases|Percentage\r\n                      |Period |_post-mortems_| of echino. |\r\n  --------------------+-------+--------------+------------+----------\r\n  Rostock             |1861–83|     1,026    |     25     |   2·43\r\n  Greifswald          |1862–93|     3,429    |     51     |   1·48\r\n  Jena                |1866–87|     4,998    |     42     |   0·84\r\n  Breslau             |1866–76|     5,128    |     39     |   0·761\r\n  Berlin              |1859–68|     4,770    |     33     |   0·69\r\n  Würzburg            |   --  |     2,280    |     11     |   0·48\r\n  Göttingen           |   --  |       639    |      3     |   0·469\r\n  Dresden             |1852–62|     1,939    |      7     |   0·36\r\n  Münich              |1854–87|    14,183    |     35     |   0·25\r\n  Vienna              |  1860 |     1,229    |      3     |   0·24\r\n  Prague              |   --  |     1,287    |      3     |   0·23\r\n  Kiel                |1872–87|     3,581    |      7     |   0·19\r\n  Zürich, Basle, Berne|   --  |     7,982    |     11     |   0·13\r\n  Erlangen            |1862–73|     1,755    |      2     |   0·11\r\n  --------------------+-------+--------------+------------+----------\r\n\r\nThese, however, are only cases that have become known by _post-mortem_;\r\nin addition, there are cases that have been treated medically, of which\r\nthere are a few statements, at all events relating to the principal\r\ndistricts of Germany. According to Madelung, one case of echinococcus\r\noccurs in every 1,056 inhabitants in the town of Rostock, in the\r\ndistrict of Rostock one to every 1,283, in Schwerin one to every 5,887,\r\nand in Ludwigsort one to every 23,685; according to Peiper, in Upper\r\nPomerania one case occurs to every 3,336, in the district of Greifswald\r\none to every 1,535 inhabitants. The northern districts of Pomerania are\r\nmore affected than the southern ones.\r\n\r\n  Accordingly, echinococcus is also considerably more frequent in\r\n  cattle in Pomerania. On an average in Germany 10·39 per cent. oxen,\r\n  9·83 per cent. sheep, and 6·47 per cent. pigs are infected, whereas\r\n  in Upper Pomerania 37·73 per cent. oxen, 27·1 per cent. sheep, and\r\n  12·8 per cent. pigs are infected; in Greifswald, indeed, 64·58 per\r\n  cent. oxen, 51·02 per cent. sheep, but only 4·93 per cent. pigs are\r\n  infected. In accordance with these figures _Tænia echinococcus_ must\r\n  be frequent in dogs in Pomerania, especially in Upper Pomerania; on\r\n  the other hand, the conjecture that the frequency of echinococcus in\r\n  Mecklenburg is explained by the occurrence of _Tænia echinococcus_ in\r\n  foxes has not been confirmed, as the fox does not harbour this worm\r\n  in Mecklenburg.\r\n\r\nBeyond the European continent, echinococcus is frequent in the\r\ninhabitants of Iceland, Argentine, Paraguay and Australia. In Iceland,\r\naccording to Finsen, 1 in every 43 inhabitants is affected with\r\nechinococcus; according to Jonassen the proportion is 1 to 63; this\r\nis due to the habits of the people of Iceland or, in fact, to the\r\nfrequency of _Tænia echinococcus_ in dogs, and the prevalence of the\r\nhydatid in cattle. In certain districts of Australia it is just as\r\nfrequent. In Cape Colony, Egypt and Algeria echinococcus is not rare,\r\nbut it is scarce in America and in Asia, with the exception of the\r\nnomadic tribes of Lake Baikal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 258.--Hooklets of echinococcus. _a_, of\r\n_Echinococcus veterinorum_; _b_, of _Tænia echinococcus_, three weeks\r\nafter infection; _c_, of the adult _Tænia echinococcus_; _d_, the\r\nthree forms of hooklets outlined one within the other. 600/1. (After\r\nLeuckart.)]\r\n\r\nEchinococcus attacks persons of every age, though it is rare in\r\nchildren up to 10 years of age and in old people. It occurs most\r\nfrequently between the ages of 21 and 40 years. According to all\r\nstatistics it preponderates in women (about two-thirds of the cases).\r\nThe liver is its favourite seat (57·1 per cent. of the cases); next\r\nin order come the lungs (8 per cent.), kidneys (6 per cent.), cranial\r\ncavity, genitalia, organs of circulation, spleen (3·8 per cent.), etc.\r\nAs a rule one organ only is invaded; multiple occurrence may originate\r\nfrom one infection, or eventually from a later infection (?), or it may\r\ncome to pass that from some cause (through the spontaneous rupture of\r\nan echinococcus, or the rupture of one caused by an injury or surgical\r\noperation) daughter cysts, brood capsules or scolices escape into the\r\nabdominal cavity,[294] where they settle or become transformed and\r\ngo on growing. In the distribution of this secondary echinococcus\r\nthe great powers of motility of the free scolices must be taken into\r\naccount (Sabrazès, Muratet, and Husnot).\r\n\r\n[294] In such cases the toxic effects of the echinococcus fluid\r\nusually--if not always--manifest themselves. Such effects are\r\nmanifested by severe symptoms of poisoning being set up, by urticaria,\r\nperitonitis, and ascites, and not infrequently they cause a fatal\r\ntermination.\r\n\r\n  Human echinococci may also die at various stages of development,\r\n  become caseous or calcified, or may be absorbed, the cause for this\r\n  being either disease of the hydatid itself or inflammation of its\r\n  connective tissue capsule; the discovery of the laminated cuticle,\r\n  which has great powers of resistance, or the finding of the hooklets\r\n  of the scolices is sufficient to form a conclusion as to the nature\r\n  of such formations.\r\n\r\nSiebold (1853) was the first to rear _Tænia echinococcus_ in the dog\r\nby feeding it with the echinococcus of cattle and especially of sheep.\r\nKüchenmeister, van Beneden, Leuckart, Railliet and others obtained\r\nsimilar results, and Thomas, Naunyn, Krabbe and Finsen succeeded in\r\nrearing _T. echinococcus_ in dogs from the bladder worms of human\r\nbeings; these grow comparatively slowly (one to three months[295])\r\nand only during the process of growth develop their hooklets in their\r\ndefinite form (fig. 258). It lies in the nature of things that dogs,\r\nwhether experimentally or naturally infected, almost always harbour\r\n_T. echinococcus_ in large quantities. That cats exceptionally harbour\r\nthese worms has been already mentioned (Dévé). Finally, Leuckart\r\ninfected young pigs by feeding them with mature segments.\r\n\r\n[295] According to Perroncito the scolices had not formed proglottids\r\nnine days after feeding, but the latter were present twenty-four days\r\nafter feeding, although the formation of eggs had not begun.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Echinococcus multilocularis* (alveolar colloid).\r\n\r\nIn addition to the form of echinococcus already described, and which is\r\nalso frequently termed _Echinococcus unilocularis_, there is a second\r\nform which occurs in man as well as in animals, and which is termed _E.\r\nmultilocularis_, s. _alveolaris_ (alveolar colloid).\r\n\r\nIt was originally regarded as a tumour; its animal nature was first\r\nestablished by Zeller and R. Virchow. The parasite, which varies in\r\nsize from that of a fist to a child’s head, presents a collection\r\nof numerous cysts, measuring between 0·1 and 3 to 4 mm. to 5 mm. in\r\ndiameter, which are embedded at first in a soft, connective tissue\r\nstroma; the cut surface has therefore a honeycomb appearance. The cysts\r\nare surrounded by a pellucid and laminated cuticle, and each according\r\nto its size encloses either a small-celled tissue or a cavity lined by\r\na parenchymatous layer; the fluid contained in such a cavity may be\r\ntransparent, or is rendered opaque by globules of fat, bile-pigment,\r\nhæmatoidin and fat crystals. According to some authors all or most of\r\nthese cysts intercommunicate; others state that this is the case at\r\nleast as regards the cuticle. The scolices are by no means found in\r\nall the cysts, and when present only a few, rarely half, of the cysts\r\ncontain scolices (one or more); it is supposed that at least some of\r\nthese scolices are formed in brood capsules, and that the former are\r\ncapable of undergoing a cystic metamorphosis.\r\n\r\nOne circumstance is peculiar to the multilocular echinococcus of man,\r\nnamely, the disintegration that sets in at certain stages; in the\r\ncentre of the parasite a cavity forms that frequently becomes very\r\nlarge and is filled with a purulent or brownish or brownish-green\r\nviscid fluid; in this fluid one finds shreds of the wall of the\r\ncavity, calcareous bodies, echinococcus cysts, also scolices and\r\nhooklets, as well as fat globules and crystals of hæmatoidin,\r\nmargarine and cholesterin and concretions of lime. Such ulcerative\r\nprocesses, according to Ostertag, are never present in the multilocular\r\nechinococcus of oxen,[296] in which the separate cysts are larger and\r\nthe connective tissue integument less powerfully developed.\r\n\r\n[296] This may perhaps be explained by the fact that the hosts are\r\nslaughtered before the parasites have attained the size or other\r\nconditions necessary to disintegration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 259.--_Echinococcus multilocularis_ in the liver of\r\nthe ox. Natural size. (After Ostertag.)]\r\n\r\nHardly anything positive is known with regard to the development of\r\nthe alveolar echinococcus; its peculiar conformation is attributed by\r\nsome to enormous infection of oncospheres, by others to the abnormal\r\nsituation of one oncosphere; a few authors ascribe it to infection\r\nof lymphatic vessels, others to infection of the biliary ducts or to\r\npeculiarities of the surrounding hepatic tissue; Leuckart ascribes it\r\nto a grape-like variety of form which continues budding; a few more\r\nrecent authors consider multilocular echinococcus to be specifically\r\ndifferent from unilocular echinococcus, and therefore also different\r\nthe species of Tænia arising from them. Melnikow-Raswedenkow is also\r\nof this opinion. According to this author the oncospheres infect\r\nthe lumen of a branch of the portal vein in Glisson’s capsule of\r\nthe liver and grow into an irregularly shaped formation (chitinous\r\ncoil), which breaks through the vascular walls and thus forms the\r\nalveoli. So far the data coincide well with Leuckart’s opinion of\r\nthe original grape-like form of the _Echinococcus multilocularis_;\r\naccording to Melnikow-Raswedenkow the “granular protoplasmic\r\nsubstance” (parenchymatous layer) is not only present in the interior\r\nof the loculi but also outside, and, moreover, “ovoid embryos”\r\nare supposed to develop in the chitinous coils, which, “thanks to\r\ntheir amœboid movements, reach the lumen of a vessel, where, under\r\nfavourable circumstances, they begin to develop further,” that is to\r\nsay, they become “chitinous cysts with fantastic outlines,” or also\r\n“single-chambered chitinous cysts”; scolices may develop in both. Dévé,\r\nhowever, considers that these embryos are only prolongations of the\r\nprotoplasmic layer which secondarily cuticularize.\r\n\r\n  The multilocular echinococcus, which in man produces a severe disease\r\n  and almost always leads to premature death, infects most frequently\r\n  the liver, but may also be found primarily in the brain, the spleen\r\n  and the suprarenal capsule; from the liver by means of metastasis it\r\n  may reach the most various organs, especially those of the abdomen,\r\n  but also the lungs, the heart, etc. Up to 1902, 235 cases have been\r\n  described and up to 1906, 265, being 70 from Russia, 56 from Bavaria,\r\n  32 from Switzerland, 30 from the Austrian Alps, 25 from Würtemberg;\r\n  the remaining cases are distributed over Central Germany, Baden,\r\n  Alsace, France, Upper Italy, North America. In some the origin is\r\n  doubtful; in any case after Russia, the mountainous South of Europe\r\n  is the principal region of distribution. As to the domesticated\r\n  animals, the same parasite is found principally in the ox (according\r\n  to Meyer, in Leipzig, in 7 per cent. of the oxen affected with\r\n  echinococcus); it is rarer in the sheep and very scarce in the pig.\r\n\r\nIt has already been mentioned above that recently the multilocular\r\nechinococcus has been stated to be specifically different from hydatid\r\nor unilocular echinococcus. To this may be added the fact that\r\nMangold, who fed a young pig with oncospheres of a Tænia reared from\r\nthe multilocular echinococcus, found two growths in the liver four\r\nmonths later, which he took to be _E. multilocularis_, and consequently\r\none has to assume the existence of two different worms. The chief\r\ndefender of this view, already put forward by Vogler, Mangold, and\r\nMüller, is Possett. He bases his opinions on (1) the more restricted\r\ndistribution of the multilocular hydatid, the former occurring in\r\ndistricts where only cattle are raised, the latter where sheep-breeding\r\nis established; (2) that those engaged in looking after sheep are\r\nattacked by multilocular, whereas those looking after cattle are\r\nattacked by unilocular hydatid; (3) that among the cases of unilocular\r\nhydatid occurring in the distribution areas of multilocular hydatid no\r\ntransitions between the two forms are observed; (4) on the difference\r\nin the hooks both in the hydatid as well as in the Tænia stage; the\r\nhooks of _Tænia echinococcus_ are plump, sharply curved, and have a\r\nshort posterior root process the length of which is to that of the\r\ntotal length as 1 to 4·7, whereas on the contrary the hooks of the\r\nalveolar echinococcus are more slender, slightly bent, and have a long\r\nposterior root process (1 to 2·5); and (5) on the form of the uterus,\r\nwhich in the alveolar Tænia has the form of a spherically distended sac\r\nanteriorly.\r\n\r\n\r\nSERUM DIAGNOSIS OF ECHINOCOCCUS.\r\n\r\n(1) _Precipitin Reaction._--Mix equal parts of hydatid fluid (of\r\nthe sheep) and serum of patient.

STEPHENS, M.D., B.C., D.P.H.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Bilaterally symmetrical animals, without limbs and with a body\r\n  cavity in which the gut or other organs float. They are generally\r\n  cylindrical.\r\n\r\n\r\nClass. *NEMATODA.*\r\n\r\n  Nemathelminthes with an alimentary canal.\r\n\r\n  Nematodes are as a rule elongated round worms of a filiform or\r\n  fusiform shape; their length varies according to the species from\r\n  about 1 mm. to 40 to 80 cm. The outer surface of the body is\r\n  smooth or annulated, and at certain points provided with papillæ,\r\n  occasionally also with bristles and alar appendages. The anterior end\r\n  carrying the oral aperture is usually rather slender, occasionally\r\n  quite thin; the posterior end is pointed or rounded; the anus, as a\r\n  rule, lies somewhat in front of the posterior extremity. The sexes\r\n  are almost always separate, and the male can as a rule be easily\r\n  distinguished from the female because the former is smaller and\r\n  more slender, its posterior extremity is often spiral or incurved,\r\n  or carries an alar appendage, whereas the female is larger and\r\n  thicker, and its posterior extremity is straight. In the male the\r\n  genitalia open into the anus; the sexual orifice of the female opens\r\n  ventrally along the median line in the anterior half of the body,\r\n  in the middle, or a little further back. Both sexes, moreover, have\r\n  an orifice, the excretory pore, which is situated ventrally in the\r\n  median line and about the level of the œsophageal nerve ring.\r\n\r\n  In large species, even with the naked eye, two lighter transparent\r\n  bands--the lateral lines--may be distinguished; they run along the\r\n  sides of the body from the anterior to the posterior end, while two\r\n  other bands, the median lines, running along the ventral and dorsal\r\n  mid-lines, are less evident; in exceptional cases there are also four\r\n  sub-median lines. These bands or lines are inward projections of the\r\n  ectoderm, and in them lie the nerves and excretory vessels (fig. 260).\r\n\r\n  Some Nematodes live free in fresh or salt water, in soil, mud or\r\n  decaying vegetable matter, others parasitically in the most various\r\n  organs of animals, frequently also in plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nANATOMY OF THE NEMATODES.\r\n\r\nAll the Nematodes are covered by (1) a CUTICLE, which in the small\r\nspecies is thin and delicate, while in the larger species it is\r\nthickened, and may consist of several layers of complicated structure.\r\nCanalicular pores do not occur. According to general opinion, which\r\nis confirmed by the history of development, the cuticle is a product\r\nof (2) the EPITHELIUM or ectoderm that had formerly existed or is\r\nstill found beneath it; in young specimens and small species it is\r\nperceptible, but in older worms it frequently alters so considerably\r\nthat not only do the borders of the cells disappear,[297] but a fine\r\nfibrous differentiation appears in their cytoplasm. The matrix or\r\nectoderm then has the appearance of an ectodermal syncytium permeated\r\nby fibres and strewn with nuclei, so that it is hardly distinguishable\r\nfrom the tissue of (3) the CUTIS, which is always present, though\r\ndeveloped to a varying degree. Both layers, matrix and cutis, project\r\ninternally as ridges and form the lateral lines, while the less marked\r\nmedian lines are produced apparently only by the ectoderm (fig. 260).\r\n\r\n[297] In the _Ascaridæ_ isolated epidermal cells grow to a considerable\r\nsize, and have to do with the sensory apparatus of the lips\r\n(Goldschmidt).\r\n\r\nUnicellular cutaneous glands are known in parasitic as well as in\r\nfree-living species; they vary in number and arrangement, and are found\r\ndischarging some at the anterior extremity and others in the vicinity\r\nof the genital orifices. In other cases large numbers of them are\r\npresent along the lateral lines; they are strongly developed in most\r\nof the _Trichotrachelidæ_, where they discharge either along a part of\r\nthe ventral surface or along the lateral and median lines; they are\r\nplaced so closely together that the ridges of the cuticle perforated by\r\nthe orifices have long been known, and have been described, as “rodlet\r\nborders,” or “fields of rods.”\r\n\r\nAs the cutis is immediately adjacent to (4) the DERMO-MUSCULAR TUBE\r\nthe simple layer of the muscular cells is divided into four quadrants\r\nby the longitudinal lines--two dorsal and two ventral (fig. 260). The\r\nMUSCLES are in the simplest cases large rhomboid cells that lie two\r\nby two in each quadrant, so that on transverse section of the entire\r\nworm only eight cells are perceptible. The outer border of the cells is\r\nconverted into contractile fibrils, while the contiguous inner portion\r\nhas remained protoplasmic, and contains the nucleus. In large species\r\nthe muscular cells do not only increase in length (up to 3 mm.) and in\r\nnumber in every quadrant, but their contractile portion curves up to\r\nform a groove (like that of a dead leaf) thereby even becoming thicker;\r\nsimultaneously space is gained for more cells, the protoplasmic parts\r\nof these cells (on transverse section) project out of the grooves\r\nlike vesicles. In all cases there is only one layer of longitudinal\r\nmuscular cells, which, by contracting, can shorten the body or, by\r\ncontracting one side, can bend it. In the latter case the muscles of\r\nthe opposite side have an antagonistic effect, or when all the muscles\r\nare contracted, the elasticity of the cuticle acts in the same way.\r\nSpecial muscles exist at the beginning of the gut and at sections of\r\nthe genital apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe existence of a cavity between the body and the gut wall has\r\nhitherto been generally assumed, and has been referred to the cleavage\r\ncavity, and consequently designated as a primary body cavity. More\r\nrecent investigators, however, state that such a cavity does not\r\nexist, but that the space between the longitudinal muscles or their\r\nprotoplasmic portions and the gut epithelium is filled by a complicated\r\n“isolation tissue.” This in the main proceeds from a large cell\r\n(_Is._, fig. 262) which lies directly behind the nerve ring dorsal to\r\nthe œsophagus, and consists of a system of lamellæ which sheathe the\r\nmuscles and penetrate through them to the cutis and also cover the gut\r\nin a thin layer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 260.--Diagram of a transverse section of _Ascaris\r\nlumbricoides_, showing thick cuticle, and beneath it the matrix or\r\nsyncytial ectoderm. The flat intestine is in the middle, and to\r\nthe right and left near it in the body wall the lateral lines with\r\nexcretory vessel and lateral nerves; above and below in the centre\r\nthe dorsal or ventral median lines with the nerves radiating to the\r\nmuscles, also the muscle cells with their striated outer contractile\r\nportion and inner nucleated vesicular protoplasmic portion. About 50/1.\r\n(After Brandes.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 261.--Anterior end of an _Ascaris megalocephala_\r\ncut open and showing the four tuft-like organs lying on the lateral\r\nlines. Natural size. (After Nassonow.)]\r\n\r\nWe may now consider the “tuft-like” or “phagocytic” organs, which\r\nattain 1 cm. in size, and consist of four, six, or even more ramified\r\ncells, which lie close to the walls of the body (fig. 261). They\r\nare found either only in the anterior part of the body (Ascaris),\r\nor throughout the whole length of the body (Strongylus, syn.,\r\nSclerostomum), and their position usually corresponds to the lateral\r\nlines. In some species there are small protoplasmic cells on the\r\nprocesses of these organs. In consequence of their size they can be\r\nrecognized with the naked eye, especially when they are loaded with\r\ngranules of stain (carmine, Indian ink) injected into the body cavity.\r\n\r\nINTESTINAL CANAL.--The oral aperture, which is situated at the tip\r\nof the anterior extremity, is frequently surrounded by thick lips,\r\nor small bristles, or papillæ; it leads to a more or less strongly\r\ndeveloped buccal cavity, which is lined by a continuation of the\r\nbody cuticle, and which in some species is provided with “teeth,”\r\nrepresenting differentiated portions of the cuticle.\r\n\r\nTHE ŒSOPHAGUS (fig. 262), which arises from the base of the oral\r\ncavity, is as a rule a short, bottle-shaped tube with triradiate\r\nlumen; its wall is chiefly composed of radiating muscular fibres,\r\nwhich give it the appearance of being transversely striped when viewed\r\nfrom the surface. There exist also in its wall three large gland cells\r\n(œsophageal glands) and nerves arising from the lateral lines and\r\nrunning forward. The radial fibres cause a dilatation of the lumen,\r\nand exercise an effect antagonistic to the elasticity of the cuticle\r\nlining the inner surface. The latter has its own particular layer,\r\nwhich is not in direct connection with that of the oral cavity. Special\r\ndilator muscles, arising from the dermo-muscular tube and situated at\r\nthe commencement of the œsophagus, are only known in a few species.\r\nThe posterior end of the œsophagus presents a bulb-like dilatation,\r\nand is frequently provided with small chitinous movable valves. In a\r\nfew forms, which belong to the _Trichotrachelidæ_ (Trichocephalus,\r\nTrichinella), the œsophagus is a very long cuticular tube, beset on\r\nits dorsal surface with a series of large nucleated cells. In others\r\n(Cucullanus, Ascaris, etc.), a tube, the so-called glandular stomach,\r\nlined only by epithelial cells, follows behind the muscular œsophagus.\r\nThis glandular stomach is, from its structure, easily distinguished\r\nfrom the mid-gut, or chyle intestine, which is likewise cellular. The\r\nso-called mid-gut is a tube lined by flat, cubical, or cylindrical\r\ncells (fig. 260) surrounded by “isolation tissue”; its transverse\r\nsection is circular or flattened dorso-ventrally; the lumen may run in\r\na straight line, or it runs a sinuous course through the alternating\r\nprominences of the then flat epithelial cells.\r\n\r\nThe ectodermal hind gut is, as a rule, very short. At the anal opening\r\nthe cuticle and the subcuticular layers are reflected inwards, forming\r\nthe lining of the hind gut. In large species the subcuticular tissue\r\nforms large cells on which anteriorly lie in addition large “glandular\r\ncells.”[298] In the male the ejaculatory duct opens at this point.\r\nAround the end part of the gut, either on the chyle intestine or at the\r\nbeginning of the end gut, there exists a sphincter muscle arising from\r\na muscle cell which acts antagonistically to the two diaphragm-like\r\ndilator muscle cells which stretch from the gut to the body wall.\r\nIn many species large stretches of the gut are provided with dilator\r\nmuscles. There is sometimes a retrogressive absorption of the gut in\r\nthe adult stage of a few parasitic species.\r\n\r\n[298] In Ankylostomes according to Looss these cells have no glandular\r\nfunction, but are ligaments.\r\n\r\nINTESTINAL CÆCA and ŒSOPHAGEAL GLANDS sometimes exist as intestinal\r\nappendages; the former are tubular appendages of various size, running\r\nbackwards or forwards, and arising from the posterior extremity of the\r\nœsophagus. They are lacking in many species. The œsophageal glands are\r\nunicellular; a dorsal and two subventral glands may be distinguished\r\naccording to their position; as a rule they open into the œsophagus at\r\na distance from one another. The body of the gland lies in the bulb of\r\nthe œsophagus, or in the dorsal _cul-de-sac_ arising from it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 262.--Transverse section through _Ascaris\r\nlumbricoides_ at the level of the œsophagus behind the nerve ring.\r\n_Cu._, cuticle; _Sc._, subcuticular layer; _Ex._, excretory vessel;\r\n_Is._, isolation cell and the system of lamellæ proceeding from it;\r\n_M._, muscles; _Ml._, median line; _Sl._, lateral line. Magnified.\r\n(After Goldschmidt.)]\r\n\r\nTHE NERVOUS SYSTEM is sufficiently known in a few species only; it\r\nconsists of a ring containing fifty to sixty fibres closely surrounding\r\nthe œsophagus, various groups of ganglion cells, and a certain number\r\nof nerves extending anteriorly as well as posteriorly. The remarkably\r\nsmall number of fibres, as well as ganglion cells, is characteristic\r\nof the nervous system of all Nematodes. Immediately behind the\r\nœsophageal ring (fig. 263, _Lg._) an agglomeration of ganglion cells\r\nlies at either side (lateral ganglia); part of their off-shoots form\r\nthe œsophageal ring, and part are directed posteriorly and ventrally,\r\nand unite partly in front of and partly at the back of the excretory\r\npore, with fibres originating direct from the œsophageal ring, and\r\npassing along the ventral median line to the back; these fibres then\r\ntogether form the ventral median nerve (fig. 263, _V.m.n._). This\r\nnerve, originally consisting of thirty to fifty fibres, becomes in\r\nthe female attenuated quite evenly in its further course. There is\r\nalso an agglomeration of ganglion cells close in front of the anus\r\n(anal ganglia), and then the median nerve divides in order to combine\r\nwith the lateral nerves on either side. In the male the median nerve\r\nenlarges to nearly the original number of fibres in front of the anal\r\nganglion, which contains seven cells; there is also an anal ring\r\nembracing the terminal gut, and there are two ganglion cells in it on\r\neach side. In the dorsal median line the dorsal median nerve is alike\r\nin both sexes; arising in front with a single root from the œsophageal\r\nring, it gathers its fibres from the lateral ganglia; in the anterior\r\npart of the body it consists of thirteen to twenty fibres; in the\r\nposterior part of the body the fibres are reduced to four or six;\r\nbehind the anus it divides and combines with the lateral nerves; the\r\nlatter consists of two fascicles at either side right up to their most\r\nposterior extent--one dorsal and one ventral--which in the greater part\r\nof the body do not run in, but beside the lateral lines, and exhibit a\r\ndifferent origin anteriorly. The ventral fascicle at each side branches\r\noff from the ventral median nerve in front of the excretory pore,\r\nwhereas the dorsal fascicles originate from the œsophageal ring close\r\nto the lateral ganglia. Each of the four fascicles contains only two\r\nor three fibres, which run backwards parallel to the lateral lines; a\r\nfew centimetres in front of the caudal extremity they enter the lateral\r\nlines and remain separate from one another up to the level of the anal\r\nganglion; here they amalgamate on either side, after each interpolating\r\none ganglion cell, with the single short lateral nerve which first\r\ntakes up the forked ends of the ventral and then of the dorsal median\r\nnerve; finally, both lateral nerves unite with each other at the back\r\nin an arch-like manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 263.--Schematic representation of the nervous\r\nsystem of a male _Ascaris megalocephala_. _A._, anus; _Ag._, anal\r\nganglion; _C._, commissures; _D.m.n._, dorsal median nerve; _Exp._,\r\nexcretory pore; _Pr._, œsophageal sensory ring; _Lg._, lateral ganglia;\r\n_Ln._, lateral nerve; _Sp._, papilla; _V.m.n._, ventral median nerve.\r\n(After Brandes.)]\r\n\r\nIn the male each ventral part of the lateral nerves becomes thickened\r\nby taking up fibres from the ventral nerves, which become thickened\r\nposteriorly to the nervus bursalis, which towards the middle gives off\r\na mass of fibres to the “genital papillæ” situated in front of and\r\nbehind the anus; the number of these fibres averages eighty to 100; in\r\nits further course the bursal nerve resembles the corresponding ventral\r\npart of the lateral nerves of the female.\r\n\r\nThe ventral and dorsal nerves are connected by a number of semicircular\r\ncommissures, which originate from the ventral nerves and serve to\r\nsupply the dorsal nerve, which is always being decreased by fibres\r\ndeparting from it. It is remarkable that these commissures are not\r\nplaced symmetrically, and their position also is different in the\r\ntwo sexes; in the female there are thirty-one on the right side and\r\nonly thirteen on the left side. In the male there are thirty-three\r\ncommissures on the right side and fourteen on the left, which run into\r\nthe subcuticular layer, generally in pairs, and usually cross at the\r\nlevel of the lateral lines.\r\n\r\nThe fibres of the two median nerves are chiefly motor; fascicular\r\nprocesses run from each protoplasmic part of the muscular cells to\r\nthe median nerves; from these they take up bundles of primitive\r\nfibrils, which separate, pass through the protoplasmic part and enter\r\nthe contractile part (fig. 260). One part of the fibrils, however,\r\npenetrates beyond the muscles into the subcuticular layer, where they\r\nform a network, probably of a sensory nature, with contiguous fibrils.\r\nNerves directed anteriorly finally originate from the œsophageal ring;\r\nthey consist each of three fibres, carry three ganglion cells at their\r\npoint of origin, and enter the sensory organs of the three papillæ\r\nsurrounding the oral aperture. Two of these little trunks lie in the\r\nlateral lines, the remaining four are situated in the middle of the\r\nfour quadrants (Nn. sub-mediani anteriores).\r\n\r\nParasitic species lack higher ORGANS OF SENSE; free-living worms\r\noccasionally have two rust-red eyes, sometimes with lenses, at the\r\nanterior part of the body. In addition to the above-mentioned sensory\r\npapillæ surrounding the oral aperture and the genital papillæ of the\r\nmale at the end of the body, another pair exist in the vicinity of the\r\nlateral ganglia, the “cervical papillæ,” and two dorsal papillæ in the\r\ncentral region of the body and two lateral ones near the tip of the\r\ntail (_Ascaridæ_). The differences in the distribution and number of\r\nthe sensory papillæ serve for characterizing the larger and smaller\r\ngroups of Nematodes.\r\n\r\nTHE EXCRETORY ORGANS of the Nematodes are variable. In a great many\r\ncases the apparatus is symmetrical, and consists of a vessel commencing\r\nin the posterior extremity in each lateral line (fig. 260), and passing\r\nanteriorly. In the vicinity of the anterior extremity both tubes pass\r\nout of the lateral lines, bend ventrally, and, in the median ventral\r\nline, unite into a short vesicle formed by an ectodermal cell--the\r\ncavity of which is lined by a continuation of the cuticle of the\r\nbody--which opens into the excretory pore (fig. 263, _Exp._). Asymmetry\r\nis occasioned through the excretory duct proceeding from the ventral\r\npore to the lateral line, and it here proceeds as (or takes up) the\r\nleft excretory canal, which anteriorly is a broader tube and runs along\r\nthe left lateral line; shortly before its union with the excretory duct\r\nit throws out a branch to the right towards the lateral line, which,\r\nhowever, always remains weak, and runs posteriorly in the right lateral\r\nline; a few smaller branches in addition spring from the left main\r\nstem. In other species the right branch is completely suppressed; the\r\nentire organ thus lies in the left lateral line, and consists of the\r\nexcretory duct, which occasionally opens quite in front near the lips,\r\nas well as the excretory canal, which throws out a number of lateral\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\nThis excretory vesicle is a single elongated or horse-shoe-shaped\r\ncell, with a large nucleus and an intracellular tubular system, which\r\nis connected with the excretory duct arising from the excretory pore\r\non the outer surface (fig. 326). The so-called ventral gland is the\r\nonly excretory organ of marine Nematodes, and probably represents\r\na primitive form. Goldschmidt, who has investigated the excretory\r\napparatus of _Ascaris lumbricoides_, considers that the vessels running\r\nin the lateral lines are only ducts to which belong a glandular system\r\nhitherto overlooked or otherwise interpreted. This system also lies in\r\nthe lateral lines, and takes the form of two glandular tracts, forming\r\na syncytial tissue in which lie the ducts, one dorsal, one ventral.\r\nIn parts these tracts are connected by commissures, although their\r\njunction with the excretory vessels cannot be clearly made out. These\r\nstatements, however, require confirmation. The author has further found\r\nthat the anterior ends of the lateral canals, directly before they bend\r\nventrally, anastomose with one another and give off anteriorly a small\r\nblind process, which can be interpreted as a rudiment of a canal coming\r\nfrom the head end, and as a matter of fact, according to Golowin, such\r\nanterior excretory canals exist in a number of genera.\r\n\r\nIn a number of Nematodes (Cheiracanthus, Capillaria, Trichocephalus,\r\nTrichinella, etc.), however, special excretory organs are lacking;\r\npossibly the cutaneous glands, which are in these species generally\r\npowerfully developed, replace these organs.\r\n\r\nSEXUAL ORGANS.--With the exception of a few species, the Nematodes are\r\nsexually differentiated.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Female Sexual Organs._--The sexual orifice (vulva), surrounded\r\nby thick labia, is, as a rule, ventral and varies in position from\r\nnear the head to near the anus. It leads into a short or long vagina\r\n(ectodermic), bifurcating into the two uteri, which may be long or\r\nshort; the long filiform ovaries are continuations of them (fig. 264).\r\nFurther there is often, _e.g._, in Ankylostoma, a differentiation into\r\nthe following parts: (1) _Ovejector_: the specialized portion of the\r\nuterus before it joins the vagina; there may be a separate one for\r\neach uterus, or a common one for both uteri. (2) _Seminal receptacle_:\r\nat the other extremity of the uterus. (3) _Oviduct_: a narrow tube\r\nconnecting the ovary with the uterus proper. (For the explanation of\r\nthe terms _convergent_ and _divergent_ uteri _vide_ footnote p. 432.)\r\nUterus and ovaries, which arise in the first place from a single cell,\r\nlie between the body wall and the gut and are surrounded by connective\r\ntissue. In some species (for instance, Trichinella) the ovary is single.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 264.--Diagram of female genitalia. _Ov._, ovary (in\r\npart); _Ovd._, oviduct; _Rec. sem._, seminal receptacle; _Ut._, uterus\r\n(in part); _Ovj._, ovejector; _Vag._, vagina.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 264A.--Diagram of male genitalia of a strongylid.\r\n_Test._, testis (in part); _S.V._, seminal vesicle; _c.g._, cement\r\ngland surrounding ejaculatory duct; _sp._, spicules; _cl._, cloaca;\r\n_gub._, gubernaculum; _p.p.a._, pulvillus post-analis; _g.c._, genital\r\ncone; _l.d._, dorsal lateral line; _l.v._, ventral lateral line (the\r\nbursa is not shown).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 265.--Transverse section through the ovarian tube\r\nof _Belascaris cati_ of the cat at various levels. To demonstrate the\r\ndevelopment (right to left) of the ova and of the rhachis. Magnified.]\r\n\r\n  At the blind end of the ovary there is a mass of protoplasm with\r\n  numerous nuclei that multiply continuously. Gradually the nuclei\r\n  arrange themselves in longitudinal rows (fig. 265) and the protoplasm\r\n  commences to leave the periphery and surround each nucleus. The\r\n  nearer to the uterus the more progressive is this loosening process,\r\n  until club-shaped cells each containing a nucleus are developed. The\r\n  most pointed end of each, however, is still attached to an axial\r\n  fibre of protoplasm, the _rhachis_; probably this has some connection\r\n  with the nutrition of the ova. Finally the ova fall off and reach the\r\n  uterus, where they are fertilized and enclosed in shells.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Male Sexual Organs._--There is never more than one testis\r\n(fig. 266), which is a straight or sinuous tube of the same\r\nconstruction as an ovary, and in which the mother cells originate\r\nin the same manner as the ova. In the same way as the ovary passes\r\ninto the uterus, so does the testis pass into the spermatic duct; the\r\nlatter is often divided into the somewhat dilated seminal vesicle\r\nand into the muscular ductus ejaculatorius, which, running ventral\r\nto the intestine backward (fig. 267), finally opens into the cloaca.\r\nIn many species, _e.g._, _A. duodenale_, the ejaculatory duct is\r\nsurrounded for a greater or less portion of its extent by the cement\r\ngland, the secretion of which (brownish or blackish in colour) serves\r\nfor copulation. The ejaculatory duct of the large _Ascaridæ_ is for\r\nthe most of its course surrounded by a muscular network which takes\r\nits origin from the two dilator cells of the gut (fig. 268 _F_.).\r\nThe spermatozoa of the Nematodes, it may be noted, only attain their\r\nfull development after the sperm mother cells have been conveyed by\r\ncopulation into the uteri of the female genitalia. In their form\r\n(sheathless, capable of amœboid motion) they differ from those of most\r\nother animals.\r\n\r\nSPICULES.--The male genital apparatus is also provided with one or\r\ntwo sacs, situated on the dorsal side of the intestine, and opening\r\ninto the cloaca. In each sac there is a chitinous rod-like body, the\r\nspicule. Further, in many cases there exists, more or less fixed in the\r\ndorsal wall of the cloaca, a chitinous structure, the accessory piece\r\nor _gubernaculum_, the latter name implying its function of guiding the\r\nspicules during copulation (fig. 264A). A special muscular apparatus,\r\nconsisting of protractors and retractors, moves the spicules. The\r\nprotractors or exsertors in the large Ascaridæ consist of four flat\r\nband-like muscles which surround the spicule sac. Two long muscle\r\ncells which arise proportionally far forward on the dorsal side of\r\nthe lateral line and are inserted into the base of the spicules serve\r\nas retractors. The spicules can be projected from the cloacal orifice\r\n(anus) during copulation, and when they are introduced into the vagina\r\nthey serve as prehensile organs, perhaps also as stimulatory organs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 266.--Male of the rhabditic form of _Angiostomum\r\nnigrovenosum_. _A._, anus; _I._, mid-gut; _T._, testicular tube; _O._,\r\noral orifice; _P._, papillæ; _Sp._, spicule.

The muscular fibres are between the lateral and median\r\nlines. Magnified.]\r\n\r\nBURSA COPULATRIX.--The males in many genera possess epidermal wing-like\r\nappendages at their posterior extremity. These are supported by\r\nelongated tactile papillæ called ribs. In the most highly developed\r\nbursæ, _e.g._, in the _Strongylidæ_, the ribs are called rays, as\r\nthey consist not only of nerve fibres but mainly of “pulp,” _i.e._,\r\nprolongations of the subcuticular layer. Bursæ are either open,\r\n_i.e._, bilaterally symmetrical, or closed, when the posterior border\r\nis continuous all round. A _pseudo-bursa_ is one unsupported by\r\nribs or rays, _e.g._, in Trichuris. The bursa serves as an organ of\r\nprehension during copulation. Some forms, moreover, carry a sucker at\r\nthe posterior extremity (_e.g._, Heterakis); in others the spicules\r\nand other prehensile organs are absent; they are then replaced by an\r\nevertible cloaca, _e.g._, Trichinella.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF THE NEMATODES.\r\n\r\nAfter impregnation, the ovum develops around itself a delicate membrane\r\n(vitelline membrane), and subsequently an egg-shell is formed. This\r\nis derived either as a secretion from the uterine wall or it is a\r\nfurther differentiation of the vitelline membrane, the original single\r\nmembrane splitting into two, the outer becoming the egg-shell. Further\r\nthe uterus often secretes a special albuminous covering around the\r\negg-shell. The “yolk” granules of the ovum are secretions of the\r\nprotoplasm of the ovum itself and first appear when the rhachis is\r\nformed. In certain cases ova lie in follicles or capsules formed\r\nof epithelium cells derived from the ovarian tubes. These cells\r\nsubsequently fuse and form a membrane--the CHORION.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 268.--Hind end of a male _Ascaris lumbricoides_ cut\r\nacross at the level of the dilator cells of the gut. _D._, gut; _Dil._,\r\ndilator cells of the gut; _F._, a process of the dilator cells forming\r\na network over the vas deferens; _Sl._, lateral line; _Sp._, spicule;\r\n_Vd._, vas deferens. The anterior end of the worm lies to the right.\r\nMagnified. (After Goldschmidt.)]\r\n\r\nThe shape of the completed eggs is characteristic of the different\r\nspecies, and therefore a single egg often suffices to diagnose the\r\nspecies. According to the species, the eggs may be deposited sooner\r\nor later, either before or during segmentation, or with the embryo\r\nperfectly developed. Only a few species are viviparous, _e.g._,\r\n_Dracunculus mediensis_, _Trichinella spiralis_; in the other Nematodes\r\nthe further development of the extruded eggs takes place after various\r\nlengths of time in the open, in moist earth, or in water. Thick-shelled\r\neggs can maintain their developmental capacity for a long time, even\r\nafter prolonged desiccation.\r\n\r\nFinally, a nematode-like embryo develops, which usually lies somewhat\r\ncoiled up within the shell, and varies in its further development\r\naccording to the species to which it belongs.\r\n\r\nIn the simplest forms, as in the free-living Nematodes, the embryos,\r\napart from their size, resemble their parents, and grow up into these\r\nafter leaving the egg-shell. In many parasitical Nematodes, however,\r\nthe young must be called _larvæ_, as they present characters which are\r\nsubsequently lost.\r\n\r\nThe manner of conveyance of the eggs or the embryos contained in them\r\nafter they have left the body into the definite host is very different\r\nin the various species.\r\n\r\n(1) _Without Intermediate Host._--(_a_) In many the conveyance into\r\nthe definite host is effected directly after the larvæ have developed\r\nwithin the eggs; thus, for instance, the feeding of suitable animals\r\nwith the embryo-containing eggs of species of Trichocephalus and\r\nAscaris leads to an infection of the gut, for the young Trichocephali\r\nor Ascarides only leave the egg-shell when they have attained the\r\nintestine of the final host, in which they become adult.\r\n\r\nIn other cases (_b_) Ancylostoma, Necator, the larvæ hatch in the open,\r\nand live for a time free, changing their form; they grow, cast their\r\nskin, and finally gain the intestine of the host by means of water or\r\nthrough the skin, when they lose their larval characters and assume the\r\nstructure of the adult worm.\r\n\r\n(_c_) In a number of Nematodes, however, HETEROGONY occurs. This terms\r\nsignifies a mode of development in which two structurally different\r\nsexual generations of the same species alternate with each other. To\r\nthese appertains, for instance, _Angiostomum_ (syn.: _Rhabdonema_)\r\n_nigrovenosum_, which lives in the lungs of frogs and toads; this\r\nNematode measures about 1 cm. in length and is hermaphrodite\r\n(protandric). The eggs are deposited in the pulmonary cavity, and\r\nthrough the cilia of the same reach the oral cavity, where they are\r\nswallowed and thus conveyed into the intestine. They pass through the\r\nentire gut, and are finally evacuated with the fæces; often, indeed,\r\nthe young themselves emerge from the egg-shell within the hind-gut\r\nof the frogs. These young forms become sexually differentiated,\r\nremain much smaller than the parent, their œsophagus is differently\r\nconstructed (rhabditis form), and they are non-parasitic (fig. 266).\r\nAfter having grown in the open they copulate; the males die soon after\r\ncopulation, and the females in their own bodies develop a few young,\r\nwhich, given the opportunity to get into frogs, infect them, and are\r\ntransformed into the hermaphroditic Angiostomum. The same manner of\r\ndevelopment occurs in other species of the same genus, and also in the\r\ncase of _Strongyloides stercoralis_.\r\n\r\n(2) _With Intermediate Host._--(_a_) Frequently, however, the larvæ\r\nof Nematodes make use of one or even two intermediate hosts; their\r\ncondition then resembles that of Cestodes or Trematodes, excepting that\r\nthere is never a multiplication within the intermediate hosts. The\r\nlarvæ become encapsuled amongst the tissues of the intermediate host,\r\nand wait till they are introduced with the latter into the final host.\r\nFor instance, _Ollulanus tricuspis_, the adult form of which is found\r\nin cats, previously lives encysted in the muscular system of mice.\r\n_Cucullanus elegans_, which attains the adult stage in fishes (perch,\r\netc.), is found encysted in species of Cyclops. Other examples of\r\nspecies that require an intermediate host are _Filaria bancrofti_ and\r\n_Dracunculus medinensis_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 269.--A piece of the trunk muscle of the pig with\r\nencapsuled embryonic Trichinæ. Magnified.]\r\n\r\nPeculiar conditions prevail in the case of (_b_) _Trichinella\r\nspiralis_. This species, which in its adult state lives in the\r\nintestine of man and of various mammals, is viviparous; the young\r\nTrichinæ, however, do not leave the intestine, but reach the intestinal\r\nwall (Cerfontaine, Askanazy) in the following way: the female\r\nintestinal Trichinæ bore into the intestinal wall, where they are found\r\nin the submucosa, or in the lumen of the dilated lacteal vessels. Here\r\nthe young are born, in the intestinal wall, and leave this position\r\nwith the lymph stream. Some of them, no doubt, actively bore through\r\nthe intestinal wall, reaching the lymph or blood-stream, or even pass\r\ninto the body cavity. What occurs during their further migrations is\r\ndifficult to say at present. It has hitherto been maintained that\r\nthe wandering is entirely active; for instance, the ligaturing of an\r\nartery would be no protection against the part of the body supplied\r\nby such artery being invaded by Trichinella. This observation cannot\r\nbe otherwise explained than by the active progress of the young\r\nTrichinella. The question, however, may be mooted as to where and when\r\nthe worms quit the blood-vessels, which they for the most part reach\r\nthrough the thoracic duct, the natural connection between the vascular\r\nsystem and the lymphatic system, to wander further independently, and\r\nultimately reach the muscular system, in which they become encysted\r\n(fig. 269). Thus the progeny does not leave the body of the host\r\ninhabited by the parents, as is generally the case amongst helminthes,\r\nbut uses it as an intermediate carrier to reach another host, which is\r\nthen the final host. The latter may belong to another species, or may\r\nbe another individual of the same species. This second migration is, of\r\ncourse, purely passive.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF THE NEMATODA.\r\n\r\n  The Nematodes are usually divided into a number of families, some of\r\n  which it is at present impossible to define accurately; moreover, the\r\n  definition of many genera is also in an unsatisfactory state.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Anguillulidæ*, Gervais and van Beneden, 1859.\r\n\r\n  A “family” name not definable. They comprise a vast number of\r\n  small forms, most of which live free in fresh water, in soil, or\r\n  in macerating substances; amongst them there are some which live\r\n  parasitically on plants, more rarely on animals. They do not exceed\r\n  8 mm. in length. The large majority are only 1 to 2 mm., or even\r\n  0·5 mm. The uterus is straight. Eggs in the uterus at one time,\r\n  one to four. Genera very numerous, but many of them insufficiently\r\n  defined (Anguillula, Anguillulina, Rhabditis, Heterodera, etc.).\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Angiostomidæ*, Braun, 1895.\r\n\r\n  Small Nematodes undefined morphologically, but characterized by\r\n  heterogony, _i.e._, there is a free-living “rhabditic” generation\r\n  and a parasitic “filariform” generation which succeed one another\r\n  (_e.g._, Angiostomum, Strongyloides, Probstmayria).\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Gnathostomidæ.*\r\n\r\n  Cuticle covered totally or partly with cuticular laminæ fringed\r\n  posteriorly with multiple points. Head subglobular, covered with\r\n  simple spines. Two spicules. Vulva behind middle of body, parasitic\r\n  in vertebrates, especially mammals (_e.g._, Gnathostoma, Tanqua,\r\n  Rictularia).\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Dracunculidæ*, Leiper, 1912.\r\n\r\n  Males very small in proportion to females. Anus absent. Vulva absent\r\n  (?). Genera: Dracunculus, Icthyonema (in body cavity of eel and other\r\n  fish).\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Filariidæ*, Claus, 1885.\r\n\r\n  Long thread-like Nematodes. Anus present. Œsophagus without bulb.\r\n  Vulva usually in anterior half of body. Two ovaries. Generally\r\n  ovoviviparous. Development often requires an intermediate host. This\r\n  family is at present ill-defined, but has been already subdivided\r\n  into several sub-families, _Filariinæ_, _Onchocercinæ_, _Arduenninæ_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Trichinellidæ*, Stiles and Crane, 1910.\r\n\r\n  Œsophagus consisting of a chain of single cells, the lumen of the\r\n  œsophagus passing through their centre. Ovary single. Vulva at\r\n  junction of anterior and posterior portions. Sub-families: (1)\r\n  _Trichurinæ_, (2) _Trichinellinæ_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Dioctophymidæ.*\r\n\r\n  Body anteriorly armed with spines or unarmed; mouth without lips,\r\n  with six, twelve, or eighteen papillæ in one or two circles;\r\n  œsophagus very long without a bulb; anus terminal in female; one\r\n  ovary; vagina very long; spicule in male very long; bursa cup-shaped\r\n  without rays (Dioctophyme, Hystrichis, Eustrongylides).\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Strongylidæ*, Cobbold, 1864.\r\n\r\n  Bursa, supported by rays, always present. Oviparous.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Physalopteridæ.*\r\n\r\n  Mouth with two large lips. Bursa with supporting papillæ in form of a\r\n  lanceolate cuticular expansion, with genus Physaloptera.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Ascaridæ*, Cobbold, 1864.\r\n\r\n  Rather thick Nematodes. Mouth with three lips--one dorsal, two\r\n  latero-ventral. Sub-families: (1) _Ascarinæ_, (2) _Heterakinæ_, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Oxyuridæ.*\r\n\r\n  Smallish forms, 4 to 45 mm., with cuticle thickened on each side\r\n  for the whole length of body in the form of a lateral flange or\r\n  wing. Œsophagus long with a well-marked bulb containing a valvular\r\n  apparatus. Tail end of female drawn out into a long point. Eggs\r\n  asymmetrical. Males very small (about 2 mm.). One spicule. Genera:\r\n  Oxyuris, Passalurus, Ozolaimus, Atractis, etc.\r\n\r\n  _Mermithidæ_, greatly elongated “Nematodes,” which, in the larval\r\n  stage, are parasitic in insects, but in their adult condition are\r\n  free living. Cuticle with diagonal striation. Without an open\r\n  mouth or anus. Oral papillæ present. Characteristic eggs with two\r\n  processes, ending in a tuft of filaments. Larvæ with a movable boring\r\n  spine at the head end.\r\n\r\n  _Gordiidæ._--Long, thread-like “Nematodes.” Mouth and anterior\r\n  portion of gut atrophied in adult. Oral papillæ absent.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEMATODES OBSERVED IN MAN.\r\n\r\n      Family       Sub-family            Genus                Species\r\n  _Anguillulidæ_      --              _Rhabditis_         _R. pellio._\r\n                                                          _R. niellyi._\r\n                                                          _Rhabditis sp._\r\n                                      _Anguillula_        _A. aceti._\r\n                                      _Anguillulina_      _A. putrefaciens._\r\n  _Angiostomidæ_      --              _Strongyloides_     _St. stercoralis._\r\n  _Gnathostomidæ_     --              _Gnathostoma_       _Gn. siamense._\r\n                                                          _Gn. spinigerum._\r\n  _Dracunculidæ_      --              _Dracunculus_       _D. medinensis._\r\n  _Filariidæ_     _Filariinæ_         _Filaria_           _F. bancrofti._\r\n                                                          _F. demarquayi._\r\n                                                          _F. taniguchi._\r\n                                                          _F.

Its chitinous wall uniformly\r\n  thick. Lateral lines absent. Males with bursa.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Rhabditis pellio*, Schneider, 1866.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Pelodera pellio_, Schn., 1866; _Rhabditis genitalis_,\r\n  Scheiber, 1880; _Rhabditis pellio_, Schn., 1866.\r\n\r\nMales 0·8 to 1·05 mm. in length; females, 0·9 to 1·3 mm. in length. The\r\nposterior extremity of the body of the male has a heart-shaped bursa,\r\nand seven to ten ribs on each side; the bursa may, however, be lacking.\r\nThe spicules measure 0·027 to 0·033 mm. in length, but are never quite\r\nalike. The posterior extremity of the female is long and pointed; the\r\nvulva lies somewhat behind the middle of the body, the ovary is single,\r\nthe eggs are oval, 60 µ by 35 µ.\r\n\r\n  This species was found in Stuhlweissenburg by Scheiber in the acid\r\n  urine (containing albumin, pus and blood) of a woman suffering from\r\n  pyelonephritis, pneumonia and acute intestinal catarrh; the observer\r\n  was able to convince himself that the Nematodes which were found\r\n  during the whole period of the illness lived in the vagina, and were\r\n  evacuated with the urine.\r\n\r\nOerley proved that this species had long been known; during its larval\r\nstage (_Anguillula mucronata_, Grube, 1849) it lives in earthworms;\r\nin its adult stage it lives in decomposing matter in the soil. By\r\nintroducing individuals of this species into the vagina of mice, Oerley\r\nsucceeded in obtaining infection and multiplication (facultative\r\nparasitism). These Nematodes must in some such way have got into the\r\nvagina of Scheiber’s patient.\r\n\r\nTwo other cases described by Baginsky and Peiper probably belonged to\r\nthe same or a nearly related species.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Rhabditis niellyi*, Blanchard, 1885.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Leptodera niellyi_, Blanchard, 1885.\r\n\r\nIn 1882 Nielly had a cabin-boy, aged 14, under observation in\r\nBrest. The lad had never left the neighbourhood of Brest, and had\r\nsuffered from itching papules on the skin for five or six weeks; in\r\nthe papules the observer found one or several rhabdites, measuring\r\n0·33 mm. in length by 0·30 mm. in breadth. Their cuticle presented a\r\ndelicate transverse striation; the intestine was the only internal\r\norgan recognizable, and it opened somewhat in front of the posterior\r\nextremity. Therefore, it must have belonged to the rhabditis-like larva\r\nof a Nematode, the adult stage of which is unknown.\r\n\r\n  The manner of infection was established almost certainly by a further\r\n  observation of Nielly’s: at the commencement of the illness small\r\n  Nematodes were found in the blood of the patient; later on, however,\r\n  they disappeared, neither were Nematodes found in the fæces, urine\r\n  or sputum. Therefore it must be concluded that the cabin-boy, who\r\n  was in the habit of drinking water from brooks, had thus ingested\r\n  embryo-containing eggs of a Nematode; the young hatched out in the\r\n  intestine, perforated it, reached the blood and then settled in the\r\n  skin; but, on the other hand, the entry may have been direct through\r\n  the skin.\r\n\r\n  In connection with the foregoing, reference should be made to a\r\n  communication by Whittles, insufficient from a zoological point of\r\n  view. In a case of hypertrophic gingivitis occurring in a female\r\n  patient, aged 19, who had never left Birmingham, he found Nematode\r\n  larvæ in the periosteum of the upper jaw, which was excised after\r\n  extraction of the right premolar; the genital rudiment could be\r\n  recognized in them. Similar larvæ were found in the same patient in\r\n  abscesses in various regions of the skin, and in the case of her\r\n  mother in the blood. The author considers that the infection took\r\n  place through a dog, and refers to the case of O’Neil (1875), who\r\n  found Filariæ in the skin (in the condition known as “craw-craw”),\r\n  referred by Manson to _Filaria perstans_. O’Neil’s case was quoted,\r\n  and attributed to _Filaria sanguinis hominis_. In conclusion, the\r\n  author states that he has repeatedly found Nematode larvæ in the\r\n  blood of persons who suffered from pruritus; in his opinion the\r\n  parasite had been imported through the agency of troops returned\r\n  from South Africa. Glatzel found true Filaria larvæ in a pustule of\r\n  a cutaneous eruption of the trunk and extremities in a patient at\r\n  Dar-es-Salam.\r\n\r\n  Skin diseases which are caused by young Nematodes are also observed\r\n  in dogs (Siedamgrotzky, Möller, J. G. Schneider, Künnemann),\r\n  foxes (Leuckart), and horses (Semmer). Zürn found young Nematodes\r\n  (_Anguillulidæ_) also in pig’s flesh. In Künnemann’s case it was\r\n  shown that the adult Rhabdites lived in the straw upon which the dog\r\n  lay.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Rhabditis*, sp.\r\n\r\n  In the fluid obtained by lavage from the stomach of a female\r\n  patient, aged 16, suffering from ozæna, O. Frese found during two\r\n  consecutive months Rhabdites of various ages, 0·275 to 0·64 mm. in\r\n  length, the adults all with eggs; males were not found; transmission\r\n  into rabbit’s stomach failed, but they could be kept alive in much\r\n  diluted hydrochloric acid (2 : 1,000) for several weeks. Neither eggs\r\n  nor larvæ appeared in the fæces of the patient. The nature of the\r\n  infection, which was perhaps of unique occurrence, remained doubtful.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Anguillula*, Ehrenberg, 1826.\r\n\r\n  Buccal cavity very small, without lips. Males without bursa, but with\r\n  a series of papillæ. Lateral lines absent.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Anguillula aceti*, Müller, 1783.\r\n\r\nCuticle unstriped, body cylindrical, anterior end tapering but little,\r\nposterior end long, pointed. Male up to 1·45 mm. long, 0·024 to\r\n0·028 mm. wide; two pre-anal papillæ, one post-anal; spicules equal,\r\ncurved, 0·038 mm. long; gubernaculum present; testis extending in front\r\nof mid-line of body. Female up to 2·4 mm. long, 0·040 to 0·072 mm.\r\nwide; anterior uterus reaching to near the œsophagus, posterior to hind\r\ngut. Viviparous; embryos in both or only in one uterine horn, 0·22 mm.\r\nlong, 0·012 mm. broad.\r\n\r\n  The species is a frequent inhabitant of vinegar (prepared by older\r\n  methods), and was once observed for some time by Stiles and Frankland\r\n  in the urine of a woman; the urine had an acid reaction, and once had\r\n  a distinct odour of vinegar. It was assumed that the patient, who\r\n  was hysterical and suffered from chronic nephritis, employed vaginal\r\n  douches with diluted vinegar, perhaps to deceive her physician or\r\n  to protect herself against conception. According to Ward, Billings\r\n  and Miller are said to have reported on two other cases. Ill-effects\r\n  which might be connected with the vinegar eel (_Anguillula aceti_)\r\n  were not present.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Anguillulina*, Gervais and Beneden, 1859.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Tylenchus_, Bastian, 1864.\r\n\r\n  Characterized by the possession in the buccal cavity of a spine\r\n  knobbed posteriorly; bursa present; uterus asymmetrical. Numerous\r\n  species parasitic in plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Anguillulina putrefaciens*, Kühn, 1879.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Tylenchus putrefaciens_, Kühn; _Trichina contorta_, Botkin,\r\n  1883.\r\n\r\n  In 1883 Botkin (_Pet. klin. Wochenschr_., 1883) found a small\r\n  Nematode, which was, however, entirely mistaken, in the material\r\n  vomited by a Russian; this was not a species of Trichinella, but an\r\n  _Anguillulina_ living in onions which had already, in 1879, been\r\n  described by Kühn as _Tylenchus putrefaciens_; the Nematodes got into\r\n  the stomach with the onions, causing nausea and vomiting.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Angiostomidæ*, Braun, 1895.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Strongyloides*, Grassi, 1879.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Pseudorhabditis_, Perroncito, 1881; _Rhabdonema_, Leuckart,\r\n  1882, _p.p._\r\n\r\n  The genus is insufficiently defined. The parasitic form possesses a\r\n  simple mouth opening directly into the long cylindrical œsophagus\r\n  which occupies the anterior third of the body. The free-living forms\r\n  possess a small buccal cavity; the œsophagus is short, with a double\r\n  bulb, in the hinder one there is a *Y*-shaped chitinous valve; two\r\n  spicules of equal size.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Strongyloides stercoralis*, Bavay, 1877.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Anguillula intestinalis_ et _stercoralis_, Bavay, 1877;\r\n  _Leptodera intestinalis_ et _stercoralis_, Cobb.; _Pseudorhabditis\r\n  stercoralis_, Perroncito, 1881; _Rhabdonema strongyloides_, Leuckart,\r\n  1883; _Strongyloides intestinalis_, Grassi, 1883; _Rhabdonema\r\n  intestinale_, Blanchard, 1886.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 270.--_Strongyloides stercoralis_, female:\r\nparasitic generation from gut of man. × 70. (After Looss.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 271.--_Strongyloides stercoralis_, male:\r\nfree-living generation. × 170. (After Looss.)]\r\n\r\n  In 1876, a number of French soldiers returned to Toulon from\r\n  Cochin China suffering from severe diarrhœa. Dr. Normand, under\r\n  whose treatment they were, discovered a large number of Nematodes\r\n  in the evacuated fæces, and Bavay described them as _Anguillula\r\n  stercoralis_. Soon after Normand, at the _post-mortem_ of five\r\n  patients who had died of Cochin China diarrhœa, found numerous other\r\n  Nematodes in the intestine, from the stomach to the rectum, in the\r\n  bile-ducts and in the pancreas, and these he handed over to Bavay.\r\n  The latter diagnosed another species, and described them as _A.\r\n  intestinalis_. Both forms were then regarded as the cause of Cochin\r\n  China diarrhœa until, in 1882, Leuckart was able to demonstrate\r\n  that the two forms are only two succeeding generations of the same\r\n  species, of which the one (_A. intestinalis_) lives parasitically in\r\n  the intestine, whereas its young (_A. stercoralis_) attain the open,\r\n  where they come to maturity and propagate. The young of these again\r\n  live parasitically. There thus exists the same heterogony as was\r\n  discovered by Leuckart in _Angiostomum nigrovenosum_ of frogs, which\r\n  heterogony, indeed, according to v. Linstow, appertains to the entire\r\n  family of the _Angiostomidæ_.\r\n\r\n(1) The parasitic generation (strongyloid or filariform ♀) is quite\r\ncolourless and cannot be seen _in situ_ even with a lens. To detect\r\nthem it is necessary to scrape the mucosa of the jejunum and examine\r\nthe scrapings microscopically. It measures 2·2 mm. in length, and 34 µ\r\nto 70 µ in breadth; the cuticle is finely transversely striated; the\r\nmouth is surrounded by four lips; the œsophagus is almost cylindrical\r\nand a third the length of the entire body. The anus opens shortly in\r\nfront of the pointed posterior extremity; the vulva is situated at\r\njunction of middle and posterior thirds of the body; the uterus has no\r\nspecial ovejector; the eggs measure 50 µ to 58 µ in length, and 30 µ to\r\n34 µ in breadth, and lie in a chain one behind the other (fig. 270).\r\nAs in the case of _Angiostomum nigrovenosum_, Leuckart considers this\r\nstage to be hermaphroditic, the testes degenerating after having\r\nfunctioned; other authors (Rovelli) regard it as a female reproducing\r\nby parthenogenesis.\r\n\r\n(2) The free-living generation (♂ and ♀) has a smooth body,\r\ncylindrical, somewhat more slender at the anterior extremity and\r\npointed at the tail end. The mouth has four indistinct lips; the\r\nœsophagus is short with a double (rhabditis-like) bulb; there is a\r\n*Y*-shaped valve in the posterior bulb; the anus opens in front of the\r\ntail end. The males measure 0·7 mm. in length, 0·035 mm. in breadth.\r\nTheir posterior end is rolled up; the two brown spicules are small\r\n(38 µ) and much curved. There is also a gubernaculum. The females\r\nmeasure 1 mm. in length or a little over; 0·05 mm. in breadth. The tail\r\nend is straight and pointed; the vulva lies somewhat behind the middle\r\nof the body. The yellowish, thin-shelled ova measure 70 µ in length and\r\n45 µ in breadth.\r\n\r\nAs Askanazy has shown, the parasitic form bores deeply into the\r\nmucous membrane of the intestine, and frequently into the epithelium\r\nof Lieberkühn’s glands, both for nourishment and oviposition. The\r\neggs then develop in the intestinal wall. The eggs which are found in\r\nscrapings from the mucosa occur, at least in the case of Strongyloides\r\nof the sheep, in chains enclosed in a thin tube or sheath, the origin\r\nof which is doubtful; possibly it is the uterus. The eggs themselves\r\nare only rarely found in stools, _e.g._, after a strong purge. The\r\nlarvæ, which are hatched out, and measure 0·2 to 0·25 mm. long by\r\n0·016 mm. broad, again reach the lumen of the intestine,[299] and\r\ngrow to double or three times that size, until they are passed out\r\nwith the fæces. They already differ from the parent (♀) in the shape\r\n(rhabditiform) of the œsophagus. When the external temperature is\r\nsufficiently high (26° to 35° C.), they become sexually mature after\r\nmoulting. In about thirty hours they are completely developed and\r\ncopulate, now forming the free-living rhabditiform generation. At lower\r\ntemperatures the larvæ only moult, but do not escape from the old\r\ncuticle and do not develop further. At a temperature of about 25° C.\r\nonly some of the larvæ attain maturity.\r\n\r\n[299] As a case published by Teissier shows, they may also abnormally\r\nappear in the blood (_Arch. méd. expér. et d’An. path._, 1895, vii,\r\np. 675).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 272.--_Strongyloides stercoralis_, female;\r\nfree-living generation, × 170. (After Looss.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 273.--_Strongyloides stercoralis_: larva from fresh\r\nhuman fæces. × 310. (After Looss.)]\r\n\r\nThe females of the free-living generation (rhabditiform) deposit\r\nfrom thirty to forty eggs, which develop rapidly, sometimes even\r\nwithin the uterus in the case of old females. After the larvæ have\r\nemerged from the egg-shell, they measure 0·22 mm. in length, and\r\npossess the characteristics of the parents (rhabditiform larvæ). When\r\nthey have grown to 0·55 mm. they moult, and while losing their own\r\ncharacteristics they acquire the characteristics of their parasitic\r\ngrandparents (strongyloid or filariform). After about eight days the\r\nfree-living adult generation in the cultures have disappeared, and\r\nall the rhabditiform larvæ have been transformed into strongyloid or\r\nfilariform larvæ; they then die off unless they reach the intestine.\r\n\r\nThis cycle of development holds good for _Strongyloides stercoralis_ of\r\ntropical origin (Bavay, Leuckart, Leichtenstern, Zinn). In the European\r\nStrongyloides the free-living generation, as a rule, is absent (Grassi,\r\nSonsino, Leichtenstern, Braun); the rhabditis-like larvæ evacuated with\r\nthe fæces are transformed into the strongyloid or filariform type of\r\nlarva (in cultures which are easily made) which will only become adult\r\nif introduced into man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 274.--_Strongyloides stercoralis_: mature\r\nfilariform larva showing long transparent œsophagus, slender granular\r\nintestine and characteristic tip to the tail ending in two small\r\npoints. × 620. (After Looss).]\r\n\r\nSo that we have these two cycles: (_A_) (1) ♀ parasitic, (2) eggs, the\r\nrhabditiform larvæ in fæces, (3) free-living strongyloid or filariform\r\nlarva, (4) ♀ parasitic. (_B_) (1) (2) (3) as before, then (4) adult ♀\r\nand ♂, free living, (5) eggs, (6) rhabditiform larva, (7) strongyloid\r\nor filariform larva, (8) ♀ parasitic.\r\n\r\nInfection of man results not only from direct entry into the stomach\r\nbut also, according to van Durme and Looss, through the skin.\r\n\r\n  _Occurrence in Man._--As already mentioned, _Strongyloides\r\n  stercoralis_ was first observed in persons suffering from so-called\r\n  Cochin China diarrhœa. From the enormous numbers of parasites\r\n  evacuated with the fæces, the cause of the disease was apparently\r\n  evident. It appeared, however, that only some of the soldiers\r\n  returning from Cochin China and Martinique, and suffering from\r\n  diarrhœa, harboured Strongyloides (Chauvin). Breton made the same\r\n  observations in Cochin China and found that only 10·4 per cent. of\r\n  cases of chronic dysentery, and 8·8 per cent. of chronic diarrhœa,\r\n  show Strongyloides. Normand, moreover, found that only a few of the\r\n  Europeans residing in Cochin China are exempt from _S. intestinalis_,\r\n  yet the people exhibit no intestinal symptoms; if, however, from any\r\n  cause a catarrhal condition of the intestine supervenes the condition\r\n  is changed, the parasites appear in larger numbers, and the disorder\r\n  is considerably intensified.\r\n\r\n  _S. intestinalis_, besides being present in the Indo-China region,\r\n  also occurs in the Antilles, in Brazil, Africa, and Europe; in 1878\r\n  it was discovered in Italy by Grassi and C. and E. Parona; in 1880 it\r\n  was also found in the labourers working at the St. Gothard tunnel. It\r\n  was imported into Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands by Italian\r\n  labourers. One sporadic case has been observed in East Prussia, and\r\n  the worm has also been reported from Siberia.\r\n\r\n  In mammals the following species are found: _Probstmayria_\r\n  (_Strongyloides_) _vivipara_, Ransom, 1907, in _Equus caballus_;\r\n  _Strongyloides fülleborni_, v. Linst., in _Anthropopithecus\r\n  troglodytes_ and _Cynocephalus babuin_.\r\n\r\n  Their development is, so far as is known, the same as that of\r\n  _Strongyloides stercoralis_ (v. Linstow, _Centralbl. f. Bakt., Path.\r\n  u. Infektionsk._, 1905, Orig. xxxviii, p. 532).\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Gnathostomidæ.*\r\n\r\nGenus. *Gnathostoma*, Owen, 1836.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Cheiracanthus_, Diesing, 1839.\r\n\r\n  Easily recognizable by the numerous spines which cover the entire\r\n  body or only the anterior extremity, and terminate in several points;\r\n  head globular and beset with bristles; mouth with two lips; two\r\n  spicules; vulva situated behind the middle of the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Gnathostoma siamense*, Levinsen, 1889.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Cheiracanthus siamense_, Lev., 1889.\r\n\r\nFemale measures 9 mm. in length, 1 mm. in breadth. There are eight\r\nrows of simple spines on the head; the armature of spines extends over\r\nthe anterior third of the body only; each spine on the anterior region\r\nof the body spreads into three points, of which the middle one is the\r\nlongest; the posterior spines are simple; they gradually become smaller\r\nand then disappear entirely. The vulva is situated behind the middle of\r\nthe body.\r\n\r\n_Male._--10·5 mm. long by 0·6 mm. broad. Head terminates in a globular\r\nswelling with two large lips. Neck 3 mm. broad. In front of neck eight\r\nrows of simple spines directed backwards. Anterior half of body with\r\ncuticular laminæ, posterior unarmed. Two pre-anal and two post-anal\r\npapillæ. Bursa wanting.\r\n\r\nSpicules 1·1 and 0·4 mm. respectively.\r\n\r\nLeiper considers _Gnathostoma siamense_ to be identical with\r\n_Gnathostoma spinigerum_.\r\n\r\n  The single specimen described by Levinsen was found by Deuntzer in\r\n  Bangkok (Siam), and was obtained from a young Siamese woman who\r\n  suffered from a small tumour of the breast which had developed in the\r\n  course of a few days. After the disappearance of the tumour, nodules\r\n  the size of beans were found in the skin; out of one of these the\r\n  worm was obtained. The same observer saw this affection in two other\r\n  persons.\r\n\r\n  A closely related species, _Gnathostoma spinigerum_, Ow., lives in\r\n  the stomach of wild cat (_Felis catus_), puma (_Felis concolor_),\r\n  tiger (_Felis tigris_), and domestic cat (India); another species,\r\n  _Gnathostoma hispidum_, Fedsch., 1839, in the stomach of pigs in\r\n  Turkestan, Annam, Hungary, Congo, and by Collin in the stomach of an\r\n  ox (Berlin).\r\n\r\n  _Gnathostoma_ sp. in pariah dogs, Calcutta. _Gnathostoma_ sp. in\r\n  monkeys, French Guiana. They produce large fibrous thickenings in the\r\n  stomach wall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 275.--_Gnathostoma siamense_: to the left, the\r\nentire worm (8/1); to the right the head seen from above, with two\r\nfleshy lips (about 40/1).

Mouth\r\ntriangular with two lips. Alimentary canal atrophied.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Dracunculus medinensis*, Velsch, 1674.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Vena medinensis_, Velsch, 1674; _Dracunculus persarum_,\r\n  Kämpfer, 1694; _Gordius medinensis_, Linné, 1758; _Filaria\r\n  dracunculus_, Bremser, 1819; _Filaria æthiopica_, Valenciennes, 1856;\r\n  _Dracunculus medinensis_, Cobbold, 1864; _Guinea worm_, _Medina worm_.\r\n\r\nThe females attain a length of 50 to 80 cm., or even more, and average\r\n1·5 to 1·7 mm. in diameter. They are whitish or yellowish in colour.\r\nThe anterior extremity is roundish and bears a cuticular thickening or\r\nshield. The triangular mouth opening is surrounded by two projections\r\nor lips, behind which on the shield there are two lateral and four\r\nsub-median papillæ; the posterior end terminates in a spine, ventrally\r\ndirected, and about 1 mm. in length; the alimentary canal below the\r\nœsophagus is atrophied, but not entirely obliterated; anus absent; the\r\nlateral lines are very flat. The greater part of the body is occupied\r\nby the long uterus, in which a great number of young larvæ are always\r\nfound. The ovaries probably lie at the ends of the uterus; the vulva\r\nlies just behind the cephalic shield. During parturition the uterus is\r\nprolapsed through this opening.\r\n\r\nThe male is almost unknown. Leiper in an experimentally infected monkey\r\nfound two males 22 mm. long, one from the psoas muscle, the other from\r\nthe connective tissue behind the œsophagus.\r\n\r\n  _Occurrence._--_Filaria medinensis_ has been known since the most\r\n  remote period. The “fiery serpents” that molested the Israelites by\r\n  the Red Sea, and which Moses mentioned, were probably filariæ. The\r\n  term Δρακὁντιον occurs in Agatharchides (140 B.C.). Galen called\r\n  the disorder dracontiasis; the Arabian authors were well acquainted\r\n  with the worm. It is found not only in Medina or Arabia, but also\r\n  in Persia, Turkestan, Hindustan. The Guinea worm is also widely\r\n  distributed in Africa, on the coasts as well as in the interior. It\r\n  occurs in the Fiji Islands. It was carried to South America by negro\r\n  slaves, but is said at the present time to exist in only quite a\r\n  few places (British Guiana, Brazil [Bahia]); it is also observed in\r\n  mammals (ox, horse, dog, leopard, jackal [_Canis lapuster_], etc.).\r\n\r\n_Dracunculus medinensis_ in its adult stage lives in superficial\r\nulcers on the body surface; it is seen most frequently on the lower\r\nextremities, more especially in the region of the ankle, but it also\r\noccurs in other parts of the body--on the trunk, scrotum, perineum, on\r\nthe upper extremities, and in the eyelids and tongue. Sometimes there\r\nis only one ulcer and one worm, but more commonly several. It attacks\r\nman without distinction of race, age or sex. It is observed most\r\nfrequently during the months of June to August.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 276.--Guinea worm (_Dracunculus medinensis_).\r\n(After Leuckart.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 277.--Anterior extremity of Guinea worm, showing\r\ndorsal and ventral lips, one lateral and two submedian papillæ and the\r\nlateral line. (After Leuckart.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 278.--_Dracunculus medinensis_. _a_, anterior\r\nextremity seen end on; O, mouth; P, papillæ; _b_, female reduced more\r\nthan half; _c_, larvæ enlarged. (After Claus.)]\r\n\r\n_Life history._[300]--When about a year old the worm seeks the\r\nsurface of the body and produces there a thickening as big as a\r\nflorin. Over this a vesicle forms which eventually ruptures, and at the\r\nbottom of the ulcer can be seen a hole from which a part of the worm\r\nmay project. On bathing the sides of the ulcer with water, a drop of\r\nfluid, at first clear then milky, exudes. This contains numerous larvæ.\r\nIn other cases a thin tube an inch long is prolapsed (through the\r\nvulva). This is probably the uterus, but the mechanism of parturition\r\nis not clearly known. It lasts for about a fortnight. An abundant\r\nsupply of larvæ can be got by placing wet compresses on a _fresh_\r\nulcer. In a few hours a mass of larvæ is obtained.\r\n\r\n[300] The larvæ resemble those of _Cucullanus elegans_ parasitic in\r\nthe perch (_Perca fluviatilis_). The larvæ of this species develop in\r\nCyclops sp. Fedschenko in 1870, at Leuckart’s suggestion, succeeded in\r\nobserving the invasion of Cyclops by Guinea worm larvae. They penetrate\r\nnot _per os_ but through the exoskeleton. Newly hatched larvæ (in\r\nbananas) will cause infection of monkeys.\r\n\r\nThe larvæ are 500 µ to 750 µ by 15 µ to 25 µ, with a long slender\r\ntail about one-third of the total length. The cuticle is transversely\r\nstriated. The body is flattened. They possess an œsophagus and gut. At\r\nthe anus there are apparently glandular structures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 279.--Transverse section of female Guinea worm;\r\n_u._, uterus containing embryos; _i._, intestinal canal; _o._, ovary.\r\n(After Leuckart.)]\r\n\r\nThe larvæ live and move actively in water for about two days, the\r\nmajority dying on the third (Leiper). If a number of Cyclops sp. have\r\nbeen collected and isolated in clean water, and the larvæ are now\r\nadded, the further development can be traced.\r\n\r\nThe larvæ enter the Cyclops, according to most authorities, by\r\npenetrating the exoskeleton, but according to Leiper this is\r\nimpossible; they must enter by the mouth and penetrate the gut in\r\norder to reach the body cavity. In eight days moult 1 takes place, the\r\nstriated cuticle being cast off. In ten days moult 2 takes place. In\r\nfive weeks the larva is mature. If now the infected Cyclops is placed\r\nin 0·2 per cent. HCl solution the Cyclops is killed immediately, but\r\nthe larvæ are stirred into activity, escape from the body, and swim\r\nabout in the acid. This suggests that infection in nature probably\r\ntakes place by the swallowing of infected Cyclops; Leiper, by feeding\r\nCyclops containing mature larvæ to a monkey, found in it, _post mortem_\r\nsix months later, two immature females 30 cm. long and two males 22 mm.\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nIn certain areas the new cases occur principally in June. Five weeks\r\nlater the larvæ will become mature in Cyclops, so that infection of\r\nCyclops is taking place in July or August, and from then to June about\r\nten months elapse, giving the period of development in man.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._--The initial induration is accompanied by itching.\r\nUrticarial eruptions are described in Dahomey and Mauretania\r\naccompanied by fever, rigors, blood-shot conjunctiva, and prostration\r\nresembling fungus poisoning. Symptoms last for one to two days, later\r\nthe worms appear on the surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 280.--_Cyclops virescens_, ♀. 8, Female, ventral\r\nview, × 120; 9, anterior antennæ × 240; 10, urosome and last thoracic\r\nsegment, × 240; 11, foot of first pair, × 320; 12, 15, 16, foot of\r\nsecond, third and fourth pairs, × 240; 14, foot of fifth pair, × 440;\r\n13, last thoracic segment and first segment of urosome of male, × 240.]\r\n\r\nIf the worm is ruptured in an attempt to extract it, disastrous results\r\nmay occur through the escape of the larvæ into the tissues: fever,\r\ninflammation, abscess, sloughing, ankylosis, even death from sepsis.\r\nEosinophilia is often marked, 11 to 13 or even 50 per cent.\r\n\r\n_Extraction._--(1) The native method consists in rolling the worm round\r\na stick; 1 in. to 2 in. are extracted each day, the process taking\r\nabout a fortnight; (2) Emily used injections of 1 in 1,000 sublimate\r\ninto the swelling or into the worm itself fixed by a ligature. (3)\r\nBéclère chloroforms the worm; (4) the worm can be more easily removed\r\nwhen all the embryos have been deposited (two to three weeks).\r\n\r\n_Cyclopidæ._--Cephalothorax ovate, clearly separated from abdomen.\r\nAnterior antennæ of female when bent back scarcely ever stretch beyond\r\nthe cephalothorax. The second antennæ are unbranched. First four pairs\r\nof feet two-branched, outer branches three-jointed. The fifth pair of\r\nlimbs are rudimentary alike in both sexes, usually one-jointed. There\r\nis no heart. The female has two egg sacs containing about fifty eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Cyclops*, Müller, 1776.\r\n\r\nMandible palp rudimentary, reduced to a tubercle bearing two branchial\r\nfilaments. Maxillary palp rudimentary (obsolete). Lower foot-jaw\r\nnon-prehensile. Head ankylosed to first thoracic segment.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Filariidæ.*\r\n\r\nSub-family. *Filariinæ.*\r\n\r\nThe residue after exclusion of the _Arduenninæ_ and _Onchocercinæ_.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Filaria*, O. Fr. Müller, 1787.\r\n\r\nVery long, slender Nematodes, without excretory vessels or excretory\r\npore, the males of which are usually considerably smaller than the\r\nfemales. Mouth round, without lips, unarmed. The lateral lines occupy\r\none-sixth of the circumference of body. The tails of the males are\r\nbent or spirally rolled, and bear little wing-like appendages. The two\r\nspicules are unequal; almost always there are four pre-anal papillæ,\r\nbut the number of post-anal papillæ varies. The vulva is always\r\nsituated at the anterior extremity. Parasitic chiefly in the serous\r\ncavities and in the subcutaneous connective tissue. Insufficiently\r\ndefined.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Filaria bancrofti*, Cobbold, 1877.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Trichina cystica_, Salisbury,[301] 1868 (_nec Filaria\r\n  cystica_, Rud., 1819); _Filaria sanguinis hominis_, Lewis, 1872;\r\n  _Filaria sanguinis hominis ægyptiaca_, Sonsino, 1875; _Filaria\r\n  wüchereri_, da Silva Lima; _Filaria sanguinis hominum_, Hall,\r\n  1885; _Filaria sanguinis hominis nocturna_, Manson, 1891; _Filaria\r\n  nocturna_, Manson, 1891.\r\n\r\n[301] C. W. Stiles (“American Medicine,” 1905, ix, p. 682) is of the\r\nopinion that Salisbury’s _Trichina cystica_ is identical with _Oxyuris\r\nvermicularis_.\r\n\r\n  These parasites of man were for a long time only known in their\r\n  larval stage. They were discovered in 1863 in Paris by Demarquay, in\r\n  the hydrocele fluid of a Havanese emptied by puncture; they were next\r\n  observed by Wücherer, in Bahia, in the urine of twenty-eight cases\r\n  of tropical chyluria; they were likewise observed in North America\r\n  by Salisbury, who gave them the name of _Trichina cystica_. The next\r\n  discoveries (in Calcutta, Guadeloupe, and Port Natal) related to\r\n  chyluria patients, until Lewis discovered the larvæ in the blood of\r\n  man (India), and found they were almost always present in persons\r\n  suffering from chyluria, elephantiasis, and lymphatic enlargements;\r\n  he also, in exceptional cases, found them in apparently healthy\r\n  persons (_Filaria sanguinis hominis_). Lewis and Manson studied the\r\n  disease and the filariæ of the blood very minutely, and became aware\r\n  that the filariæ were sucked up by mosquitoes with the blood. Manson\r\n  described the metamorphoses that take place within the body of the\r\n  mosquito. The adult female was discovered in Queensland by Bancroft,\r\n  and soon after Lewis found it in Calcutta; it was described by\r\n  Cobbold as _F. bancrofti_. The male was first seen by Bourne in 1888.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 281.--_Filaria bancrofti._ 1, Anterior portion\r\nof male; 2, two rows of papillæ on head; 3, papillæ of tail of male;\r\n4, cloaca of male showing tips of spicules and gubernaculum; 5, the\r\nspicules and gubernaculum of male. (After Leiper.)]\r\n\r\nHead bougie-like, _i.e._, separated by a narrowing from the neck,\r\nhaving two rows of minute papillæ. Cuticle has extremely fine\r\nstriations.\r\n\r\n_Female._--50 to 65 mm. long by 1·5 to 2 mm. broad. Vulva 0·4 to\r\n0·7 mm. behind the head. Anus about 1/4 mm. from the tip of the tail\r\n(vulva 1 to 1·3 mm. from head, and anus 0·17 to 28 mm. from tail\r\naccording to other authors). The vagina is a muscular tube forming\r\nthree bold loops, and has terminally a pyriform enlargement. Uterus\r\ndouble (or single). Ovoviviparous.\r\n\r\n_Male._--25 to 30 mm. long by 0·1 mm. thick (40 by 0·1 mm. according\r\nto various authors). Probably two pairs of pre-anal papillæ, eight\r\npairs of peri-anal, two pairs of post-anal papillæ, and one pair\r\nterminal. Tail curved. Two spicules, 0·2 and 0·6 mm. respectively, and\r\na cup-like gubernaculum. The long spicule is cylindrical, expanded\r\nproximally and tapering distally to a filament with wings. At the tip\r\nit is spoon-like. The short spicule is of the same diameter throughout.\r\nIt is gutter-like, coarsely marked. Testis uncoiled, terminating in a\r\nsnowdrop-like process (Leiper).\r\n\r\n_Eggs._--40 µ by 25 µ. They do not appear to possess a true shell, but\r\nonly an embryonal or vitelline membrane secreted by the ovum.\r\n\r\n_Embryos._--In the posterior part of the uterus eggs occur, in the\r\nanterior part embryos; the larvæ at birth measure 127 µ to 200 µ by 8µ\r\nto 10 µ. In the blood they measure in the fresh 260 µ by 7·5 µ to 8 µ.\r\nIn stained films, owing to shrinkage, there is great variation in size,\r\nfrom 154 µ to 311 µ. Probably 260 µ to 285 µ is the average in stained\r\nfilms.\r\n\r\n_Geographical Distribution._--Europe: Two cases recorded, one from\r\nnear Barcelona. The patient suffered from hæmato-chyluria and enlarged\r\nscrotum with mikrofilariæ in the blood. A second case from Siena.\r\nAfrica: The filarial index has not been estimated for various parts. In\r\nNigeria it is about 10 per cent.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Lymphatic glands: _e.g._, inguinal, femoral, iliac, lumbar,\r\nmesenteric, bronchial, superficial cervical, epitrochlear.\r\n\r\nLymphatic vessels: _e.g._, those draining into the receptaculum chyli\r\nof the spermatic cord, in the thoracic duct and in various different\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nOrgans, etc.: Testis, epididymis, spermatic cord, tunica vaginalis,\r\nmammary cyst, and in abscesses.\r\n\r\nThey may occur in masses, but usually only a few (one to eight).\r\nFemales are commoner than males. Dead and calcified worms are common in\r\nthe various sites.\r\n\r\n_Distribution of Larvæ in Body._--These are by no means uniformly\r\ndistributed, but occur in greater number in the capillaries of the\r\nlungs. Besides the lungs they occur in the capillaries of other organs,\r\nas the following data of Rodenwaldt show:--\r\n\r\n              Mikrofilariæ                    Mikrofilariæ\r\n  Lungs         134,821†         Spleen          1,666\r\n  Liver           4,884          Brain           3,833\r\n  Kidneys        15,253          Glands              0\r\n  {Glomeruli      8,008          Marrow              0\r\n  {Parenchyma     7,245          Blood           3,000\r\n\r\n  † These figures refer to 1 c.c. of each organ, and were estimated by\r\n  cutting sections of definite thickness (30 µ to 40 µ) and counting\r\n  the filariæ in a definite area of section, _e.g._, 1/4 cm.^2 The\r\n  organs before removal from the body have their vessels tied, and are\r\n  then fixed in hot alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe following data of Rodenwaldt refer to the larvæ of _Filaria\r\nimmitis_ in the dog. They are commoner in organs than in vessels, and\r\nespecially in the _capillaries_ of the organs, but in the lungs they\r\nappear to be equally distributed in capillaries, arteries and veins.\r\n\r\nThe length of life of larvæ is unknown, but they appear to be destroyed\r\nin the kidneys, as dead calcified specimens are fairly numerous in the\r\ncapillaries of the vasa recta of the medullary substance.\r\n\r\nKidneys: mainly in the glomerular capillaries and those of the vasa\r\nrecta.\r\n\r\nLiver: in the capillaries of the portal system, especially in those\r\nbetween the interlobular and the central intralobular veins.\r\n\r\n_Periodicity of Larvæ._[302]--Roughly speaking, the larvæ of _Filaria\r\nbancrofti_ are found in the peripheral blood only during the night,\r\ndisappearing (but not entirely) during the daytime. Their periodicity\r\nand that of _Loa loa_ larvæ is shown by the table on p. 394, based on\r\nthat of Smith and Rivas (_Amer. Journ. Trop. Dis. and Prev. Med._,\r\n1914, vol. iii, p. 361).\r\n\r\n[302] For determining periodicity measured quantities of blood,\r\n_e.g._., 20 mm.^3, should be used. A thick film is made of the whole\r\nquantity. The numbers present in this quantity may vary from three or\r\nfour to 300 or 400.\r\n\r\nIt was discovered by Mackenzie that this periodicity could be\r\nreversed by making the patient sleep during the daytime, showing that\r\nthe phenomenon was in some way dependent on sleep or its attendant\r\nphenomena. Rodenwaldt gives the following explanation of the phenomenon\r\nof periodicity:--\r\n\r\nMikrofilariæ come to rest in capillaries. After passing up the thoracic\r\nduct they would reach the capillaries of the lungs by the superior vena\r\ncava. Here they occur in immense numbers. In the case of _Loa loa_\r\nlarvæ (which have a diurnal periodicity) some of these are forced out\r\nby the increased force and rapidity of the pulmonary circulation during\r\nthe day, but are able to rest (owing to their sticky sheath?) in the\r\nperipheral capillaries on their way to the capillaries of the organs.\r\nDuring the night the force of the current through the lungs is relaxed\r\nand consequently they are able to remain in the pulmonary capillaries\r\nand do not appear in the capillaries of the systemic circulation. If\r\nit is true that the periodicity of _Loa loa_ cannot be reversed by\r\nchanging the hours of sleep, then the explanation is incomplete. In\r\nthe case of the larvæ of _Filaria bancrofti_ (which have a nocturnal\r\nperiodicity), in order to apply the same explanation we must further\r\nassume that the mikrofilariæ have less power of resisting the force of\r\nthe capillary current (_i.e._, are less sticky). They are washed out of\r\nthe pulmonary capillaries by day and by night, but it is only at night,\r\nwhen the blood stream in systemic capillaries is less rapid, that they\r\nare able to rest there. In the daytime they are washed on until they\r\nreach the capillaries of the organs (possibly again the lungs). The\r\nreversal of the periodicity by sleeping during the daytime admits of a\r\nsimilar explanation. If this explanation be true, then a prolongation\r\nof the day conditions, _e.g._, by continued exercise, should result\r\nin still keeping the larvæ out of the circulation, but this does not\r\nappear to be the case.\r\n\r\n  --------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n          | Larvæ of | Average  | CASE 1.  | Average  | CASE 2.  | Average\r\n          | _L.loa_  |   132.   |   _F.    |  1,000   |   _F.    |  1,570\r\n          | in equal |Deviations|bancrofti_| (about). |bancrofti_| (about).\r\n          |quantities|  from    |  larvæ   |Deviations|  larvæ   |Deviations\r\n          | of blood | average  |in 1 c.c. |   from   |in 1 c.c. |   from\r\n          |          |          | of blood | average  | of blood | average\r\n  --------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n   2 a.m. |      9   |  - 123   |   3,500  | +  2,500 |   6,500  | + 3,930\r\n   4 a.m. |     11   |  - 121   |   3,200  | +  2,200 |   5,200  | + 3,630\r\n   6 a.m. |     41   |  -  91   |   2,800  | +  1,800 |   2,000  | +   430\r\n   8 a.m. |    168   |  +  36   |     900  | -    100 |   1,100  | -   470\r\n  10 a.m. |    298   |  + 166   |     210  | -    790 |     350  | - 1,220\r\n  12 noon |    531   |  + 389   |      30  | -    970 |      50  | - 1,520\r\n   2 p.m. |    252   |  + 120   |      20  | -    980 |      40  | - 1,530\r\n   4 p.m. |    146   |  +  14   |      10  | -    990 |      30  | - 1,540\r\n   6 p.m. |     91   |  -  41   |      40  | -    960 |      40  | - 1,530\r\n   8 p.m. |     23   |  -  99   |      60  | -    940 |     100  | - 1,470\r\n  10 p.m. |      5   |  - 127   |     600  | -    400 |     800  |   - 770\r\n  12 mid- |      5   |  - 127   |     750  | -    250 |   2,600  | + 1,030\r\n     night|          |          |          |          |          |\r\n  --------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n    Total |  1,580   |    --    |  12,120  |    --    |  18,810  |    --\r\n  --------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n\r\nIn certain countries, _e.g._, Fiji, Samoa, Philippines, West Africa,\r\nlarvæ, apparently those of _Filaria bancrofti_, show no periodicity.\r\nIn Fiji the usual intermediate host is _Stegomyia pseudoscutellaris_,\r\na day-biting mosquito, so that possibly, as Bahr suggests, the\r\nmikrofilariæ have partly adapted themselves to the habits of their\r\nintermediate host, as the nocturnal mikrofilariæ are adapted for\r\ntransmission by a nocturnal feeding mosquito, _e.g._, _Culex fatigans_,\r\nbut how this could come about is a mystery. It is not certain in all\r\ncases whether the non-periodic mikrofilariæ really belong to _Filaria\r\nbancrofti_; some may be _L. loa_ larvæ, or possibly unknown larvæ. An\r\nexact morphological description of these larvæ is therefore always\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n_Preservation of Living Larvæ._--Blood from the vein (or finger\r\npuncture) is shaken up with twenty times its volume of sterile 0·9 per\r\ncent. salt solution, and kept in an ice cupboard (Fülleborn).\r\n\r\n_Concentration of Larvæ._--(_a_) The above mixture is hæmolysed with\r\nwater and then sufficient salt solution added to make up to 0·9 per\r\ncent. The solution is allowed to stand or can be centrifugalized. (_b_)\r\nThe blood is mixed with sodium citrate and centrifugalized; the larvæ\r\nare found in the leucocytic layer (Bahr). (_c_) Allow blood to clot in\r\na small tube; the larvæ appear on the surface of the clot and are so\r\ngot in pure serum. A drop of blood may also be allowed to clot on the\r\nslide; the larvæ are found in the clear areas of serum. (_d_) Hæmolyse\r\nblood with water or acetic acid. Centrifugalize, make smears from, or\r\nexamine the sediment.\r\n\r\n_Removal of Red Corpuscles._--The blood film is allowed to stand for\r\nsome minutes in a moist atmosphere. The staining solution is sucked\r\nthrough with blotting paper: the larvæ stick to the slide, while the\r\ncorpuscles are washed out.\r\n\r\n_Morphology of Larvæ._--Wet staining: Azur II one part, 0·9 per cent.,\r\nsalt solution 3,000, or very dilute Giemsa or ripened methylene blue\r\nor neutral red solutions. Place a drop on the slide and add a drop\r\nof blood to this. The larvæ remain alive for one or more days; it\r\nsometimes takes twenty-four hours to stain some particular structure.\r\nDifferentiation by drawing through weak eosin solution is often useful.\r\nThis method is the best for finest details. The excretory pore, anal\r\npore, excretory cell, and chief “genital” cell stain first, then the\r\nmatrix cells and finally the column of nuclei.\r\n\r\nWet fixation and staining: The blood is spread on a large\r\ncover-glass--floated on the surface of 70 per cent. alcohol heated\r\nto about 70° C. Wash in water, (1) overstain with 1 in 1,000 azur II\r\nsolution, warming slightly; (2) differentiate with (_a_) absolute\r\nalcohol (containing, if necessary, a trace of HCl), or (_b_) with\r\nabsolute alcohol 96 per cent. ninety parts, anilin oil ten parts; (3)\r\nclear in origanum, bergamot or cajeput oil; (4) mount in balsam. Or\r\nstain with hæmatoxylin, _e.g._, Mayer’s glycerine alumhæmatein, heating\r\ntill slightly steaming. Differentiate with acid (2 per cent. HCl)\r\nalcohol if overstained. Clear and mount as above.\r\n\r\nDry fixation and staining: (1) With azur II as above, or (2) with\r\nhæmatein (warm). Examine the dried films in the usual way without a\r\ncover-glass. The azur stains the excretory and genital cells clearly.\r\n\r\nThick films: (1) The blood is smeared out fairly thickly over an area\r\nas big as a sixpence.\r\n\r\n(2) Dry _quickly_ to prevent shrinking, using carefully a spirit lamp\r\nin a moist climate.\r\n\r\n(3) Place films downwards in water for a few minutes.\r\n\r\n(4) Fix in alcohol.\r\n\r\n(5) Stain with azur II, 1 in 1,000. Differentiate as above. Examine as\r\na dry film. This method suffices for showing the excretory cell and the\r\nG1 cell; or\r\n\r\n(6) Stain with hæmatein (slightly steaming), especially for the column\r\nof nuclei and the sheath. The fixation in alcohol in this case may be\r\nomitted.\r\n\r\n(7) The removal of the hæmoglobin and the fixation may be combined by\r\nusing Ruge’s mixture (formalin 2 per cent., containing 1 per cent.\r\nacetic acid) or acetic alcohol (glacial acetic 1, alcohol 3).[303]\r\n\r\n[303] [Acetic alcohol does well for detecting crescents in thick films\r\nof malaria blood.--J. W. W. S.]\r\n\r\n_Structure of Larvæ._--(1) Subcuticular cells: By vital staining, at\r\nintervals underneath the cuticle are seen a series of spindle-shaped\r\ncells--the _subcuticular matrix cells_ of Rodenwaldt, the _muscle\r\ncells_ of Fülleborn. There are thirty or forty or more of these.\r\n\r\n(2) Nerve ring: Appears as a break in the nuclear column about 20 per\r\ncent. of total length from the head.\r\n\r\n(3) Excretory system: Consists of a lateral spherical hollow excretory\r\npore which shows a radial striation. Connected with the pore is an\r\nexcretory cell which appears to be canalized. _Excretory pore_, 29·6\r\nper cent. of length from head. _Excretory cell_, 30·6 per cent. of\r\nlength from head.\r\n\r\n(4) “Genital” cells and anal pore: Consists of a pore opening ventrally\r\non a very fine papilla with which are connected four other cells in\r\nseries, the chief “genital” cell (G1) being some distance from the\r\nthree others, which lie close to the pore. G1, 70·6 per cent., anal\r\npore, 82·4 per cent. of length from head.\r\n\r\n(5) Internal body, viscus, or reserve material: Best shown by vital\r\nstaining with neutral red. This is a granular strand-like body\r\nextending from 52·7 per cent. to 65 per cent. of length from head.\r\n\r\n(6) Tail end: (i) Rod-like structures resembling those in the head, 90\r\nper cent. of length. (ii) The column of nuclei extends to 95 per cent.\r\nof length, so that the terminal portion is free from nuclei.\r\n\r\n(7) Mouth: Terminal according to some authors, lateral according to\r\nothers. Some describe a fang on the head, others not. By vital staining\r\nand eosin differentiation two rod-like structures with mushroom-like\r\ncaps can be seen behind the head.\r\n\r\n(8) Cuticle: Transversely striated. There is a longitudinal break\r\nin the striation on each side corresponding to the lateral lines.\r\nThe striation is best shown by vital staining with azur II and eosin\r\ndifferentiation.\r\n\r\n(9) Column of nuclei: These nuclei of the gut cells form the main\r\nfeature in ordinary dry films stained with hæmatoxylin. They are\r\nseparated by a space from the subcuticular cells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 282.--_Mf. bancrofti_ in thick film, dried and\r\nstained with hæmatoxylin: 1, shrunken; 2, unshrunken. × 1,000.

In twenty-four hours\r\nthe majority have reached the thoracic muscles, where development\r\nproceeds. They are at first immobile and of a “sausage” form (110µ by\r\n13 µ), with a short spiky tail. In three to five days the œsophagus is\r\nformed, the larva now being 0·5 mm. long. The larva appears to moult at\r\nthis time. After the gut is formed papillæ, three or four in number,\r\nappear at the tail end. In two to three weeks the larvæ are 1·5 mm.\r\nlong. They now leave the thorax and reach the labium, but they may be\r\nfound in various parts of the body, _e.g._, the legs. They bore through\r\nDutton’s membrane and so arrive on the surface of the skin, which they\r\nrapidly enter. Their development in man is unknown, but it may be very\r\nlong, as children are not infected till 4 to 5, or even 10 years old,\r\nbut this may be due to unknown causes.\r\n\r\nDevelopment takes place in numerous mosquitoes.

The evidence that these so-called\r\n“filarial diseases” are produced by _F. bancrofti_ is (1) geographical\r\nand statistical; (2) pathological. Bahr has contributed evidence of\r\nthe former kind from his researches in Fiji, on which we may base the\r\nfollowing statements:--\r\n\r\n(1) The prevalence of filarial diseases is proportional to the\r\nprevalence of _Mikrofilaria bancrofti_ in the blood. Thus in four\r\nvillages examined by him he got the following figures:--\r\n\r\n                     Village A    Village B    Village C    Village D\r\n                     per cent.    per cent.    per cent.    per cent.\r\n  _Mf. bancrofti_        12·5         25           31           33\r\n  Filarial diseases      29           39           58           34\r\n  Total population      168          114          425          222\r\n\r\n(2) Out of 257 people with _Mf. bancrofti_ in the blood, 153 were\r\nsuffering from filarial diseases, _i.e._, 59 per cent.\r\n\r\n(3) Whereas of 672 people without _Mf. bancrofti_ in the blood, only\r\n263 were suffering from filarial diseases, _i.e._, 37·6 per cent.\r\n\r\n(4) Again out of 416 people suffering from filarial disease, 153 showed\r\n_Mf. bancrofti_ in their blood, _i.e._, 36·7 per cent.\r\n\r\nIt is generally assumed that all people suffering from filarial\r\ndisease show at some (presumably early) stage larvæ in the blood; but\r\nwe do not consider that this must necessarily be so. It appears to us\r\nquite possible that living adult filariæ may be present in the body,\r\nproducing disease, without their larvæ appearing in the blood. The\r\nabsence of larvæ from the blood in 63·3 per cent. of persons suffering\r\nfrom filarial disease is, however, generally explained otherwise. The\r\nadults which occur in enlarged glands, etc., get eventually destroyed\r\nby inflammatory reaction, so that larvæ are no longer being produced,\r\nwhile the enlarged gland, etc., which the adults have produced remains.\r\nThis explanation assumes that the larvæ of the original worm die in\r\nthe circulation or elsewhere, _e.g._, kidney, but we have no evidence\r\nas to the duration of life of larvæ in the human body; but also it\r\nassumes that a person cannot be reinfected with filaria, for otherwise\r\nthere is no reason why the diseased should not be infected in the same\r\nproportion as the non-diseased. But assuming the explanation to be\r\ntrue, it would explain why a diseased population show larvæ in only\r\nabout one-third of the cases. It must be borne in mind also that the\r\nfigures are rather small.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._--In order to explain the effects which do or may be\r\nexpected to occur from obstruction of lymphatics, it is necessary to\r\nhave an accurate knowledge of the distribution and connections of\r\nlymphatic vessels (and glands) and the anastomoses of these vessels. We\r\ncan only briefly summarize our knowledge here.\r\n\r\nWe should recall also that considerable destruction or obstruction\r\nof lymphatics or glands may occur without necessarily producing any\r\nlymphatic obstruction, at least, of a permanent nature, _e.g._, when\r\na mass of lymphatic glands is destroyed by a bubo in the groin or,\r\nagain, when a carcinomatous mass of glands is removed from the axilla.\r\nAgain, to take the case of chyluria--where it is generally assumed\r\nthat obstruction must occur higher up than the point at which the\r\nintestinal lacteals enter the juxta-aortic glands--this disease may\r\noccur, _e.g._, in temperate regions, quite apart from such obstruction.\r\nIt is true that some of these cases of chyluria are not cases of chyle\r\nin the urine, but, as little or no fat is present, lymphuria. These do\r\nnot require the above assumption, but seeing that true chyluria may\r\napparently occur without such obstruction, we should be cautious about\r\nexplaining this and other symptoms on the basis of obstructions which\r\ntheory may demand, for only too often there are no _post-mortem_ facts\r\nat our disposal.\r\n\r\nLymphangitis: What this is due to is unknown. There is no actual\r\nevidence of the occurrence of adults in the inflamed vessel. Complete\r\ndisappearance, not to reappear, of (non-periodic) mikrofilariæ from the\r\nblood has been shown by Bahr and others to occur within twenty-four\r\nhours after an attack of lymphangitis, orchitis adenitis or simply a\r\nhigh temperature. This mysterious phenomenon requires explanation. If\r\nthe mikrofilariæ were being killed by the attack, their dead bodies\r\nshould still be found in the blood; or if the adults were being killed,\r\nfor all we know to the contrary, the larvæ might well survive. We\r\nconsider there is no evidence that either are affected, but that for\r\nsome reason, as little understood as in periodicity, the larvæ now\r\nremain in the organs.\r\n\r\nAbscess: In Fiji, by Bahr, they have been found in the substance\r\nof various muscles, _e.g._, quadriceps extensor, latissimus dorsi,\r\nserratus magnus, in the popliteal space, groin, axilla, and over the\r\ninternal condyle of the humerus, and in the upper extremity they are\r\nfrequently infected with cocci. They not infrequently contain fragments\r\nof dead adult filariæ. Their mode of origin is not clear. They form\r\nnearly 30 per cent. of cases of filariasis in Fiji. Of 95 cases, 41\r\nshowed mikrofilariæ in blood, 54 did not.\r\n\r\nHydrocele and enlarged testis: In Fiji they form about 10 per cent.\r\n(36 out of 343) of cases of filariasis. The fluid is usually sterile;\r\nmikrofilariæ were present in the fluid in 1 out of 11 cases. In\r\nthe wall numerous calcified adult filariæ may be found. The walls\r\nconsist chiefly of hypertrophied muscle with fibrous tissue, dilated\r\nblood-vessels and lymphatics, the lining epithelium of which appears to\r\nbe absent; of 38 cases 14 had mikrofilariæ in the blood, 24 had not.\r\nMost of the cases are associated with elephantiasis of the scrotum (11\r\nout of 12 cases).\r\n\r\nEnlarged glands form over 40 per cent. (153 out of 343) of cases of\r\nfilariasis, so that they are the commonest expression of filariasis\r\nmet with in Fiji. The glands are enlarged, fibrotic, and the trabeculæ\r\nare thickened. The lymphatics are thickened or represented merely by\r\nfibrous tissue. The gland also shows dilated blood-vessels and numerous\r\nspaces filled with lymph. Giant-cells are common in those glands\r\nwhich contain remnants of filariæ. Masses of lymphocytes enclosed by\r\ninflammatory or fibrous tissue are common. Eosinophile cells are also\r\nextremely common, not only in the fibrous tissue of the glands, but\r\nin other inflammatory or fibrotic conditions: in other organs living\r\nor calcified filariæ are “usually” present. Only about 33 per cent.\r\nshow mikrofilariæ in the blood. The epitrochlear gland is frequently\r\nenlarged in Fiji.\r\n\r\nBreinl has examined enlarged glands and finds loose vascular fibrous\r\ntissue with lymphocytic invasion. In parts, the lymphocytes collect\r\ninto areas 200 µ to 800 µ in diameter. The lymph tissue surrounding the\r\nspermatic cord showed abundance of vessels--(1) large, (2) small. The\r\nlarge had thick walls and wide lumina. In other cases the lumina were\r\nnearly filled by a thrombus of newly formed, fine, loose connective\r\ntissue.\r\n\r\nVaricose glands: In about 7 per cent. (24 out of 343 cases) of\r\nfilariasis, mikrofilariæ are found in the blood in 50 per cent. (12 out\r\nof 24).\r\n\r\n_Elephantiasis._--Elephantiasis scroti is associated with hydrocele\r\nin 50 per cent. of cases (12 out of 23); in 65 per cent. of cases (15\r\nout of 23) there are associated enlarged glands in one or both groins,\r\nthough also hydrocele and enlarged glands occur without elephantiasis\r\nscroti. In 13 out of 27, _i.e._, about 50 per cent., cases of\r\nelephantiasis in various regions, no associated enlargement of glands\r\nis found. Elephantiasis forms in Fiji less than 10 per cent. of cases\r\nof filariasis. Mikrofilariæ are present in the blood in 36 per cent.\r\n(12 out of 33) of cases.\r\n\r\n_Chyluria._--Exceedingly rare in Fiji. Theory would demand an\r\nobstruction above the point of entry of the lacteals, _viz._, the\r\npre-aortic lymphatic glands, but in cases in temperate regions it\r\nmay occur without any such lesion. In some of these cases the fluid\r\nis not chyle (fat absent), but presumably lymph. A discussion of the\r\nmode of production of chyluria, lymph scrotum, elephantiasis, etc.,\r\nis at present premature; theory has far outrun fact. Too much stress\r\nhad been laid on the mechanical action of the worms to the almost\r\ntotal exclusion of their (or possibly their larval) toxic action. The\r\nabove analysis has been made in the hope of acquiring more extended\r\nobservations similar to those made by Bahr.\r\n\r\n_Geographical Distribution._--_Filaria bancrofti_ is known in nearly\r\nall tropical countries. It occurs in India, China, Indo-China, Japan,\r\nAustralia, Queensland, the Islands of Polynesia (with the exception of\r\nthe Sandwich Islands), Egypt, Algeria, Tunis, Madagascar, Zanzibar,\r\nSudan, etc., the south of the United States of America, Brazil,\r\nthe Antilles, etc. Whether it is the same species in all cases is\r\nquestionable.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Filaria demarquayi*, Manson, 1895.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _F. ozzardi_, Manson, 1897.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 284.--_F. demarquayi_: tail, showing paired large\r\nfleshy papillæ. (After Leiper.)]\r\n\r\nThe adult female _F. demarquayi_ measures from 65 to 80 mm. in length\r\nby 0·21 to 0·25 mm. in breadth. The head has a diameter of from 0·09\r\nto 0·1 mm. The mouth is terminal. The genital pore opens at 0·76 mm.\r\nfrom the head. The alimentary canal is nearly straight and terminates\r\nin an anus, which is subterminal. The opening of the anus is marked by\r\na slight papilla. The tail is curved. It rapidly diminishes in size\r\njust below the anal papilla. A characteristic pair of fleshy papillæ\r\nproject from the tip of the tail. The diameter near the tip of the tail\r\nbefore its termination is 0·03 mm. _F. demarquayi_ is a thicker worm\r\nthan _Ac. perstans_. It differs from _F. bancrofti_ in the greater size\r\nof the head, in the smaller tail, and particularly in the marked fleshy\r\npapillæ at the tip of the tail. These papillæ are knobby, and not\r\nsimply cuticular as in _Ac. perstans_.\r\n\r\nThe male of _Filaria demarquayi_ has still to be found.\r\n\r\nThe adult female form of _F. demarquayi_ was found by Dr. Galgey in the\r\nbody of a native of St. Lucia in whose blood the larvæ had been found\r\nduring life. Five adult females were found in the connective tissue of\r\nthe mesentery.\r\n\r\nThe larva measures 200 µ in length by 5 µ in breadth; it is\r\nsharp-tailed, and has no sheath. Its movements are very active, and\r\nthe absence of a sheath enables it to glide along freely all over the\r\nslide. It observes no periodicity, being present in the peripheral\r\ncirculation both by day and by night. As a rule, some eight or ten\r\nparasites are found in an ordinary preparation. Sometimes hundreds of\r\nthese larval filariæ may be counted on every slide.\r\n\r\nThe intermediate host has not been discovered.\r\n\r\n_Geographical Distribution._--St. Vincent, Dominica, Trinidad, and St.\r\nLucia (West Indies), British Guiana, New Guinea (?).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 285.--_Mf. demarquayi_ in thick film, dried and\r\nstained with hæmatoxylin. 6, unshrunken; 7, shrunken. × 1,000.

It measures 16 to 20 cm.\r\nin length and 0·5 mm. in breadth, and is of a whitish or brownish\r\ntint. The cuticle is striated with fine transverse and more marked\r\nlongitudinal striæ with the exception of a small field surrounding\r\nthe mouth, which is terminal and has neither papillæ nor lips. The\r\nœsophagus measures 0·6 mm. in length. The anus is 3 mm. in front of the\r\nrounded posterior extremity, and behind it there are two (glandular?)\r\nsacs. The vulva is close behind the oral aperture; the vagina soon\r\ndivides into two convoluted uteri, which are filled with eggs and\r\nembryos. Embryos 350 µ by 5·5 µ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 286.--_Filaria_ (?) _conjunctivæ_: to the left,\r\nlife size; to the right, the anterior extremity magnified. (After\r\nAddario.)]\r\n\r\n  This species (115 mm. long) was first observed in Milan by Dubini\r\n  in the eye of a man; subsequently it was observed, encysted and\r\n  calcified (190 mm. long), by Babes in the gastro-splenic omentum of\r\n  a woman in Budapest, and finally one (95 mm. long) was extracted by\r\n  Vadela from a tumour the size of a pea in the ocular conjunctiva of a\r\n  woman in Catania (Sicily), which case has been described by Addario.\r\n  Possibly _Agamofilaria palpebralis_, Pace, 1867 (_nec_ Wilson, 1844),\r\n  and _A. oculi humani_, v.

Nordmann, 1832.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Filaria lentis_, Diesing, 1851.\r\n\r\nThe sexless Nematodes observed in the lens of the human eye were\r\ntermed _Filaria oculi humani_. Only three cases are known. v. Nordmann\r\nobserved very small round worms in the lens of a man and woman with\r\ncataract, and Gescheidt once found three specimens in the lens of a\r\nwoman similarly affected.\r\n\r\nThe demonstration of nematode-like formations in the vitreous remains\r\nuncertain even when movements are observed, and when they cannot be\r\nextracted and examined microscopically the doubt may occur that one may\r\nhave mistaken the remains of the hyaloid artery for a worm, which it\r\nresembles in form, size and colour; the slightest movement of the eye\r\nalso causes it to move so that it simulates a living organism.\r\n\r\n  Accordingly it would be more correct to exclude all the cases known\r\n  only ophthalmoscopically (Quadri, 1857; Fano, 1868; Schoeler, 1875;\r\n  Eversbusch, 1891). There then remains only one positive case,\r\n  described by Kühnt in 1891. In this case it was possible to follow\r\n  the gradual growth of the parasite for some time, and the worm, which\r\n  measured only 0·38 mm. in length, was finally extracted.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Agamofilaria labialis*, Pane, 1864.\r\n\r\nThe parasite measures 30 mm. in length; the anterior extremity is\r\npointed; the terminal oral aperture is surrounded by four papillæ; the\r\nanus opens 0·5 mm. in front of the posterior extremity; the vulva is\r\n2·5 mm. in front of the anus; the uterus is double; the anterior one\r\npasses with convolutions forward to the cephalic end; the posterior one\r\nis directed backwards and remains rudimentary.\r\n\r\n  Extracted from a small pustule on the inner surface of the upper lip.\r\n  Also found in Naples by Pierantoni in 1908.\r\n\r\nThe position of many of these worms is doubtful, and still more so is\r\nthat of many other imperfectly described “Filariæ,” which are hardly\r\nmore than useless and confusing names. These include the following:--\r\n\r\n\r\n*Filaria (?) romanorum-orientalis*, Sarcani, 1888.\r\n\r\nObserved in the blood of a Roumanian woman; 1 mm. in length, 0·03 mm.\r\nin breadth; tail end pointed, a tongue-like appendage on the head.

Moreover, Kolb classifies\r\ntogether Nematodes that probably have no connection with each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Filaria (?) sp.?*\r\n\r\nCholodkowsky calls attention to Filariæ that are still unknown which\r\ncause tumours resembling whitlows on the fingers of peasants of the\r\nTwer Government.\r\n\r\n_Mikrofilaria powelli_, Penel, 1905.

The statement that it also\r\n  occurs in the subcutaneous connective tissue is probably due to\r\n  confusion with _Setaria_ (_Filaria_) _hæmorrhagica_, Raill., 1885\r\n  (_Filaria multipapillosa_, Cond. et Drouilly, 1878). _Setaria labiata\r\n  papillosa_ (immature form) occurs in the eye of the horse, adults in\r\n  the peritoneal cavity.\r\n\r\nTreutler, in 1790, found a filaria in the enlarged bronchial lymphatic\r\ngland of a patient suffering from phthisis. It measured 26 mm.\r\nin length and had two spicules, which Treutler mistook for mouth\r\nhooks, hence the name _Hamularia_. Blanchard mentions another case\r\nfrom Geneva, Brera a third and v. Linstow a fourth. As shown by the\r\nsynonyms, a few authors consider this form to be a distinct species,\r\nwhich is hardly probable.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Loa*, Stiles, 1905.\r\n\r\nCharacterized by the possession of cuticular bosses in both sexes\r\n(fig. 294).\r\n\r\n\r\n*Loa loa*, Guyot, 1778.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Filaria oculi_, Gerv. et v. Ben., 1859; _Dracunculus\r\n  oculi_, Diesing, 1860; _Dracunculus loa_, Cobbold, 1864; _Filaria\r\n  subconjunctivalis_, Guyon, 1864.\r\n\r\nThe male measures 25 to 35 mm. in length, and 0·3 to 0·4 mm. in\r\nbreadth; the cuticle is not striated, but, with the exception of the\r\nanterior and posterior extremities (1·5 mm.), is beset with numerous\r\nirregularly distributed bosses (4 µ to 12 µ high by 12 µ to 27 µ\r\nbroad). The anterior extremity is somewhat attenuated, and in front\r\nis conical and transversely truncated. At the anterior limit of the\r\nconical part is a small papilla corresponding with the dorsal and\r\nventral median lines, and a little in front six non-projecting sensory\r\npapillæ (two lateral, four sub-median). Excretory pore 0·65 mm. from\r\nthe anterior end. The posterior extremity is attenuated and somewhat\r\ncurved ventrally; the anus is 0·082 mm. distant from the rounded\r\nposterior border. In front of the anus on each side are three globular\r\nand pedunculated papillæ of different sizes, set close one behind\r\nthe other but asymmetrically; behind the anus on either side are two\r\nsmaller papillæ of a different shape; the anterior one resembles the\r\npre-anal papillæ in form, but is smaller; the posterior one is conical,\r\nand rests with a broad base on the cuticle. The spicules are 0·113 and\r\n0·176 mm. long.\r\n\r\nThe female measures 45 to 63 mm. in length by 0·5 mm. in breadth. It\r\nis also beset with irregularly distributed bosses, which in places lie\r\nclose to each other, and extend to the anterior extremity; posteriorly\r\nthey become less frequent, but are not entirely absent. The anterior\r\nextremity is conical, the posterior one straight, attenuated, rounded\r\noff, 0·17 mm. from the anus. The uteri contain eggs in the most various\r\nstages of development, as well as hatched-out larvæ, 253 µ to 262 µ\r\nin length and 4·7 µ to 5 µ in breadth. The vulva lies about 2 mm.\r\nfrom the head end. The vagina, 9 mm. long, divides into two branches,\r\nwhich at first run posteriorly and parallel to one another for about\r\n18 mm. One then bends forward, runs as far as the œsophagus, bends here\r\nagain and runs backward to end at the point of its first bending. The\r\nother branch at first runs straight backward and then bends forward,\r\nbut before reaching the point of the first bend of the anterior tube\r\nbends backward again, forms again a loop and ends at the level of the\r\nanus. The tubes consist in the main of the uterus, then a club-shaped\r\nswelling, the receptaculum seminis, then the oviduct 2 mm. long, and\r\nfinally the ovary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 290.--_Loa loa_: the anterior end of the male,\r\nmagnified.

The vitelline “shell”\r\nof the egg is, according to most authors, stretched by the embryo and\r\nbecomes the sheath of the hatched larva.

(After Leiper.)]\r\n\r\n_Site of Worms._--In various localities; under the muscular aponeuroses\r\non extensor surfaces of arms and legs, fingers, trunk, eyelid,\r\nconjunctiva, frænum linguæ, penis, pericardium, anterior chamber of\r\neye, and, according to some authorities, in lymphatic vessels, _e.g._,\r\nthose of spermatic cord. As many as thirty adults may be found. The\r\nworms appear to be frequently immature, and it has been stated that\r\nworms in superficial parts are immature, those situated deeply are\r\nmature, but the data are few.\r\n\r\n  The first accounts of _Loa loa_--long since forgotten--were reported\r\n  by Pigafetta, and are contained in a book of travels on the Congo\r\n  printed in 1598. In an accompanying illustration is depicted, not\r\n  only the ancient method of extraction of the Medina worm, but\r\n  also the operative removal of the filaria from the conjunctiva.\r\n  Subsequently the presence of the worm in negroes was confirmed by\r\n  Bajon in Guiana (1768) and by Mongin in Mariborou (San Domingo),\r\n  likewise in a negro (1770). At about this time a French ship’s\r\n  doctor, Guyot, was cruising on the West Coast of Africa; he observed\r\n  the parasite termed “loa” by the natives, and learned that it was\r\n  frequent in the negroes of the Congo district. Since that time\r\n  numerous observations have been reported. It was formerly common in\r\n  South America, where the parasite was imported by slaves, but it\r\n  disappeared when the traffic ceased; it was particularly prevalent\r\n  in the Congo, where it occurs not only in natives, but also in\r\n  Europeans. During recent times it has repeatedly been observed in\r\n  Europe in negroes as well as in white men who have lived on the West\r\n  Coast of Africa.\r\n\r\nNematodes of different size have been repeatedly observed in the eye of\r\nman, in the anterior chamber, lens and vitreous. For example, Mercier,\r\nin 1771 and 1774, removed a filaria out of the anterior chamber of two\r\nnegroes in St. Domingo. One was 36 mm. long. Barkan, in 1876, in San\r\nFrancisco, removed one from the eye of an Australian. Again, Cappez\r\nand Lacompte, in Brussels, in 1894, observed for some weeks immature\r\nNematodes in the eye of a negro girl, aged 2-1/2 years, and then\r\nremoved them. What these Nematodes actually were in these cases it is\r\nimpossible to say.\r\n\r\n_Structure of Larvæ._--In dried films the larva varies in size from\r\n140·5 µ to 166·5 µ, average, 152·5 µ; while another set of measurements\r\ngave the values 131 µ, to 150 µ, average, 143·6. In films fixed with\r\nhot alcohol the dimensions were 208 µ to 254 µ, average, 231 µ.\r\n\r\nThe nerve ring 21·4 to 21·8 per cent. Excretory pore 30·4 to 31·8 per\r\ncent. Excretory cell 34·8 to 37·3 per cent. G1 cell 68·2 to 68·5 per\r\ncent. Anal pore 81·6 to 82·4 per cent. of total length. For other\r\ndetails _cf._ _Filaria bancrofti_.\r\n\r\n_Larvæ in Blood._--These from their diurnal periodicity are known as\r\n_Mikrofilaria diurna_. The evidence that these larvæ are the young\r\nof the adult worm _Loa loa_ is: (1) They are identical in structure\r\nwith larvæ taken from the uterus of _L. loa_; (2) their geographical\r\ndistribution is the same as that of _L. loa_; (3) they eventually occur\r\nin the blood of patients suffering from Calabar swellings, a condition\r\ndue to _L. loa_. Their occurrence in the blood in this latter condition\r\nand in _L. loa_ infections we shall consider later.\r\n\r\n_Periodicity._--Here, as in the case of the larvæ of _Filaria\r\nbancrofti_, the larvæ that appear in the blood are probably the\r\noverflow simply of the larvæ which we assume, on analogy, to have\r\ntheir principal site in the lungs. They appear in the blood about the\r\ntime of getting up, 6 to 8 a.m. (10 in 20 mm.^3), at 12 noon there\r\nare twenty-four, at 8 p.m. the number has fallen to eighteen, and at\r\nmidnight to one, while from 2 a.m. to 6 a.m. none, or one only, may be\r\nfound. This periodicity is, as a rule, a very constant one, but there\r\nare exceptions, and in certain cases more have been found at midnight\r\nthan at 9 a.m. The periodicity is also lost in pathological conditions,\r\n_e.g._, sleeping sickness (_vide_ also under _Filaria bancrofti_). The\r\npossibility of non-periodic _Loa loa_ larvæ should also be considered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 297.--_Mf. loa_: in thick film, dried and stained\r\nwith hæmatoxylin. × 1,000. (After Fülleborn.)]\r\n\r\n_Pathology._--The parasite wanders about the body, and may be seen\r\nunder the skin in thin parts. Their advance is in some cases at the\r\nrate of an inch in two minutes. During their progress they give rise\r\nto creeping sensations and to a condition of transient œdematous areas\r\nknown as Calabar swellings on various parts of the body, _e.g._, arm.\r\nThese vary in diameter from 1 to 10 cm., and often shift their position\r\nan inch or so a day. They give rise to a certain amount of redness,\r\ntension and heat, and their development is promoted by muscular action\r\nof the part. They disappear to reappear elsewhere. The condition is\r\nassociated with a high eosinophilia, 50 per cent. being not uncommon.\r\nPatients known to harbour _L. loa_, _e.g._, native children,\r\nfrequently show no larvæ in their blood, but they may do so after years\r\nof infection. Again, in patients having an infection of _Mikrofilaria\r\ndiurna_, there is frequently at the time no evidence of the presence of\r\n_Loa loa_ adults. Here again they may appear later, but the conditions\r\nwhich determine whether persons infected with _L. loa_ show larvæ in\r\nthe blood, or persons infected with _Mikrofilaria diurna_ also show _L.\r\nloa_, are unknown, though explanations unsupported by facts abound.\r\nLikewise also the mode of production of the swellings is unknown.\r\n\r\nNot uncommonly _Mikrofilaria perstans_ occurs in the blood together\r\nwith _M. diurna_.\r\n\r\n_Duration of Life._--This is long, as some cases have been observed\r\nfive to six years after leaving Africa. The incubation period is about\r\na year.\r\n\r\n_Life-history._--Development of the larvæ takes place in the salivary\r\nglands of Chrysops sp. as shown by Leiper.\r\n\r\n_Geographical Distribution._-- West Africa, especially in Congo.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Acanthocheilonema*, Cobbold, 1870.\r\n\r\nCuticle striated _longitudinally_.

There\r\nare four pairs of pre-anal papillæ and two pairs of post-anal papillæ.\r\nSpicules very unequal in size. Cloaca 121 µ from the tail end. At the\r\ntail end two triangular cuticular appendages.\r\n\r\nThe adult worms inhabit the connective tissue at the base of the\r\nmesentery, especially in the region of the pancreas, abdominal aorta\r\nand suprarenals. To find them the mesentery should be removed, placed\r\nin a 2 per cent. solution of formalin, and then carefully examined at\r\nleisure.\r\n\r\n_Mikrofilaria perstans._--160 µ to 210 µ by 5 µ to 6 µ broad.

Absent from\r\nZululand, Basutoland. On the East Coast of Africa it is not found in\r\nthe towns of Zanzibar and Mombasa, neither is it found in the country\r\nof the Masi, nor amongst the Kavirondo, who dwell along the north-east\r\nshores of Lake Victoria.\r\n\r\nIn South America, _Ac. perstans_ is very common amongst the aboriginal\r\nIndians in the interior of British Guiana. However, it is not found in\r\nGeorgetown and in New Amsterdam, neither is it found in the cultivated\r\nstrip of coast lying between these two towns, but it is common on the\r\ncoast farther north near the Venezuelan boundary, where the forests\r\nstretch to the sea. The Waran Indians, who live at the mouth of the\r\nWaini river, harbour this parasite. It is absent in the West Indies.\r\n\r\nTopographically, _Ac. perstans_ is found only in areas covered by\r\ndense forest growth and abounding in swamps. In Kavirondo, where the\r\nforest disappears and the land is covered with scrub and short grass,\r\nit is not found; likewise it is not found on the grassy plains of the\r\nhighlands of British East Africa. Towns and cultivated areas are free\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Dirofilaria.* Railliet and Henry, 1911.\r\n\r\nBody very long, thread-like, cuticle transversely striated. Mouth\r\nwith six papillæ. Male tail spiral with voluminous pre-anal and some\r\nlarge post-anal papillæ; spicules unequal. Vulva near the anterior\r\nhundredth of body; viviparous. Parasitic in heart or blood-vessels and\r\nsubcutaneous tissue.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Dirofilaria magalhãesi*, R. Blanchard, 1895.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Filaria bancrofti_, v. Linstow, 1892; _Filaria bancrofti_,\r\n  P. S. de Magalhães, 1892 (_nec_ Cobbold, 1877).\r\n\r\nThe male measures 83 mm. in length by 0·28 to 0·40 mm. in breadth.\r\nThe anterior extremity is rounded, and has no papillæ (?6); the\r\nposterior extremity exhibits a double curve, with four pre-anal\r\nand four post-anal papillæ on each side. These are large and have\r\na villous appearance. The mouth is round and unarmed, the pharynx\r\nmeasures 1 mm. in length, is cylindrical, very muscular, and its hinder\r\npart is dilated. The anus is situated 0·11 mm. in front of the hind\r\nend. There are probably two unequal spicules; one only, however, is\r\nknown--apparently the shorter one--the length of which is given as 0·17\r\nto 0·23 mm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 300.--_Dirofilaria magalhãesi_: posterior\r\nextremity. (After v.

Figueira de Saboia in Rio de Janeiro, and has\r\n  been described by P. S. de Magalhães.\r\n\r\n  _D. immitis_ occurs in the right ventricle of the heart of the dog in\r\n  Europe and the Tropics.\r\n\r\n  _D. repens_ is also a common subcutaneous Nematode in dogs in Annam.\r\n\r\n\r\nSub-family. *Onchocercinæ*, Leiper, 1911.\r\n\r\nCuticle with spiral thickenings.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Onchocerca*, Diesing, 1841.\r\n\r\nMale with four pre-anal papillæ. Female with vulva situated anteriorly.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Onchocerca volvulus*, R. Leuckart, 1893.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Filaria volvulus_, R. Leuckart, 1893.\r\n\r\nThe adult male measures 30 to 35 mm. in length by 0·14 mm. in breadth.\r\nThe body is white, filiform, attenuated at both ends. The head is\r\nrounded and has a diameter of 0·048 mm. The cuticle is distinctly\r\ntransversely striated. The mouth is unarmed. The alimentary canal is\r\nstraight, the anus opening 0·07 mm. from the tip of the tail. The tail\r\nis strongly curved and somewhat flattened on the concave surface. There\r\nare three papillæ, one large and two small, on each side of the cloaca\r\nand one large and two post-anal small papillæ. Two curved spicules,\r\n0·166 and 0·08 mm. respectively.\r\n\r\nThe adult female is of uncertain length, but much longer than the\r\nmale, probably about 10 to 12 cm. The head is rounded and truncated;\r\nit measures 0·065 mm. in diameter. The tail is curved. The vulva opens\r\n0·55 mm. from the head. The hand-like cuticular thickenings are well\r\nmarked. Eggs ovoid with a prolongation at each pole “like an orange\r\nwrapped in tissue paper.” The larva measures about 300 µ by 7 µ to 8 µ;\r\nit has no “sheath.” The body tapers from about the last fifth of its\r\nlength, and terminates in a sharply pointed tail. At about the anterior\r\nfifth of the body there is a *V* spot.\r\n\r\n_O. volvulus_ is found in peculiar subcutaneous tumours, the size of\r\na pea to that of a pigeon’s egg. The same patient may present one or\r\nseveral of these tumours. The regions of the body most frequently\r\naffected are those in which the peripheral lymphatics converge. Thus\r\nthey are usually found in the axilla, in the popliteal space, about the\r\nelbow, in the sub-occipital region and in the intercostal spaces. The\r\ntumours are never adherent to the surrounding structures, and can be\r\neasily enucleated. They are formed of a dense connective tissue wall\r\nand internally a looser fibrous meshwork. This is traversed by a series\r\nof canals in which the worms lie, but they are also partly embedded\r\nin the denser wall. The canals apparently dilate into cavities filled\r\nwith slimy pus-like fluid consisting largely of larvæ. According to\r\nBrumpt the posterior extremity of the male, and the anterior extremity\r\nof the female with its vaginal opening, are free in one of the spaces\r\nfor the purpose of copulation and parturition. If a tumour be cut into\r\nand placed in salt solution, Rodenwaldt states that the undamaged males\r\nwander out into the solution.\r\n\r\nThe formation of the tumours is elucidated by Labadie-Lagrave and\r\nDeguy’s case. The authors found an immature female _Onchocerca\r\nvolvulus_ in a lymphatic vessel partly obstructed by an infiltration\r\nof fibrin and leucocytes. It appears, therefore, that the presence\r\nof the parasites within the lymphatics gives rise to an inflammatory\r\nprocess, and that the consequent fibrinous deposit envelops the\r\nparasites, obliterates the lumen of the vessel, and ultimately isolates\r\nthe affected tract. At any rate, in young tumours the worms appear\r\nto lie in a structureless substance permeated by leucocytes in which\r\nconnective tissue is gradually organized from the periphery, thus\r\nisolating the worms.\r\n\r\nIn cases of infection with _O. volvulus_ larvæ have been found by\r\nOuizilleau, Fülleborn, and Simon in lymph glands, and in the finger\r\nblood if considerable pressure is used so as to squeeze lymph out\r\nof the tissues. They are _sheathless_, and the following are the\r\ndimensions in ordinary dried films: Length, 274 µ; nerve ring, 23·7\r\nper cent.; G1 cell, 69·6 per cent.; end of last tail cell, 96·3 per\r\ncent. The dimensions of larvæ of _O. volvulus_ taken from the uterus\r\nand prepared in the same way are: Length, 224·5 µ; nerve ring, 24·3 per\r\ncent.; G1 cell, 68·9 per cent.; end of the last tail cell, 95·5 per\r\ncent. In all probability the larvæ in the glands and blood are those of\r\n_O. volvulus_.\r\n\r\nAccording to the natives, the tumours may last indefinitely and never\r\nulcerate. Some old patients told Brumpt that their tumours had been\r\npresent since childhood. Probably _Onchocerca volvulus_, like some\r\nother _Filariidæ_, may live for many years.\r\n\r\n_O. volvulus_ occurs in various parts of West Africa: Gold Coast,\r\nSierra Leone, Dahomey, Lagos, Cameroons. Brumpt, on the banks of the\r\nWelle between Dongon and M’Binia (Belgian Congo), found about 5 per\r\ncent. of the riverine population affected.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Trichinellidæ*, Stiles and Crane, 1910.\r\n\r\nSub-family. *Trichurinæ*, Ransom, 1911.\r\n\r\nMale with a single long spicule, with sleeve-like sheath.

The female measures 45\r\nto 50 mm. in length, of which two-fifths appertain to the posterior\r\npart of the body. The ova are barrel-shaped and have a thick brownish\r\nshell which is perforated at the poles. Each opening is closed by\r\na light-coloured plug. The eggs measure 50 µ to 54 µ in length and\r\n23 µ in breadth; they are deposited before segmentation. _Trichuris\r\ntrichiura_ usually lives in the cæcum of man, and is also occasionally\r\nfound in the vermiform appendix and in the colon, exceptionally also\r\nin the small intestine; usually only a few specimens are present, and\r\nthese do not cause any particular disturbance, although, as Askanazy\r\nfound, they feed on blood; in other cases cerebral symptoms of more\r\nor less severity are observed when Trichocephali are present in large\r\nnumbers. At _post-mortems_ performed soon after death the filiform\r\nanterior extremity of the worm is frequently found embedded in the\r\nmucous membrane (Askanazy).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 301.--_Trichuris trichiura_: on the left, male; on\r\nthe right, female with the anterior extremity embedded in the mucous\r\nmembrane of the intestine; below, egg.]\r\n\r\n  The whip worm is one of the most common parasites of man and\r\n  appears to be distributed over the entire surface of the globe; it\r\n  is, however, more frequent in the warmer regions. It is found in\r\n  persons of both sexes and all ages with the exception of infants. In\r\n  autopsies it is found in the following numbers: In Dresden in 2·5 per\r\n  cent., in Erlangen in 11·1 per cent., in Kiel in 31·8 per cent., in\r\n  Munich in 9·3 per cent., in Petrograd in 0·18 per cent., in Göttingen\r\n  in 46·1 per cent., in Basle in 23·7 per cent., in Greenwich in 68 per\r\n  cent., in Dublin in 89 per cent., in Paris in about 50 per cent.,\r\n  and in Southern Italy in almost 100 per cent. On examining the fæces\r\n  the eggs of the whip worm were found as follows: In Munich in 8·26\r\n  per cent., in Kiel in 45·2 per cent., in Greifswald in 45 per cent.,\r\n  in North Holland in 7 per cent., in Novgorod in 26·4 per cent., in\r\n  Petrograd in 5 per cent., in Moscow in 5·3 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe development of the eggs is completed in water or in moist soil,\r\nand occupies a longer or shorter time according to the season; the\r\neggs possess great powers of resistance, as do the larvæ, which,\r\naccording to Davaine, may remain as long as five years in the eggshell\r\nwithout losing their vitality. Leuckart proved by experiment that\r\ndirect infection with _Trichuris ovis_ (_Ovis aries_) and _T. crenata_\r\n(_Sus scrofa dom._) was produced by embryo-containing eggs; Railliet\r\nobtained the same results with _T. depressiuscula_ of dogs, and Grassi\r\nsubsequently, by means of two experiments, demonstrated the direct\r\ndevelopment of _Trichuris trichiura_. In one case embryo-containing\r\neggs were swallowed on June 27, 1884, and on July 24 the ova of\r\nTrichocephali were found in the fæces for the first time.\r\n\r\n_Trichuris trichiura_ is found not only in man, but also in various\r\nmonkeys (_T. palæformis_, Rud.), as well as in lemurs (_T. lemuris_,\r\nRud.).\r\n\r\nOther species are _T. crenata_ in pig; _T. ovis_ in cattle, sheep,\r\ngoat, and pig (?); _T. depressiuscula_ in dog; _T. campanula_ in\r\ncat; _T. unguiculata_ in rabbit and hare; _T. cameli_ in camel; _T.\r\ndiscolor_ in humped cattle; _T. nodosus_ in mouse; _T. alcocki_ in the\r\nthamin (India); _T. globulosa_ in camel; _T. giraffæ_ in giraffe.\r\n\r\n\r\nSub-family. *Trichinellinæ*, Ransom, 1911.\r\n\r\nMale without spicule; females ovoviviparous. Larvæ penetrate muscles of\r\nhost and become encysted. Genus: Trichinella.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Trichinella*, Railliet, 1895.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Trichina_, Owen, 1835 (_nec_ Meigen, 1830).\r\n\r\n  Very small _Trichinellinæ_, the males of which have two conical\r\n  appendages at the caudal extremity; the vulva is situated at the\r\n  border of the anterior fifth of the body. There is only one species.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Trichinella spiralis*, Owen, 1835.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Trichina spiralis_, Owen, 1835.\r\n\r\nThe male measures 1·4 to 1·6 mm. in length and 0·04 mm. in diameter.\r\nThe anterior part of the body is narrowed, the orifice of the cloaca is\r\nterminal and lies between the two caudal appendages; internal to these\r\nare two pairs of papillæ, dorsal one behind the other. The cloaca is\r\nevertible for copulation. The females measure 3 to 4 mm. in length and\r\n0·06 mm. in diameter; anus terminal.\r\n\r\n_Trichinella spiralis_ in its adult stage inhabits the small intestine\r\nof man, pig, wild boar, rat. The young do not leave the body of the\r\nhost but become encysted in the muscles. Experimentally it develops\r\nin the black rat (_Mus rattus_), the sewer rat (_M. decumanus_), the\r\ndomestic pig (_Sus scrofa dom._), the wild boar (_Sus scrofa ferox_),\r\nthe domestic dog (_Canis familiaris_), the fox (_C. vulpes_) the\r\nbadger (_Meles taxus_), the polecat (_Putorius fœtidus_), the marten\r\n(_Mustela foina_), the raccoon (_Procyon lotor_), the hippopotamus and\r\nthe cat, and many other mammals (rodents and carnivora); Trichinellæ\r\nhave been artificially introduced, by administering the encysted stage,\r\ninto the dog, the mole (_Talpa europæa_), the mouse (_Mus musculus_),\r\nthe hare (_Lepus timidus_), the rabbit (_L. cuniculus_), the hedgehog\r\n(_Erinaceus europæus_), the marmot (_Cricetus vulgaris_), the vole,\r\nthe dormouse, the sheep, the calf, the horse, etc. Human beings and\r\nthe pig, rat, mouse, guinea-pig and rabbit are most easily infected;\r\nless easily the sheep, calf and horse; with difficulty the cat, dog\r\nand badger. Trichinella can also be reared in birds (fowl, pigeon and\r\nduck), but the young do not encyst in the muscular system, but are\r\nexpelled with the fæces. By cold-blooded animals as well as by insects\r\n(_Calliphora vomitaria_), encysted Trichinellæ are evacuated without\r\nundergoing any change, but they will still develop if subsequently\r\ningested, say, by rabbits. According to Gujon, however, Trichinella\r\ncan develop in salamanders, because he has found Trichinella of the\r\nmuscles in these animals after they had been fed on encysted specimens.\r\nA high temperature (30°C.) must be provided in which to keep the\r\nexperimental animals to ensure the success of the infection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 302.--_Trichinella spiralis_. ♀, mature female:\r\n_E_, embryos; _V_, vulva; _Ov_, ovary. ♂, mature male: _T_, testes.\r\n_c._, newly born larva. _d._, larva in the muscles. _e._, encapsuled\r\nlarva in the muscles. Magnified. (After Claus.)]\r\n\r\n  _History._--Encapsuled Trichinellæ had been observed in London by\r\n  Peacock (1828) and by J. Hilton (1833) in the muscular system of man;\r\n  soon after (1835), Paget found them in London in an Italian who had\r\n  died of tuberculosis, and recognized them to be encysted entozoa,\r\n  which R. Owen described as _Trichina spiralis_. Soon after, some\r\n  further observations were reported on the occurrence of encysted\r\n  Trichinellæ, in man, in England, Berlin, Heidelberg, Denmark, North\r\n  America; they were also found in the pig (Leidy, Philadelphia)\r\n  and the cat (Herbst, Göttingen, and Gurlt, Berlin). Herbst even\r\n  succeeded in infecting a badger with encysted Trichinellæ, and\r\n  subsequently infected two dogs with the flesh of this badger (1850).\r\n  In 1855 R. Leuckart (Giessen) also commenced feeding experiments,\r\n  and, like Küchenmeister and Virchow (1859), first went on the wrong\r\n  track because it was believed at that time that Trichinellæ were\r\n  the larvæ either of Trichocephalus or Strongylus. Nevertheless,\r\n  these experiments yielded some important results; they showed that\r\n  Trichinellæ become adult in the intestine within a few days, and that\r\n  the females are viviparous (Leuckart). Until that time Trichinellæ\r\n  had been regarded as fairly harmless guests of man, but opinions\r\n  soon changed when Zenker in Dresden (January, 1860), in performing\r\n  the autopsy of a girl, aged 10, who had entered the hospital with\r\n  typhoid symptoms and there died, found Trichinellæ (not yet encysted)\r\n  in the muscles; the intestinal lesions characteristic of typhoid\r\n  were lacking, but numerous adult Trichinellæ were found in the\r\n  intestine. Inquiries elicited the fact that at about Christmas time\r\n  the girl had been taken ill after eating pork, and at the same time\r\n  the butcher from whom the meat was bought as well as several of his\r\n  customers fell sick: the pickled pieces of the same meat were full\r\n  of Trichinellæ. In the face of this information it was not difficult\r\n  to ascertain the cause of the disease and the manner of infection\r\n  in Zenker’s case, and it was not long before Leuckart, Virchow and\r\n  Zenker were able by renewed experiments to demonstrate the cycle\r\n  of development of _Trichinella spiralis_. Similar investigations\r\n  followed by Claus in Würzburg, Davaine in Paris, Fuchs and\r\n  Pagenstecher in Heidelberg, etc.\r\n\r\n  Hardly had Zenker’s case been published than numerous observations on\r\n  trichinosis in man appeared, some referring to isolated cases, others\r\n  to small or great epidemics, and nearly all from North Germany.\r\n  The worst epidemic was that of Hadersleben (1865), in which place,\r\n  numbering hardly 2,000 inhabitants, 337 persons were taken ill within\r\n  a short time, and of these 101 died. The source of infection proved\r\n  to be a single pig, the flesh of which had been mixed with that of\r\n  three other pigs; 200 of the badly infected persons had exclusively\r\n  eaten raw pork.\r\n\r\n  Moreover, it soon became clear that epidemics of trichinosis had been\r\n  observed in Germany prior to 1860, but that their nature had not been\r\n  recognized, although in a few cases Trichinellæ had been found in the\r\n  muscles of those who had succumbed.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF _Trichinella spiralis_.\r\n\r\nShortly after their introduction into the intestine of experimental\r\nanimals the encysted Trichinellæ escape from their capsules, which are\r\ndestroyed by the gastric juices, and they then enter the duodenum and\r\njejunum, where they become adult. During this period they do not grow\r\nmuch, the males from 0·8 to 1·0 to 1·2 to 1·5 mm.; the females to 1·5\r\nto 1·8 mm. Soon after copulation, which takes place in the course of\r\ntwo days, the males die; the females, which during the following days\r\nattain a length of 3 to 3·5 mm., either bore more or less deeply into\r\nthe villi or, by means of Lieberkühn’s glands, into the mucous membrane\r\n(Askanazy, Cerfontaine, Geisse), and thus usually attain the lymph\r\nspaces. A few also pierce the intestinal wall and are then found in\r\nthe mesentery and glands. The females deposit their young, the number\r\nof which, according to Leuckart, averages at least 1,500, in the lymph\r\nspaces; the newly born larvæ measure 90 µ to 100 µ in length, 6 µ in\r\ndiameter, and they do not appear to increase in size during their\r\nmigrations. The migrations are mostly passive, that is to say, the\r\nlarvæ are carried along mainly by the lymph stream to the heart, but\r\nsometimes they are active, as may be inferred from the fact that young\r\nTrichinellæ are found in various parts of the intestinal wall beyond\r\nthe chyle and lymph spaces, as well as in abundance in the abdominal\r\ncavity. Trichinellæ occur in the heart’s blood of artificially infected\r\nanimals seven to twenty-three days after infection. If scanty, dilute\r\nthe blood with about ten times the amount of 3 per cent. acetic acid\r\nand centrifugalize.\r\n\r\nThe young brood is distributed from the heart throughout the entire\r\nbody, but the conditions necessary to its further development are found\r\nonly in striated muscle; the young Nematodes penetrate the capillaries,\r\nattain the intramuscular connective tissue and then invade the fibres\r\n(Virchow, Leuckart, Graham[304]). On the ninth or tenth day after\r\ninfection the first Trichinellæ have reached their destination; but\r\nfurther invasions are constantly taking place because the intestinal\r\nTrichinellæ live from five to seven weeks, and continue to produce\r\ntheir young.\r\n\r\n[304] Trichinellæ that are unable to penetrate into muscular fibres\r\ninvariably die, no matter where else they settle; their occurrence\r\nin the adipose tissue is disputed, but is still possibly correct, as\r\nbundles of muscles are present in the fat of bacon. The Trichinellæ\r\ndo not settle in heart muscle, although they may reach it in cases of\r\nheavy infection; they then die or wander into the pericardium, and\r\neventually into the heart cavities.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--(1) Period of invasion: Gastro-intestinal\r\nsymptoms--nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhœa, colic. Muscular pains may\r\noccur even at this period. Recurrent abdominal pains about the eighth\r\nday, a _temporary_ œdema. Embryos are abundant in the serous cavities.\r\n\r\n(2) Period of dissemination: Second week. Myositis, variable in amount,\r\nis the predominant symptom. The biceps and calf may be hard and tender.\r\nMastication, speech, respiration, etc., may be difficult and painful.\r\nDyspnœa may be intense. Temperature 104° to 105° F.\r\n\r\n(3) Period of encystment: Symptoms of marked cachexia. Third week:\r\nSecond period of œdema, especially of face. Delirium, somnolence, lung\r\naffections. Death or gradual subsidence of symptoms in mild cases.\r\n\r\nEosinophilia (50 per cent. or more) is present.\r\n\r\n  In consequence of the new batches of young produced during several\r\n  weeks, the above-mentioned symptoms of disease are often considerably\r\n  aggravated; the fever increases, delirium may arise, and infiltration\r\n  of the lungs, fatty degeneration of the liver and inflammation of the\r\n  kidneys may ensue; the initial slight œdema may extend, the strength\r\n  dwindles, and in many cases the patients succumb to the trichinosis.\r\n  In severe cases improvement of the condition is only apt to occur in\r\n  the fourth or fifth week; the convalescence is always protracted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 303.--_A._, isolated muscular fibre of a rat,\r\ninvaded by Trichinella. 510/1. _B._, section through the muscle of a\r\nrat; the infected fibre has lost its transverse striation; its nuclei\r\nare enlarged and multiplied. 310/1. _C._, portion of a Trichinella\r\ncapsule, at the pole of which connective tissue cells are penetrating\r\nthe thickened sarcolemma. (After Hertwig-Graham.)]\r\n\r\nThe muscular fibres attacked degenerate, the transverse striation at\r\nfirst disappearing; the fibres then assume a granular appearance, the\r\nnuclei multiply and become enlarged, and are surrounded by an area\r\nof granular material, which stains more deeply than the remaining\r\ncontents of the sarcolemma. Two or three weeks after infection, the\r\nspirally rolled-up Trichinellæ have grown to 0·8 to 1·0 mm., and in\r\ntheir vicinity the muscular fibre is swollen, spindle-shaped, and the\r\nsarcolemma is glassy and thickened. The inflammation also extends\r\nto contiguous fibres, especially to the intramuscular tissue, which\r\nproliferates greatly, especially in the vicinity of the degenerated\r\nfibres. While the latter become more and more absorbed, the capsule\r\nis formed by the inflamed connective tissue, which, penetrating into\r\nthe glassy and thickened sarcolemma from the poles of the spindle,\r\nforms the cystic membrane. According to other authorities, the larvæ\r\nsettle in the _inter_muscular connective tissue which forms the cyst\r\nand not in the muscular fibres within the sarcolemma. The cysts are\r\nlemon-shaped and usually lie with their longitudinal axis in the\r\ndirection of the muscular fibres; on an average they measure 400 µ in\r\nlength by 250 µ in breadth.\r\n\r\nLater on fat cells appear at their poles, and after about six or nine\r\nmonths they commence to calcify, the process starting at the poles\r\n(fig. 305). Finally, sometimes after the lapse of years, the captive\r\nTrichinellæ themselves become calcified.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 304.--Calcified Trichinella in the muscular system\r\nof a pig; the capsules are not calcified. (After Ostertag.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 305.--Various phases of the calcification of\r\nTrichinella of the muscles, which starts at the poles of the capsule.]\r\n\r\nAccording to experience, Trichinellæ are not evenly distributed in the\r\nmuscular system of pigs; the diaphragm, the muscles of the larynx,\r\ntongue, abdomen and intercostal spaces are their favourite positions;\r\nthis predilection for the respiratory muscles is explained by their\r\nregular contractions, owing to which regular narrowings of the\r\ncapillaries take place, thus favouring the settling of the circulating\r\nTrichinellæ. The same circumstance probably explains the frequency of\r\nthe parasites in the tongue.\r\n\r\nPossibly also the Trichinellæ that bore direct through the intestine\r\nmay, from the abdominal cavity, penetrate the muscles in the vicinity.\r\nFrequently also encysted Trichinellæ are found in remarkable numbers\r\nin the vicinity of the points of insertion of the tendons, this\r\nproclivity being probably connected with the fact that the Trichinellæ\r\nfirst of all wander into the muscular fibres and find a natural barrier\r\nat the points of insertion of the tendons.\r\n\r\nThe Trichinellæ, in their encysted condition, may remain alive and\r\ncapable of development for many years--in the pig eleven years and in\r\nman as much as twenty-five to thirty-one years. Encystment, however,\r\nis not a necessary condition for the development of the brood, that\r\nis to say, Trichinellæ which reach the gut of suitable animals become\r\nsexually mature and multiply provided that they have developed so far\r\nas to possess a rudimentary genital spot, which occurs when the body is\r\n0·5 to 0·75 mm. long, but all the same a great part of non-encapsuled\r\nTrichinæ perish on their passage through the stomach.\r\n\r\nThe black rat (_Mus rattus_), and more particularly the sewer rat (_Mus\r\ndecumanus_[305]), are the normal hosts of _Trichinella spiralis_.\r\nThese animals, especially the last-named species, infect themselves\r\nvery easily, as they are cannibalistic, and they also transmit\r\ntrichinosis to other species by which they are devoured, such as pigs,\r\ndogs, cats, foxes, bears and martens. Rats are infected also by the\r\ningestion of fæcal matter from infected animals which contains trichinæ\r\n(Höyberg). Man becomes infected with Trichinella by eating the flesh,\r\ninsufficiently cooked, of infected pigs, also, but more rarely, by\r\neating the infected flesh of wild boars, dogs, cats, bears and foxes.\r\n\r\n[305] It is still a matter of dispute and can hardly be definitely\r\nsettled whether Trichinellæ were brought to Europe by the sewer rats\r\nwhich invaded Europe at the end of the eighteenth century, or whether\r\nthey were imported with the Chinese pig in 1820 or 1830, when it was\r\nintroduced into England and Germany to cross with the native breeds, or\r\nwhether finally Trichinellæ are also indigenous to Europe.\r\n\r\n  The infection of pigs may likewise take place by their having access\r\n  to the offal of trichinous pigs, or being actually fed on it. These\r\n  are, however, exceptions, which, as a matter of course, are of great\r\n  importance in certain places. As a matter of fact, the rats examined\r\n  for Trichinella were always found to be severely infected. Thus\r\n  Billings, in the knackers’ yard at Boston, found that 76 per cent.\r\n  of the rats were infected, and in an export slaughterhouse 100 per\r\n  cent. were found to harbour the parasite; in the city of Boston 10\r\n  per cent. of the rats had trichinosis. Heller found that of 704 rats,\r\n  from twenty-nine different places in Saxony, Bavaria, Würtemberg and\r\n  Austria, 8·3 per cent. were infected with Trichinellæ; of the rats\r\n  caught in the knackers’ yards, 22·1 were diseased; of those taken in\r\n  slaughterhouses, 2·3 were infected, and of rats from other localities\r\n  only 0·3 per cent. harboured the parasite. Leisering found almost the\r\n  same figures, but in rats from slaughterhouses 5·3 per cent. were\r\n  infected.\r\n\r\nThe geographical distribution of _T. spiralis_ does not correspond with\r\nthe occurrence of trichinosis in man; local customs are an important\r\nfactor; for instance, the custom of eating pork in a condition that\r\ndoes not affect the life of the enclosed trichinella. In places where\r\nsuch customs do not prevail, epidemics do not occur--at the most there\r\nare isolated cases of the disease, although there be a great number of\r\ninfected pigs. The following conditions prevail in North America: In\r\nBoston, Billings found that 4 to 5·7 per cent. of the pigs examined\r\nwere trichinous; Belfield and Atwood found that 8 per cent. were\r\ninfected in Chicago; Salmon found on an average that 2·7 per cent. were\r\ninfected (but at various places the percentage fluctuated between 0·28\r\nto 16·3 per cent.), yet epidemics of trichinosis hardly ever occur in\r\nNorth America, and only isolated cases of the disease are met with in\r\nGerman immigrants, who keep to their native customs.\r\n\r\n  This report, according to the researches of H. U. Williams, must be\r\n  considerably modified. This author has examined the muscular system\r\n  of human cadavers according to the method employed by inspectors of\r\n  meat for pigs. The investigations were conducted in the Pathological\r\n  Institute of the University of Buffalo, and the observer has examined\r\n  505 bodies since 1894, of which 27 (= 5·34 per cent.) were invaded by\r\n  Trichinella. The cases, according to the nationality, are divided as\r\n  follows:--\r\n\r\n  ---------------------+----------+--------+---------+-------------\r\n                       |          |   Trichinella    | Percentage\r\n                       | Examined +--------+---------+ of positive\r\n                       |          | Absent | Present |   results\r\n  ---------------------+----------+--------+---------+-------------\r\n   Americans:          |          |        |         |\r\n     (_a_) Whites      |   207    |   201  |    6    |    2·89\r\n     (_b_) Negroes     |    70    |    65  |    5    |    7·14\r\n   British and Irish   |    62    |    57  |    5    |    8·06\r\n   Canadians           |    12    |    10  |    2    |   16·66\r\n   Germans             |    49    |    43  |    6    |   12·24\r\n   Italians            |    12    |    10  |    2    |   16·66\r\n   Other nationalities |    27    |    27  |    0    |       0\r\n   Nationality unknown |    66    |    65  |    1    |    1·51\r\n  ---------------------+----------+--------+---------+-------------\r\n         Total         |   505    |   478  |   27    |    5·34\r\n  ---------------------+----------+--------+---------+-------------\r\n\r\n  It is worthy of remark that half of all the positive cases were\r\n  mental patients, who were found to be affected with Trichinella\r\n  to well-nigh 12 per cent. Trichinosis was not, however, the cause\r\n  of death in any case. Very frequently the Trichinellæ were found\r\n  calcified and dead.\r\n\r\nConditions are similar in most countries of Europe, where, of course,\r\nthe number of infected pigs is considerably smaller, but the disease\r\ndepends less on this than on the way in which the pork is prepared.\r\n\r\nCases of trichinosis have been known to occur in nearly all the\r\ncountries of Europe; further, in Egypt, Algeria, East Africa, Syria,\r\nIndia, Australia, and America. North Germany, more especially the\r\nSaxe-Thüringian states, is the classical land for epidemics of\r\ntrichinosis; the mortality varies, but it may be very high.[306]\r\n\r\n[306] For instance, extensive epidemics occurred in Hettstädt in\r\n1863 (160 patients, 28 deaths); Hanover, 1864–1865 (more than 300\r\npatients); Hadersleben, 1865 (337 patients, 101 deaths); Potsdam, 1866\r\n(164 patients); Greifswald, 1866 (140 cases, 1 death); Magdeburg, 1866\r\n(240 cases, 16 deaths); Halberstadt, 1867 (100 cases, 20 deaths);\r\nStassfurt, 1869 (over 100 cases); Wernigerode, 1873 (100 cases, 1\r\ndeath); Chemnitz (194 cases, 3 deaths); Linden, 1874 (400 cases, 140\r\ndeaths); Niederzwohren, near Cassel, 1877 (half the population);\r\nDiedenhofen, 1877 (99 cases, 10 deaths); Leipzig, 1877 (134 cases, 2\r\ndeaths); Ernsleben, 1883 (403 cases, 66 deaths); Strenz-Neuendorf,\r\n1884 (86 cases, 12 deaths), etc. According to Johne, 109 epidemics,\r\nwith 3,402 cases and 79 deaths, occurred in Saxony between 1860 and\r\n1889. Stiles, in a work recently published, states that there were\r\n8,491 cases of trichinosis with 513 deaths (6·04 per cent.) in Germany\r\nfrom 1860 to 1880; and 6,329 cases and 318 deaths (5·02 per cent.)\r\nbetween 1881–1898. Of these latter, 1881–1898, 3,822 (225 deaths)\r\noccurred in Prussia, 1,634 (76 deaths) in Saxony, and 873 (17 deaths)\r\nin the remaining states. There is, however, no doubt that many deaths\r\nfrom trichinosis were not recognized, as proved by experience at\r\n_post-mortems_.\r\n\r\n  _Prophylaxis._--The grave nature of the disease and the comparatively\r\n  high mortality relating to trichinosis led the authorities to adopt\r\n  certain preventive measures, which are the more necessary as national\r\n  customs cannot be altered in a short time. As the usual process of\r\n  pickling and smoking, even when long continued, does not certainly\r\n  ensure the death of the Trichinellæ contained in the meat, and also\r\n  because in roasting and boiling large pieces of pork a considerable\r\n  time is necessary to permit the temperature required to kill off the\r\n  parasites (62° to 70° C.) to penetrate to the middle of the joint,\r\n  it appeared to be most practical to have all pigs microscopically\r\n  examined for Trichinellæ before they, or parts of them, were placed\r\n  on the market, and all infected meat condemned, no matter whether the\r\n  Trichinellæ were present in large or small numbers, still undeveloped\r\n  or calcified. Since 1877 obligatory examination of pork has been\r\n  introduced in Prussia, though as yet it is not thoroughly carried\r\n  out; other states of North Germany as well as the larger towns of\r\n  South Germany soon followed; a complete army of trichina inspectors,\r\n  officially examined and periodically controlled by experts, and\r\n  whose number in Prussia amounted to 27,602 in 1896, this being even\r\n  increased to 28,224 in 1899, have the charge of examining pork on\r\n  certain lines laid down. These are at the present time uniformly\r\n  administered. The proceeding is usually that the trichina inspector\r\n  himself goes to the slaughterhouses, or special samplers take pieces\r\n  of the muscles that are known to be the favourite seats of the\r\n  parasite (pillars of the diaphragm, the costal part of the diaphragm,\r\n  muscles of the tongue and larynx, intercostal and abdominal muscles);\r\n  six small portions are separated from each piece, pressed between\r\n  slides or special compressors, and carefully gone through by\r\n  examining them with a low power of the microscope. The pigs free\r\n  from Trichinellæ are passed for commerce; trichinous pigs, on the\r\n  other hand, in Prussia, are only allowed to be used for industrial\r\n  purposes, _i.e._, the hide and bristles are used, the fat is allowed\r\n  to be melted down, or certain parts are used for the manufacture of\r\n  soap or glue. In Saxony, however, it is still permitted to place\r\n  trichinous flesh on the market, fully declaring its nature, and after\r\n  having been heated to its deepest strata at a temperature of 100° C.\r\n  in a suitable apparatus, and under the supervision of a veterinary\r\n  surgeon.\r\n\r\n  AS TO THE PROPORTION OF TRICHINOUS PIGS to healthy ones, the\r\n  following tables give the figures for Prussia:--\r\n\r\n  ------+---------------+-----------------+------------\r\n        |   Number of   |    Number of    |\r\n   Year | pigs examined | trichinous pigs | Proportion\r\n  ------+---------------+-----------------+------------\r\n   1878 |   2,524,105   |      1,222      | 1 :  2,065\r\n   1879 |   3,164,656   |      1,938      | 1 :  1,632\r\n   1881 |   3,118,780   |      1,695      | 1 :  1,839\r\n   1882 |   3,808,142   |      1,852      | 1 :  2,056\r\n   1883 |   4,248,767   |      2,199      | 1 :  1,932\r\n   1884 |   4,611,689   |      2,624      | 1 :  1,741\r\n   1885 |   4,421,208   |      2,387      | 1 :  1,852\r\n   1886 |   4,834,898   |      2,114      | 1 :  2,287\r\n   1887 |   5,486,416   |      2,776      | 1 :  1,988\r\n   1888 |   6,051,249   |      3,111      | 1 :  1,945\r\n   1889 |   5,500,678   |      3,026      | 1 :  1,818\r\n   1890 |   5,590,510   |      1,756      | 1 :  3,183\r\n   1891 |   6,550,182   |      2,187      | 1 :  2,996\r\n   1892 |   6,234,559   |      2,085      | 1 :  2,992\r\n   1896 |   8,759,490   |      1,877      | 1 :  4,666\r\n   1899 |   9,230,353   |      1,021      | 1 :  9,040\r\n   1902 |   9,093,210   |        725      | 1 : 12,397\r\n  ------+---------------+-----------------+------------\r\n\r\n  The proportion, however, is not only subject to variation in separate\r\n  years, but differs according to the district; thus, in 1884, in the\r\n  state district of Minden there was one trichinous pig to 30,146\r\n  healthy animals, in Erfurt 1 to 14,563, in the district of Gnesen 1\r\n  to 101, in Schrimm 1 to 86, and in Schroda 1 to 68.\r\n\r\n  In Germany Trichinella is becoming LESS COMMON in pigs (Ostertag):--\r\n\r\n       (_a_) _Prussia._\r\n\r\n                    Pigs found\r\n    Year         to be trichinous\r\n  1878–1885    0·061–0·048 per cent.\r\n  1886–1892    0·033–0·043    \"\r\n  1896         0·021          \"\r\n  1899         0·014          \"\r\n  1902         0·011          \"\r\n\r\n       (_b_) Saxony.\r\n\r\n              Number of pigs\r\n  Year     found to be trichinous\r\n  1891         0·014 per cent.\r\n  1892         0·011    \"\r\n  1893         0·008    \"\r\n  1894         0·007    \"\r\n  1895         0·012    \"\r\n  1896         0·0102   \"\r\n  1899         0·004    \"\r\n  1902         0·0056   \"\r\n\r\n       (_c_) City of Berlin.\r\n\r\n                  Number of pigs\r\n    Year      found to be trichinous\r\n  1883–1893   0·035–0·064 per cent.\r\n  1893–1897   0·022–0·015     \"\r\n  1902         0·006          \"\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the excellent preventive measure of official\r\ninspection for Trichinella has led to the avoidance of grave disasters;\r\nits introduction has not yet caused an entire cessation of trichinosis\r\nin man, because inspection of pork is not obligatory everywhere, so\r\nthat human beings may become infected by unexamined trichinous pigs\r\nfrom their own country or from abroad, and also because an infection\r\nmay occasionally escape notice. For these reasons the meat imported\r\ninto Berlin from abroad as free from Trichinæ is examined again and not\r\nalways in vain; finally, also, gross negligence may at times occur, or\r\nfatal errors may be made.\r\n\r\nIn addition _private prophylaxis_ must not be neglected, and its chief\r\naim should be directed to the suitable preparation of pork.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Dioctophymidæ.*\r\n\r\nGenus. *Dioctophyme*, Collet-Megret, 1802.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Eustrongylus_, Dies., 1851.\r\n\r\n  Large worms. Anterior extremity unarmed; the mouth is surrounded by\r\n  six papillæ. One ovary.

Tand., 1860; _Eustrongylus visceralis_,\r\n  Raill., 1885.\r\n\r\nColour blood-red; the anterior extremity somewhat slender; there is a\r\nseries of about 150 papillæ along the lateral lines; the sub-median\r\nlines are strongly developed, and from them spring the radial muscles\r\nfor the intestine.\r\n\r\nThe males attain a length of 40 cm. and a diameter of 4 to 6 mm.; the\r\nposterior extremity is transversely truncated; the anal orifice is\r\nwithin the base of the collar-like bursa, the thickened edges of which\r\nare beset with papillæ; the spicule measures 5 to 6 mm. in length.\r\n\r\nThe females attain a length of 100 cm. and a breadth of 12 mm. The anus\r\nis crescent-shaped and terminal. The vulva is 50 to 70 mm. distant\r\nfrom the anterior extremity. The eggs are oval and have a thick shell\r\npresenting numerous depressions; the shell itself is brownish, but it\r\nis colourless at the somewhat thickened poles; it measures 60 µ in\r\nlength by 40 µ in breadth. The larva measures 240 µ by 14 µ.\r\n\r\n_Dioctophyme gigas_ lives in the pelvis of the kidney, more rarely in\r\nthe abdominal cavity of the seal, otter, dog, wolf, fox, horse, marten\r\nand polecat, exceptionally also in human beings. It also occurs in\r\ntumours of the mamma and perinæum. Most of the cases in which this\r\nparasite has been reported as occurring in man may be traced back\r\nto unrecognized _Ascaris lumbricoides_ or to clots of fibrin; seven\r\ncertain cases, eight more or less doubtful, however, remain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 306.--_Dioctophyme gigas_, male.

(After Railliet.)]\r\n\r\nThe source of infection is unknown, but according to Balbiani the\r\neggs develop an embryo in water or moist soil, and this embryo may\r\nremain alive several years without hatching; the infection of dogs\r\nwith embryo-containing eggs did not succeed; an intermediate stage in\r\nfishes is conjectured, but still the infection of cattle and horses is\r\nunintelligible.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Strongylidæ.*\r\n\r\nSub-family. *Metastrongylinæ*, Leiper, 1908.\r\n\r\nBuccal capsule absent or slightly developed, vagina elongate,\r\nuteri convergent[307] and have a simple musculature. Parasitic in\r\nthe respiratory or circulatory system. Genera: Metastrongylus,\r\nSynthetocaulus.\r\n\r\n[307] Convergent: _i.e._, the uteri are parallel, converging from the\r\nanterior part of body to the vagina, which is near the anus, this\r\nposition being associated with convergence of the uteri. Divergent:\r\nUteri run anterior and posterior, diverging from the vagina, which in\r\nthis case is near middle of body.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Metastrongylus*, Molin, 1861.\r\n\r\nMouth with six lips, of which the two lateral are the largest. Postero-\r\nand postero-external rays[308] of bursa thin, the rest thick. Only the\r\nmedian ray double. Spicules very long and slender, striated. Vulva\r\nimmediately in front of anus.

The females measure 20 to 50 mm. in length, the anus is close\r\nin front of the posterior extremity, which has a recurved, hook-like\r\nprocess; the vulva is close in front of the anus. The eggs are\r\nelliptical, 57 µ to 100 µ in length, 39 µ to 72 µ in breadth; when the\r\neggs are deposited the embryo is already formed, 220 µ to 350 µ by 10 µ\r\nto 12 µ.\r\n\r\n_Metastrongylus apri_ frequently lives in the bronchial tubes--usually\r\nthe smaller ones--of the pig[309] and wild boar; it is also found\r\noccasionally in sheep and in man; in young pigs it is apt to set up a\r\nbronchitis, which frequently causes death.\r\n\r\n[309] The reports of the city inspection of meat in Berlin state that\r\n_Strongylidæ_ in the lungs of pigs are by no means rare; therefore the\r\nlungs of 1,941 pigs were condemned between 1885–1886, of 1,641 between\r\n1886–1887, of 3,237 between 1887–1888, of 4,855 between 1888–1889, of\r\n7,197 between 1889–1890, and of 5,574 pigs between 1890–1891, etc.\r\nOstertag found _Strongylus apri_ in 60 per cent. of the pigs examined\r\nin the Berlin abattoir; Meyer, in Leipzig, found the parasite in 15 per\r\ncent. of the native pigs and in 52 per cent. of the Hungarian pigs.\r\n\r\nThe first communication as to the occurrence of this species in man\r\nwas that of Diesing, who, in 1845, in Klausenburg, had the opportunity\r\nof examining _Strongylidæ_ found by Jortsits in the lung of a little\r\nboy, aged 6, in Transylvania; probably also the Nematodes found in the\r\ntrachea and larynx of man, and described by Rainey and Bristowe as\r\nspecimens of _Filaria trachealis_, belong to this group; according to\r\nChatin, _Metastrongylus apri_ may also occur in the intestine of man;\r\nthis occurrence, however, may in all probability have been due to an\r\naccidental introduction of adult worms into the intestine, and should\r\nnot be attributed to an infection by the larval stage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 308.--_Metastrongylus apri_: one side of bursa.\r\n_a._, anterior; _a.e._, antero-external; _a.m._, antero-median; _p.m._,\r\npostero-median; _p.e._, postero-external; _p._, one division of\r\nposterior ray.

(After Thomas.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n*Œsophagostomum apiostomum*, Willach, 1891.\r\n\r\nAccording to Leiper, _Œs. brumpti_ is identical with, and hence a\r\nsynonym of, this species. Parasitic in large intestines of monkeys,\r\nproducing dysentery, and in man (Northern Nigeria).\r\n\r\nAccording to Walker this species is common in Philippine monkeys. Ova\r\nare scanty in the fæces. They measure 73 µ to 84 µ by 44 µ to 57 µ and\r\nare in the morula stage. They are easily cultivated. The rhabditiform\r\nlarva is 340 µ by 16 µ and has a long filiform tail. It moults twice,\r\nand at the second moult becomes a filariform larva retaining the skin\r\nof this moult, this stage being that of the mature larva. It now\r\nmeasures 9 mm. long by 30 µ thick. Walker suggests that the mode of\r\ninfection is similar to that of ancylostomes.\r\n\r\n\r\nGroup. *Ancylostomeæ*, Railliet and Henry, 1909.\r\n\r\nBursa with anterior ray cleft, median double,[314] postero- and\r\npostero-external arising from a common trunk, posterior bifurcate,\r\neach limb being tridigitate.

Each bifurcation is trifurcate\r\nrather than tridigitate.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Ancylostoma*, Dubini, 1843, emend. Looss, 1905.\r\n\r\nVentral margin of mouth capsule armed with teeth, the “roots” of which\r\nare continued backwards and appear on the _external_ surface of capsule\r\nas rib-like thickenings. Terminal third of dorsal ray cleft. Genital\r\ntubes very long, with short, closely packed diagonal convolutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Ancylostoma duodenale*, Dubini, 1843.\r\n\r\nMale 9 mm. long by 0·45 mm. thick, female 12 mm. long by 0·6 mm. thick.\r\nPale flesh colour, or an intense red in posterior third. Anteriorly may\r\nbe more or less black due to (blood) pigment in the cells of the chyle\r\nintestine (= stomach + small intestine). The worm is about the same\r\nthickness all through and is plump and rigid. Cuticle striated. The\r\nbody has a marked torsion, so that if the ventral side of the head is\r\nupwards the anus appears to open laterally and _vice versâ_. The dorsal\r\ncurve of the head end is only slight and the œsophagus is roughly\r\ncylindrical.\r\n\r\n_Buccal Capsule._--The buccal capsule is bent dorsally, 0·21 mm. long,\r\n0·19 mm. broad. If a worm is rolled under the cover-glass so that the\r\ndorsal side is upwards, we observe the following features (fig. 325):\r\nIn the dorsal edge of the chitinous capsule there is a gap as if a\r\n*U*-piece had been punched out. This is the “dorsal gap or incision.”\r\nThe so-called “dorsal teeth” are simply the rounded edges of the tips\r\nof this gap. They project _beyond_ the skin which covers the capsule\r\nexternally. Below this gap is seen a curved line which, if followed\r\nalong the sides of the capsule on each side, merges into the base of\r\nthe most posterior ventral tooth. This line is the optical expression\r\nof a very shallow groove on the _inside_ of the capsule. The skin\r\non the outside of the capsule, which is reflected over the edge of\r\nand into the capsule, dips into this groove, which gives it a firm\r\nattachment. Below the middle (dorsally) of this curved line there is\r\na thickening in the capsule wall, which is perforated by the opening\r\nof the dorsal œsophageal gland. This is the “dorsal ridge”; in optical\r\nsection it has a conical appearance with a lumen (of the duct).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 323.--_Ancylostoma duodenale_, male. _B_, bursa;\r\n_Bm_, bursal muscles; _Cdr_, cement gland surrounding the ejaculatory\r\nduct; _Glc_, cervical glands; _N_, nucleus of cephalic gland; _Nr_,\r\nnerve ring; _T_, testes; _Sp_, spicule; _Vs_, vesicula seminalis. × 15.\r\n(After Looss.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 324.--_Ancylostoma duodenale_, female. _A_, anus;\r\n_Gcph_, cephalic gland; _N_, nucleus of cephalic gland; _Glc_, cervical\r\ngland; _Ov_, ovary; _Pex_, excretory pore; _Rs_, receptaculum seminis;\r\n_Ut_, uterus; _V_, vagina. × 15. (After Looss.)]\r\n\r\nOn the ventral wall one sees the two pairs of strong teeth, their\r\npoints being directed somewhat backwards. They are covered by cuticle\r\nabove and below, but their points are free, piercing the cuticle. The\r\n“roots” of these teeth followed backwards appear as two thickenings\r\nor ribs on the _outside_ of the capsule wall, so that the outside\r\nwall is not smooth--a characteristic of the genus Ancylostoma. In the\r\nspace between these ribs lies the ventral nerve papilla, and lying\r\nagainst the outside of the outer root the lateral nerve papilla. The\r\nnerve papillæ are thus, as it were, concealed by these roots, and not\r\nconspicuous as they are in Necator. Following the ventral curve of the\r\ncapsule on the inside, posteriorly we next find two triangular ventral\r\nlancets.[316] These stand straight up into the capsule on either side\r\nof the longitudinal axis, converging at their summits. So that to sum\r\nup, the cutting apparatus is entirely ventral, consisting of two pairs\r\nof cutting teeth and a pair of lancets.\r\n\r\n[316] The ventral lancet (of one side) of Necator is seen in fig. 335.\r\n\r\n_Cervical Papillæ._--Two, one on each side behind the head at the level\r\nof the excretory pore. They consist of “pulp,” _i.e._, extensions of\r\nthe substance of the lateral bands covered by cuticle and supplied with\r\na nerve (fig. 326).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 325.--_Ancylostoma duodenale_: showing ventral\r\nteeth, dorsal cleft, and behind it the dorsal ridge with duct of dorsal\r\nœsophageal gland. × c. 200. (After Looss.)]\r\n\r\n_Œsophageal Glands_ (3).--The chitin of the triradiate œsophagus is\r\ncontinuous with that of the buccal capsule. In its muscular walls are\r\nthree glands--one dorsal, two sub-ventral. The dorsal gland opens into\r\nthe buccal cavity through the dorsal ridge; the two others into the\r\nlumen of the œsophagus at the nerve ring. They branch freely amidst the\r\nmuscles. They are probably digestive in function.\r\n\r\n_Cephalic Glands_ (2).--Lie in the lateral lines or bands on either\r\nside. They begin about the middle line of the body, and their ducts\r\nopen at the base of the outer ventral tooth on the surface of the skin\r\non each side. Each is 0·15 mm. thick in the middle, and has a single\r\nnucleus about as big as an ancylostome egg (_N_, fig. 323). They\r\nprobably function as poison glands.\r\n\r\n_Excretory System and Cervical Glands_ (2).--The excretory pore lies\r\nin the mid line ventrally behind the œsophageal nerve ring (figs. 324\r\nand 326). It opens into the excretory vesicle, a cavity in a large\r\ncell with lateral appendages which fuse with the lateral lines, this\r\ncell thus forming the “bridge” of the excretory system. Adhering to\r\nthis (bridge) cell are the spindle-shaped cervical glands (_Glc_,\r\nfig. 324), and branches from the excretory vesicle enter the glands,\r\nwhich are excretory in function; the vesicle also receives branches\r\nfrom the lateral excretory canals (fig. 326) running in the lateral\r\nlines or bands. The cervical glands are swollen anteriorly, forming the\r\nso-called ampullæ just in front of the bridge. They extend backwards a\r\nlittle beyond the anterior loop of the testis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 326.--_Ancylostoma duodenale_: diagrammatic\r\nrepresentation of excretory system. _ex.p._, excretory pore; _e.c.g._,\r\nexcretory cervical gland; _Ex. ves._, excretory vesicle in _B.c._,\r\nbridge cell, which is connected with _c.g._, cervical gland, and\r\n_l.l._, lateral lines; _ceph.g._, cephalic gland; _l.ex.c._, lateral\r\nexcretory canal passing into the bridge cell; l.l., lateral line\r\ncontaining excretory canal and cephalic gland; _c.p._, cervical\r\npapilla; _n._, nuclei of bridge cell. (After a drawing of Looss.)]\r\n\r\n_Lateral Lines._--(1) Are broad elevations of the subcuticle, in which,\r\nhere and there, a nucleus occurs. (2) Near the bursa in the male they\r\nincrease in volume, and finally divide into branches which form the\r\n“pulp” of the different rays. (3) In addition to the lateral lines or\r\nbands, there is also a dorsal and ventral band. (4) The ventral band\r\nis well developed caudally, forming a large pad dorsal to the cloaca,\r\n“pulvillus post-analis.”\r\n\r\nThe bursal rays are outgrowths of the lateral lines. Beside this “pulp”\r\nthey contain a nerve, and at their bases complex muscles.\r\n\r\n_The Bursa_ is closed on all sides with a short median (ventral) lobe,\r\nwhich may be tucked inwards. It is an outgrowth of the inner layer of\r\nthe skin pushing the outer layer before it, so that it consists of\r\nthree layers, not four, as it would be if it were a fold. The bursa\r\nis twice as broad as long. It is supported by a variety of rays, the\r\narrangement of which is best followed from the figure (fig. 327).\r\nThe different terminology for these rays as used by various authors\r\nshould be noted: Ventral = anterior; externo-lateral = antero-external;\r\nmedio-lateral + postero-lateral or antero-median + postero-median\r\n= median (doubled); externo-dorsal = postero-external; dorsal =\r\nposterior. All the rays end in tactile papillæ, seven, on each side;\r\nthe postero-external and antero-external on the _outer_ surface of the\r\nbursa, the five others on the _inner_ surface.[317] Of the six terminal\r\ndigitations of the _dorsal_ ray, only the external two contain tactile\r\npapillæ.\r\n\r\n[317] This also occurs in other _Strongylidæ_, _e.g._, in the genus\r\nStrongylus (Syn.: Sclerostomum).\r\n\r\nIn the male there are prebursal papillæ and minute caudal papillæ in\r\nthe female.\r\n\r\nIn the female the inner layer of the cuticle projects at the posterior\r\nend as a sharp spike, 20 µ long, which may sometimes be broken off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 327.--_Ancylostoma duodenale_: bursa enlarged.\r\n_Ca_, anterior ray cleft; _cle_, antero-external; _cls_, antero-median;\r\n_clp_, postero-median; _Cde_, postero external; _Cd_, posterior\r\nbifurcated, each bifurcation tridigitate. (After Railliet.)]\r\n\r\n_Ovaries._--The anterior tube runs from the cephalic to the posterior\r\nend and back again. The posterior tube begins anteriorly, runs to\r\nthe posterior end of the body, and then back to the cephalic end,\r\nforming a vulval loop before ending. The ovaries on the whole run in\r\noblique coils. The uterus is the thicker portion of the tube, 5 mm.\r\nlong. A short tube connecting the ovary and uterus is the oviduct.\r\nThe two uteri unite to form a single duct, the vagina, opening 1 mm.\r\n_behind_ the middle line. The portion of the uterus next to the oviduct\r\nfunctions as a seminal receptacle, whereas the part next the vagina\r\nfunctions as an ovejector.\r\n\r\n_Testis._--The blind end begins a little behind the beginning of the\r\n_cement gland_. The transverse coils occupy the middle third of the\r\nbody. About the middle of the body it passes into the spindle-shaped\r\nseminal vesicle, which, with the spicular canal and rectum, opens\r\ninto the cloaca. An anterior longitudinal coil pushing in between the\r\ncervical glands is characteristic of Ancylostoma. The cement gland\r\nsurrounds the ejaculatory duct for practically its whole course, and it\r\noccupies nearly the posterior half of the body and secretes a brown or\r\nblack cement. The spermatozoa are curved rods about 2 µ long.\r\n\r\n_Spicules_ are 2 mm. long, ending in a fine point. They are moved by\r\nexsertor and retractor muscles. At first they lie free in the body\r\ncavity; next in a groove in the dorsal wall of the cloaca; then in an\r\nisolated canal, and finally in two canals. Anteriorly each has two\r\nlongitudinal crests on its inner surface. These meet the corresponding\r\ncrests of the other spicule, and so form a canal along which the sperm\r\npasses into the female. The gubernaculum is a thickening of the dorsal\r\nwall of the cloaca. It is not a free piece, but is moved by various\r\nmuscles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 328.--_Ancylostoma duodenale_: bursa of male. The\r\nrays from left to right are: (1) anterior cleft; (2) antero-external;\r\n(3) and (4) median doubled, _i.e._, antero-median and postero-median;\r\n(5) postero-external arising from a common trunk with the posterior. ×\r\nc. 120. (After Looss.)]\r\n\r\n_Genital Cone_ is a prominence on the floor of the bursa on the ventral\r\nside of the body, on which the genito-anal orifice opens. The cone\r\nis only slightly marked in _Ancylostoma duodenale_, but is much more\r\nprominent in _Necator americanus_.\r\n\r\n_Distribution._--Africa, Egypt, Europe, Japan, China (mainly), but in\r\nassociation with _Necator americanus_ in Southern States of America,\r\nBritish India, Assam, Burma, Hongkong, Liberia, Jamaica, Martinique,\r\nCosta Rica, Colombia, Antigua, Guadeloupe.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--The worms live in the jejunum, less frequently in the\r\nduodenum, of man only.\r\n\r\n_Food._--The worms feed on the mucous membrane of the gut, attaching\r\nthemselves to the base of the villi, sucking these in; and when these\r\nare destroyed they attack further the submucosa. As a rule the worms\r\nhave no blood in the gut, but in their attack on the submucosa a\r\nblood-vessel may be eroded, and so the gut of the worm filled with\r\nblood.\r\n\r\n_Development._--The eggs are oval with broadly rounded poles, 56 µ\r\nto 61 µ by 34 µ to 38 µ. In _fresh_ fæces they contain four granular\r\nnucleated segmentation masses of the ovum (fig. 329) separated by a\r\nclear space from the shell.\r\n\r\n_Egg of Ancylostome_ appears to have a single contour. Under high\r\npowers this appears double, but they are the outer and inner surface\r\nof the true (chitinous) egg-shell. Internal to this is the extremely\r\ndelicate yolk-envelope, a kind of skin secreted by the egg cell around\r\nitself for protection. The function of this is probably to absorb water\r\nto swell and burst the outer chitinous shell. The embryos when hatched\r\nare termed larvæ.\r\n\r\n_Embryos_ which are ready to hatch have their bodies almost free from\r\ngranules; others, though apparently mature, that have granules will not\r\nhatch.[318]\r\n\r\n[318] TABLE OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN LARVÆ OF _A. duodenale_ AND _S.\r\nstercoralis_.\r\n\r\n  --------------+----------------------+------------------------------\r\n                |   _A. duodenale_     |     _S. stercoralis_\r\n  --------------+----------------------+------------------------------\r\n  (1) Vestibulum|                      |                }\r\n        oris    |1·8 µ broad           |3 µ             }Rhabditiform.\r\n  (2) Genital   |                      |                }\r\n        rudiment|3 µ to 5 µ long       |25 µ to 33 µ    }\r\n                |                      |\r\n  (3) Thickness |Thicker               |       --       }\r\n  (4) Œsophagus |One-fourth body length|Half body length}\r\n  (5) Tail      |Pointed               |Two fine points }Filariform.\r\n  (6) Motion    |Less active than      |       --       }\r\n  (7) Gut       |Soon fills with dark  |                }\r\n                | granules             |       --       }\r\n  --------------+----------------------+------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 329.--_Ancylostoma duodenale_: eggs in different\r\nstages of development. _a_ to _c_, in fresh fæces; _d_, containing a\r\nlarva, only in old fæces. × 336. (After Looss.)]\r\n\r\n_Larva._--_Stage I_: Average length, 25 mm. Maximum thickness in\r\nœsophageal region, 17 µ. Head end fairly blunt, from behind the\r\nanus (the tail) tapering in an uniform manner. Buccal cavity is\r\ncharacteristic, 10 µ to 12 µ by 1 µ to 8 µ, longer and narrower than\r\nthe corresponding larvæ of _Strongyloides stercoralis_. Œsophagus\r\n“rhabditic” in character, _i.e._, it has three sections, but they are\r\nnot so clearly marked off as in larvæ of the genus Rhabditis. The\r\nposterior bulb has a *Y*-shaped valve, the function of which, according\r\nto Looss, is to prevent regurgitation of food. The granules of the gut\r\nserve as a reserve of food, and are used up if the larvæ are starved.\r\nThe _genital rudiment_ consists of two cells half-way between the end\r\nof the œsophagus and the anus in the mid-ventral line. The larva lives\r\non fæcal matter and grows to about 0·4 mm., then moult[319] I takes\r\nplace in two days or more, the skin being ruptured by the activity of\r\nthe larva.\r\n\r\n[319] Moults take place by the formation of a new skin below the old\r\none, the two being in close apposition at first.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 330.--_Ancylostoma duodenale_ larva on fourth day\r\nof culture on right; _Strongyloides stercoralis_ larva on left. (After\r\nLeichtenstern.)]\r\n\r\n_Stage II_: The larva is now in this stage, which does not differ much\r\nfrom the previous one. It grows to 0·5 mm. The mouth opening closes.\r\nThe œsophagus elongates, becoming cylindrical or “filariform”; a new\r\nskin is formed underneath the old one, and in about a week moult II\r\ntakes place.\r\n\r\n_Stage III_: The _mature larva_ remains enclosed in the old skin. Its\r\nmovements are now much more active and of a boring character. Length is\r\nnow 0·6 mm. This mature stage has been erroneously called the encysted\r\nlarva, because there is no cyst _secreted_ from its surface by the\r\nlarva, but it is simply the old skin, which is not cast off, but is\r\nretained for purposes of protection, as the larva is free living, but\r\ncasts it as soon as it assumes parasitic life again. From the egg to\r\nthis mature stage is thus six to ten days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 331.--_Ancylostoma duodenale_: left, four days\r\nafter transmission into dog, 190/1; in the centre, at the commencement\r\nof the second stage of development (five to six days), 105/1; on the\r\nright, fourteen to fifteen days after transmission. 42/1. (After\r\nLooss.)]\r\n\r\n_Bionomics of Development._--_Air_: Eggs can develop when shut off from\r\nthe air for a “comparatively long” time.\r\n\r\n_Temperature_: Hatching takes from eight hours upwards. Eggs develop\r\nbest at 25° to 30° C., but will not develop below 8° to 10° C. The\r\nlarvæ, however, will stand freezing.\r\n\r\n_Moisture_: Eggs and larvæ do not live long under water, because they\r\nsuffocate or starve, but _mature_ larvæ will live for months (six to\r\ntwelve) in water; they require no food--in fact, can take none in--but\r\nlive on their reserve granules, and in course of time become as clear\r\nas glass.\r\n\r\n_Thigmotropism_: The mature larvæ, after casting their skin, will\r\npenetrate pith, climb up stems, stalks, etc., and creep into any pore.\r\n\r\nIt is important to recognize that this third stage of the _mature\r\nlarva_ is the only infective one.\r\n\r\n_Mode of Entry into the Body._--Infection is effected through the mouth\r\n(Leichtenstern and others), and also through the skin, as was first\r\ndiscovered by Looss and afterwards confirmed from the most diverse\r\nquarters, partly in the case of _Ancylostoma duodenale_, partly in\r\nthat of _A. caninum_ in dog, man, and monkey. The larvæ that gain\r\naccess to the intestine partly through contaminated food, or through\r\nunwashed hands, or under some circumstances through water, first throw\r\noff their “sheath”--that is, they complete moult II. Moult III takes\r\nplace four to five days after they have reached the gut, and they now\r\nhave a mouth capsule supplied with four small teeth arranged crosswise,\r\nenabling them to fasten on to the intestinal epithelium, upon which\r\nthey feed. On this food the worms grow in four to six days to 3 to\r\n5 mm. in length, and now moult IV. takes place, thus attaining their\r\ndefinite shape and distinctive character. About eight days later the\r\nsexual organs commence to function; at this time the first copulation\r\nshould be taking place--it will later be frequently repeated--and a few\r\ndays later the first ova are laid, first in less and later in larger\r\nnumbers, so that they appear in the fæces about four to five weeks\r\nafter the infection.[320]\r\n\r\n[320] From the number of eggs present in a given quantity of fæces, the\r\nnumber of female Ancylostomes present in the gut can be reckoned by\r\na formula of Leichtenstern’s (x = _a_/47, in which _a_ signifies the\r\nnumber of eggs counted in a single gramme of fæces).\r\n\r\n_Infection by the Skin._--Mature larvæ, which are placed on the skin of\r\nman or suitable animals, cast their “sheath” and bore their way through\r\ndelicate fissures either horizontal in the superficial scales of the\r\nepidermis, or through vertical fissures into hair follicles where these\r\nexist, and then they invade the cutis. Now according as they migrate\r\nfurther into the lymphatic vessels or the small vesicles, the final\r\npath to the gut differs to some extent. The blood path leads to the\r\nright heart, and from there into the lungs; here the larvæ leave the\r\nblood stream and enter the air passages, over the mucosa of which they\r\ntravel further headwards, through the bronchi into the trachea and\r\nlarynx, and from hence through the œsophagus to the stomach; in some\r\ncases also they are swallowed. The lymphatic path leads finally also\r\ninto the blood stream, but the lymphatic glands must first be passed,\r\nand in these many larvæ are retained and perish. In the cutaneous\r\ninfection seven to ten weeks elapse till the time of appearance of the\r\nfirst ova in the fæces.\r\n\r\n  The penetration of the skin by the larvæ also in man causes reddening\r\n  and burning at the affected points, and this is followed in a\r\n  few days by transitory swelling in the subcutaneous connective\r\n  tissue. Skin affections can also be set up by such Ancylostoma\r\n  (and Strongyloides) larvæ as do not gain access to the blood or\r\n  lymphatic vessels or gut; such larvæ apparently wander further in the\r\n  connective tissue, and, as Looss has in his own person observed, gain\r\n  access to the cutis at different points, thus causing progressive\r\n  swellings (accompanied by intense itching), which cease when the\r\n  worm again penetrates into the deep tissues. Skin affections such\r\n  as “ground-itch” or “pani-ghao” occurring in the tropics and only\r\n  attacking the feet, or other affections (_e.g._, sump bunches) are\r\n  now well recognized as being due to the invasion of Ancylostoma larvæ.\r\n\r\n  Other names for these skin affections are water-sore, sore feet of\r\n  coolies, maza-morra, bunches, botches, quaddeln, krätze, ampoules,\r\n  gourmes, taons, pitirr. Whether oral or dermal infection is the more\r\n  important one further observation must decide.\r\n\r\nThe duration of life of _Ancylostoma duodenale_, which is a specific\r\nparasite of man and has not been observed in other mammals, amounts to\r\nabout five years, as strayed larvæ according to Looss wander for this\r\nextent of time in the body.\r\n\r\n_Cultivation of Larvæ._--(1) Mix the fæces (free from drugs such as\r\nsalines or thymol) with animal charcoal, adding water if necessary till\r\na consistence of porridge is obtained. If the stools are very fluid,\r\nallow to sediment first and pour off the fluid. The best charcoal is\r\nthat made from bones, and should not have an acid reaction. Charcoal\r\nis necessary in order to prevent fermentation, which kills the larvæ.\r\nSpread in layers 2 to 3 mm. thick in Petri dishes. Incubate at room\r\ntemperature. To extract the larvæ from the culture allow the surface\r\nthoroughly to dry, then pour on water; the larvæ wander out and are\r\npoured off and subsequently further purified by sedimentation or\r\nfiltering through blotting paper, the larvæ passing through.\r\n\r\n(2) A funnel is plugged with cotton wool, then filled with washed sand\r\nto within a centimetre or two of the rim. Stand this in a jar of water\r\nso that the level of the water is slightly below that of the sand. On\r\nthe surface of the wet sand now place layers of blotting paper, and\r\nspread the fæces, diluted if necessary, on this in layers of a few\r\nmillimetres thick (_vide_ p. 474).\r\n\r\n_Detection of Eggs._--_Vide_ p. 473.\r\n\r\n_Dermal Infection of Dogs._--Infection with larvæ of _A. caninum_. In\r\ntwo hours most of the larvæ are free in the cutis and in four hours in\r\nthe subcutaneous tissue. By scraping a few days later the mucosa of the\r\ntrachea large numbers of larvæ are found there.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Ancylostoma ceylanicum*, Looss, 1911.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 332.--_Ancylostoma ceylanicum_: head end, two teeth\r\non each side, the inner almost concealed by the outer. × c. 200.

(After Looss.)]\r\n\r\nMale 8 mm. long, female 10 mm. The head is strongly bent dorsalwards\r\nso that almost by this character alone it can be distinguished from\r\n_Ancylostoma duodenale_. The buccal capsule is markedly small--in\r\nthe male, 0·093 by 0·084 mm., in the female 0·11 by 0·097 mm. There\r\nare no teeth anteriorly on the ventral side of the capsule, but\r\ninstead there are two cutting chitinous plates, the anterior portions\r\nof which are prominent and angular, and meet in the middle line\r\nin front. Posteriorly on each side the plate projects less, while\r\nbetween the anterior and posterior parts there is a deep angle. The\r\ninner (posterior) ventral lancets which also occur in _A. duodenale_\r\nare large, and project far into the lumen, the tips of these, of the\r\nlateral lancets, and of the dorsal cone almost meeting in the centre of\r\nthe lumen. As already stated in the definition of the genus Necator,\r\nthere are also lateral lancets which start from the base of the dorsal\r\ncone. This dorsal ridge, or rather in this case cone, is a striking\r\nobject in the mouth, and projects right out into the cavity, and on\r\nits summit opens the dorsal œsophageal gland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 335.--_Necator americanus_: lateral view, showing\r\nthe dorsal ridge perforated by the duct of the dorsal œsophageal gland,\r\nthe lateral lancet and ventral lancet and the nerve papillæ. × c. 475.\r\n(After Looss.)]\r\n\r\nThe bursa is about as long as broad, but has the lateral lobes\r\nstrikingly lengthened, giving a trilobed appearance (fig. 336), but\r\nas in _Ancylostoma duodenale_ it is closed on the ventral side. The\r\ndistribution of the rays is best understood from the figure. The\r\ngenital aperture lies on a marked conical protuberance; the cement\r\ngland is bilobed in transverse section. In the female the opening of\r\nthe vulva is in front of the middle line, in _A. duodenale_ it is\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nThe spicules, 0·92 mm. long are hooked at the extremity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 336.--_Necator americanus_: bursa of male.

(After Leiper.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n*Ascaris lumbricoides*, L., 1758.\r\n\r\nThe colouring, in the fresh condition, is reddish-yellow or\r\ngreyish-yellow; the body is of an elongated spindle shape. The oral\r\npapillæ are finely toothed. The dorsal papilla carries two sensory\r\npapillæ, the two ventral papillæ each one sensory papilla. The\r\nmale measures from 15 to 17 to 25 cm. in length, and about 3 mm.\r\nin diameter; the posterior extremity is conical and bent hook-like\r\nventrally; the spicules measure 2 mm. in length, are curved, and\r\nsomewhat broadened at their free end; on each side around the orifice\r\nof the cloaca there are seventy to seventy-five papillæ, of which\r\nseven pairs are post-anal. The testicular tube is much folded, showing\r\nthrough the body integument, and is about eight times the length of\r\nthe body. The female measures 20 to 25 to 40 cm. in length and about\r\n5 mm. in diameter; the posterior extremity is conical and straight.\r\nThe vulva is at the junction of the anterior and middle thirds of the\r\nbody, which, at this point, has a slight ring-like constriction; the\r\nconvoluted ovaries measure ten times the length of the body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 341.--_Ascaris lumbricoides._ _a_, posterior\r\nextremity of the male with the spicules protruding from the orifice of\r\nthe cloaca (_Sp._); _b_, anterior extremity from the dorsal surface,\r\nthe two lobes of the pulp of the lip separated by the “saddle”; _c_,\r\nanterior extremity from the ventral surface; _P._, excretory pore.\r\n(From Claus.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 342.--Ovum of _Ascaris lumbricoides_, with shell\r\nand albuminous envelope. 400/1.]\r\n\r\nThe ova are elliptical with a thick (4 µ) transparent shell (fig. 342)\r\nand an external albuminous coating which forms protuberances; the ova\r\nmeasure 50 µ to 70 µ in length, 40 µ to 50 µ in breadth; they are\r\ndeposited _before_ segmentation; the albuminous coating is stained\r\nyellow by the colouring matter of the fæces, but is sometimes absent.\r\nThe egg cell is unsegmented, it almost completely fills the shell, and\r\nits nucleus is concealed by the large amount of coarse yolk granules.\r\n\r\nAbnormal or unfertilized eggs also occur in fæces. They are\r\ndistinguished by their elongated form (80 µ by 45 µ), irregularly\r\ncylindrical, its contents consisting of refractive granules.\r\n\r\n_Ascaris lumbricoides_ is one of the most frequent parasites of man; it\r\nis distributed all over the inhabited parts of the world, and though\r\nit is particularly frequent in the warmer regions, yet it also occurs\r\nin Finland, Greenland, etc. In temperate climates _A. lumbricoides_\r\noccurs most frequently in young children; it is, moreover, more common\r\namongst country dwellers than amongst the inhabitants of towns, but is\r\nnot lacking in infants, adults and aged persons. As a rule only a few\r\nspecimens are present in the intestine, but many cases are known in\r\ntemperate zones in which several hundreds of worms have been found in\r\nthe same patient. This species is particularly numerous in the negroes\r\nof Africa and America. It occurs also in the monkey, dog and pig (? _A.\r\nsuilla_).\r\n\r\nThe parasite was known in ancient times; the Greeks called it ἐλμινς\r\nστρογγύλη, Plinius termed it _Tinea rotunda_, later on it was named\r\n_Lumbricus teres_. The ἄσκαρις of the Greeks is our Oxyuris.\r\n\r\n  The small intestine is the normal habitat of _Ascaris lumbricoides_;\r\n  the worms, however, often leave this part of the intestine and wander\r\n  into the stomach, whence they are frequently evacuated by vomiting,\r\n  or they may creep through the œsophagus into the pharynx and crawl\r\n  out through the nose or mouth; very rarely they may find their way\r\n  into the Eustachian tube or into the naso-lachrymal duct, or into\r\n  the excretory ducts of the liver and pancreas; exceptionally they\r\n  may gain the trachea, and they have also been found in the abdominal\r\n  cavity. They may bore through adhesions between the intestinal wall\r\n  and the omentum (worm abscess); they occasionally penetrate the\r\n  urinary apparatus and are passed with the urine; in febrile diseases\r\n  _A. lumbricoides_ usually leaves the intestine spontaneously. It is\r\n  obvious that these wanderings may be accompanied by the most serious\r\n  symptoms, but in sensitive persons the invasion of even only a few\r\n  intestinal Ascarides gives rise to a series of almost inexplicable\r\n  symptoms (hysterical, epileptiform attacks, cerebral congestion,\r\n  aphonia, etc.), which cease with the expulsion of the worms, so\r\n  that many authors are driven to the conclusion that these Ascarides\r\n  secrete a toxin. Fortunately, the presence of _A. lumbricoides_ in\r\n  the intestine is easily demonstrated by the microscopical examination\r\n  of the fæces.\r\n\r\n_Development._--Several authors (Gros, Schubart, Richter, Leuckart and\r\nDavaine) have demonstrated that the ova of Ascaris develop in water or\r\nmoist earth after a long period of incubation. Freezing and desiccation\r\n(if not too long) do not injure their powers of development; the\r\nduration of the development depends on the degree of the surrounding\r\ntemperature. At a medium temperature, after a varying period of\r\nincubation, it takes from thirty to forty days for the embryo to become\r\nformed. The spirally rolled up embryo, with its so-called “tooth,”\r\nformed by three papillæ close together, never leaves the egg-shell\r\nin the open, even if the eggs are kept for years under favourable\r\nconditions. Davaine proved that the larvæ hatch out in the intestine of\r\nthe rat, but are again expelled with the fæces; he therefore concluded\r\nthat the hatching likewise takes place within the intestine of man,\r\nbut is followed by the invasion of the larvæ. In the meantime Leuckart\r\nhad sought to infect himself by swallowing embryo-containing eggs,\r\nbut without results; he therefore conjectured that there must be an\r\nintermediary host, and v. Linstow thought he had found it in myriapods\r\n(_Julus guttulatus_). Subsequently, Davaine’s opinion proved correct.\r\nFirst of all Grassi succeeded in infecting himself by swallowing 100\r\nembryo-containing eggs of _Ascaris lumbricoides_; five weeks after\r\ningestion the worms had attained maturity and their ova appeared in\r\nthe fæces. Calandruccio also sought to infect himself, but failed,\r\nyet he succeeded in infecting a little boy aged 7. Lutz also reports\r\na successful experiment which must have been positive, as young worms\r\n5·5 to 18 mm. long were expelled. Lutz proved that the eggs lost their\r\nalbuminous shell by long lying in water and then died when introduced\r\ninto the stomach; this would explain the failure of Leuckart’s\r\nexperiment; in moist earth the albuminous shell is retained. Finally,\r\nEpstein conducted unimpeachable experiments on three children which\r\nplace direct infection with embryo-containing eggs beyond doubt; he,\r\nmoreover, proved that the development of the eggs takes place more\r\nrapidly in the fæces when there is free admission of air, sun, and a\r\nsufficiency of moisture.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, infection occurs partly through water, but principally\r\ndirect from the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Ascaris*, sp.\r\n\r\nWellmann states that yet another species of Ascaris in man occurs in\r\nthe highlands of Angola: up to the present nothing certain is known\r\nabout it (Welland, “Critical Notes on Tropical Diseases of the Angola\r\nHighlands,” _New York Med.

The female is 10 mm. in\r\nlength and 0·6 mm. in diameter; the anus is about 2 mm. in front of\r\nthe tip of the tail; the vulva is in the anterior third of the body;\r\nthe eggs are oval, asymmetrical, with double-contoured shells, and\r\nmeasure 50 µ to 55 µ by 16 µ to 25 µ; they are deposited with clear,\r\nnon-granular tadpole-like embryos already developed.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Adults in large intestine of man. Young forms in small\r\nintestine and often in the appendix.\r\n\r\n  The worm lives in the lower part of the small intestine, cæcum and\r\n  vermiform appendix, and before becoming adult undergoes two or three\r\n  moults (Heller). According to Wagener the worms at times live in the\r\n  gut wall, giving rise to calcareous nodules. When the uterus of the\r\n  fertilized females begins to fill with eggs they leave the cæcum and\r\n  travel through the colon to the rectum. The uterus is now packed with\r\n  eggs which contain a tadpole-shaped embryo. Egg-laying now takes\r\n  place, partly in the rectum, partly outside, the mode of exit being\r\n  not only passive through defecation but also an active one on the\r\n  part of the worms when the patient is in bed. In this case the worms\r\n  crawl out of the anus, producing a most intolerable itching as they\r\n  scatter their eggs between the nates and the perinæum. From here\r\n  in the case of girls they may get occasionally into the vulva and\r\n  vagina, and even into the oviducts and so into the body cavity. The\r\n  worms also may wander through the alimentary canal in the opposite\r\n  direction, getting out occasionally through the mouth. Recently a\r\n  _rôle_ has been assigned to them, as to other gut parasites, in\r\n  appendicitis and typhlitis.\r\n\r\n  It is stated that the males die after fertilizing the females,\r\n  thus explaining why they are so rarely met with in fæces [but\r\n  it is probable that they often escape notice from their small\r\n  size.--J. W. W. S.].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 345.--_A_, male, and _B_, female, of _Oxyuris\r\nvermicularis_. 5/1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 346.--On the left, female; on the right, male. _A_,\r\nanus; _M_, mouth; _V_, vulva. Greatly enlarged. (After Claus.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 347.--_Oxyuris vermicularis_: egg freshly\r\ndeposited, with tadpole-like embryo. × 640.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 348.--_Oxyuris vermicularis_: egg twelve hours\r\nafter deposition, with nematode-like embryo. × 640.]\r\n\r\n_Development._--The eggs, which often adhere together, contain a\r\ntadpole-like embryo, the thin tail of which is bent upwards ventrally;\r\nthe embryo in a short time, given a sufficiently high temperature,\r\npasses into a second folded nematode-like embryonal stage, lying in the\r\negg-shell, either in the fæces, with which also numerous females pass\r\nout, or in the moisture of the groove between the buttocks, and they\r\nthere await the opportunity of being reintroduced into man _per os_. It\r\nis very improbable that infection takes place directly in the large\r\nintestine, as is occasionally stated, because although the harbourers\r\nof Oxyuris are frequently liable to auto-infection, this takes place\r\nexclusively through the mouth, and is conveyed by the fingers, on which\r\nthe ova of Oxyuris, and occasionally the female worms, have clung.\r\n\r\n  The opportunity for this is afforded every evening, as naturally the\r\n  troublesome itching caused by the wandering of the worms is met by\r\n  scratching and rubbing with the fingers. It is therefore possible\r\n  that the eggs may even thus be introduced into the nose, where the\r\n  young Oxyuris are perhaps hatched out, if they get high enough up on\r\n  the moist pituitary mucous membrane. As a matter of fact, the larvæ\r\n  of Oxyuris have been found in the nose. Moreover, one can understand\r\n  that the eggs of Oxyuris are transferred from person to person by\r\n  the hand, directly or indirectly. This again explains the wholesale\r\n  infections which occur in collective dwellings, after a person\r\n  harbouring Oxyuris has been admitted into boarding-houses, etc. The\r\n  primary infection may be also caused in other ways--by foods, fruits,\r\n  vegetables and other articles that are eaten raw, and are polluted\r\n  with the ova. Perhaps also flies or their excrement play a part in\r\n  the distribution of the parasite, similar to that demonstrated by\r\n  Grassi as taking place in the spread of the ova of Trichocephalus and\r\n  Tænia.\r\n\r\nThe assumption of a _direct development_ without an intermediary host\r\nwas first substantiated by Leuckart by experiments on himself and\r\nthree of his students; about fourteen days after swallowing the eggs\r\nthe Oxyuris has attained 6 to 7 mm. in length; Grassi, and later on\r\nCalandruccio, infected themselves by swallowing adult female Oxyuris,\r\nwith the same results. Heller found worms in the gut (appendix\r\nvermiformis) of a male child five weeks old.\r\n\r\n  Other species are: _O. compar_ in the cat; _O. curvula_ and _O.\r\n  mastigodes_ in horse, ass, mule; _O. ambigua_ in the rabbit; _O.\r\n  poculum_ in the horse; _O. tenuicauda_ in the horse. Many species\r\n  occur in insects, especially in _Blattidæ_ and _Hydrophilidæ_\r\n  (aquatic beetles).\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Mermithidæ.*\r\n\r\nGenus. *Mermis*, Dujardin, 1845.\r\n\r\nWith characters of the family.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Mermis hominis oris*, Leidy, 1850.\r\n\r\nFourteen centimetres in length, 0·16 mm. in breadth; mouth terminal;\r\nposterior extremity obtuse and provided with a recurved hook 50 µ long.\r\n\r\n  The parasite was “obtained from the mouth of a child.” Stiles\r\n  considers it to be probably a Mermis, possibly swallowed in an apple.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Agamomermis*, Stiles, 1903.\r\n\r\nGroup name for immature _Mermithidæ_.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Agamomermis restiformis*, Leidy, 1880.\r\n\r\nThis worm measures 65 cm. in length, pointed anteriorly, the posterior\r\nextremity broadened and rounded off (1·5 mm. in breadth); the mouth is\r\nterminal, without lips. Behind the mouth six papillæ; the œsophagus\r\nmeasures 1·125 mm. in length; the intestine appears to terminate\r\nblindly.\r\n\r\n  This parasite was obtained in West Virginia from the urethra of a\r\n  young man, aged 20, who for a few days previous to expelling the worm\r\n  passed turbid and bloody urine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNIQUE.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION AND EXAMINATION OF FLUKES.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fixation._--(Method A.) (1) Place the flukes in a test tube or small\r\nbottle a quarter full of normal saline. Shake the contents _as hard as\r\npossible_ (the object of this is to _extend_ the flukes) for half a\r\nminute.\r\n\r\n(2) Add _immediately_ an equal bulk of saturated aqueous solution of\r\ncorrosive sublimate and shake again as vigorously as possible for a few\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n(3) Transfer when convenient to 70 per cent. alcohol. (Before staining\r\nand mounting remove the sublimate with tincture of iodine.)\r\n\r\n(Method B.) In case of large flukes, _e.g._, _Fasciola hepatica_,\r\n_Fasciolopsis buski_, compress the flukes between two glass slides with\r\nrubber bands or thread. Fix in sublimate or in absolute alcohol, or in\r\n10 per cent. formalin.\r\n\r\n(Method C.) Place the flukes in 10 per cent. formalin solution.\r\n\r\n_Staining_ is successfully effected by using quite _dilute_ solutions\r\nof carmine or hæmatein overnight. This is far preferable to using\r\nstrong solutions, as it may be almost impossible to remove a too\r\nintense stain. Almost any dilute carmine solution suffices. One of the\r\nbest is acetic-alum carmine (boil excess of carmine in a saturated\r\naqueous solution of potash-alum for about fifteen minutes; add glacial\r\nacetic acid to the extent of 10 per cent.; let it stand for a week;\r\nfilter). For use, dilute about thirty times with water. Place the\r\nflukes directly in the stain. Stain overnight or longer.\r\n\r\n_Differentiation._--In order to get the sharpest picture, it is best\r\nnow to differentiate (but this may often be omitted) with acid alcohol\r\n(70 per cent. alcohol 100 parts, HCl 5 drops). Allow to act from one\r\nto twenty-four hours, according to the appearance of the flukes.\r\nSimilarly, in staining with _hæmatoxylin_ solution, dilute twenty\r\nto thirty times so that the water is merely tinged with the stain.\r\nDifferentiate as before. After staining, dehydrate, clear, and mount in\r\nbalsam if required.\r\n\r\n_Clearing and Mounting._--(1) _Carbolic acid_ (carbolic acid 94,\r\nwater 6) is a very convenient clearing agent. It may be used for\r\nstained or unstained specimens. It will clear rapidly without previous\r\ndehydration. If it is required to mount a specimen permanently,\r\ntransfer from carbolic to alcohol, then cedar-wood oil (or xylol,\r\netc.), then balsam.\r\n\r\n(2) _Creasote._--Dehydrate the specimen, stained or unstained, transfer\r\nto creasote. If it is desired to mount permanently, transfer back to\r\nalcohol, then cedar-wood oil, then balsam.\r\n\r\n(3) _Cedar-wood Oil._--Preferable to xylol or oil of cloves. Dehydrate\r\nthe specimen in alcohol. To mount permanently, transfer to balsam.\r\n\r\n(4) _Glycerine._--_Vide_ under methods of preservation of ova; to mount\r\npermanently, transfer to glycerine jelly; subsequently to harden the\r\njelly, expose to formalin vapour.\r\n\r\nOf these media, carbolic acid has the greatest refractive index\r\nexcepting that of balsam. The latter may, in some cases, render\r\nstructures too transparent, and it may be advisable to use only\r\nglycerine or glycerine jelly.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF OVA IN FÆCES, URINE, BILE, ETC.\r\n\r\nHeat some 70 per cent. alcohol in a basin to about 60 to 70° C. (until\r\nbubbles begin to appear). Add the fæces, etc., in the proportion of one\r\npart to about nine of fixative; keep stirring. Allow the sediment to\r\nsettle. Transfer to a bottle with some fresh 70 per cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\n_Transference to Glycerine._--Prepare 5 per cent., 10 per cent., 20\r\nper cent. solutions of glycerine in 70 per cent. alcohol. Pour off\r\nthe alcohol in the bottle of fæces, etc., and replace by 5 per cent.\r\nglycerine solution. Allow to stand an hour or so. Then in the same way\r\nreplace the 5 per cent. by a 10 per cent. glycerine, and finally by a\r\n20 per cent. glycerine solution. When in this latter expose freely to\r\nthe air (protecting from dust), so as to allow the alcohol and water\r\nto evaporate. Add a few drops of glycerine from time to time till\r\neventually the ova are in pure glycerine. (In a very moist climate it\r\nmay be necessary to use lime or calcium chloride to dry the air.) To\r\nmount permanently transfer some of the sediment to glycerine jelly.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION AND EXAMINATION OF CESTODES.\r\n\r\n_Fixation._--(1) _Saturated aqueous corrosive sublimate._--Add to this\r\nglacial acetic acid to the extent of 1 per cent. (Note this fixative\r\nwill dissolve the “calcareous corpuscles”; 10 grammes of sublimate to\r\n160 c.c. of water will give a saturated solution.) Warm the fixative\r\nto 70° to 80° C. (Avoid the use of needles.) Use plenty of fixative.\r\nAllow to act for a quarter of an hour or so. (_a_) Transfer to 70 per\r\ncent. alcohol. (It is advisable to remove the sublimate by the use of\r\nLugol’s solution, or a solution containing tincture of iodine, adding\r\nthis until the iodine colour is permanent.) Or (_b_) transfer for\r\npreservation to 10 per cent. formalin.\r\n\r\nOr (2) 10 _per cent. formalin_.--In order to prevent contraction it is\r\nadvisable to extend the tapeworm and keep it fixed by glass plates, or\r\nwind the worm around a wide glass tube or bottle, and then fix it.\r\n\r\nOr (3) _fix in hot alcohol_.\r\n\r\n_Staining._--As under flukes. It is necessary to sacrifice portions of\r\nthe tapeworm for this purpose, cutting out, _e.g._, mature segments, so\r\nas to study the topography of the genitalia.\r\n\r\n_Clearing._--As under flukes. To examine the hooks satisfactorily it is\r\nbest to cut off the head with a sharp knife and mount. A certain amount\r\nof pressure is then advisable in order to view the hooks completely so\r\nas to measure them.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF OVA IN FÆCES, ETC.\r\n\r\nAs under flukes.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION AND EXAMINATION OF NEMATODES.\r\n\r\n_Fixation._--(1) Thoroughly wash the worms to get rid of mucus, etc.,\r\nby shaking up in warm saline (or water) till the washings are clean.\r\nThen transfer to 70 per cent. alcohol _heated_ to about 70° C. It is\r\nabsolutely necessary to use _hot_ fixatives in order to _extend_ the\r\nworms. If no alcohol or spirit is immediately available, drop the worms\r\ninto _hot_ water, or saline, and transfer later to 70 per cent. alcohol.\r\n\r\n(2) Drop into hot 10 per cent. formalin.\r\n\r\n_Clearing._--(1) Carbolic acid, _vide_ p. 471.\r\n\r\n(2) Creasote, _vide_ p. 471.\r\n\r\n(3) Glycerine, _vide_ p. 472.\r\n\r\n_Staining._--In case of quite small Nematodes, _e.g._, _Anguillulidæ_,\r\ncarmine may be used, but as a rule staining is not advantageous.\r\n\r\n_Rolling._--In order to study the mouth parts, or bursa, etc., it is\r\nnecessary to place the worm in any desired position. This is done as\r\none would roll a penholder along the table by one’s finger placed on\r\ntop of it. In the case of a worm, one edge of the cover-glass is placed\r\nover the worm, the other is supported by a strip of cardboard. By\r\ntapping the cover-glass the worm will now revolve as much as required\r\nprovided it is _round_ and _straight_. In certain cases it may be\r\nnecessary for this purpose to cut off the head or tail. Roll these\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\nWhen a suitable position is got, the worm may be fixed in this position\r\nby pressure on the cover-glass, so as slightly to flatten it.\r\n\r\n_Mounting the Head._--If it is required to get an end view, it is\r\nnecessary to cut off the head transversely as near the end as possible,\r\nand then mount.\r\n\r\n_Detection of Eggs_ (Bass and Hall).--Mix the fæces thoroughly with\r\nten times the volume of water. Filter through gauze. Centrifugalize\r\nthe filtrate. Wash the sediment and centrifugalize. Repeat twice.\r\nTo sediment add CaCl_{2} solution, sp. gr. 1250. The eggs float\r\nto surface. Pour off surface fluid. Dilute to sp. gr. 1050.\r\nCentrifugalize. Examine sediment, which contains practically all the\r\neggs in the stool.\r\n\r\n_Detection of Small Nematodes._--Mix the fæces thoroughly with water.\r\nAllow to settle for five minutes. Carefully decant off, or better,\r\nsyphon off the fluid. Mix the sediment again with water. Allow to\r\nsettle. Remove the fluid. Repeat several times. Examine the sediment\r\nin a Petri dish. As the fluid is poured off, the worms will be seen\r\ncollected in the backwater. Remove them with a brush. Fix in hot 70 per\r\ncent. alcohol.\r\n\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION OF LARVAL FORMS OF ANCYLOSTOMA AND STRONGYLOIDES.\r\n\r\nA modification of the second method of Looss (p. 455) is that of\r\nFülleborn. A glass filter funnel is lined with linen or with cotton\r\nwool dyed black with iron-tannin. On this is placed a layer of sterile\r\nsand, and on top of this the fæces. The whole is moistened. The larvæ\r\nhatch out and wander through the meshes of the wool, appearing on the\r\nedges of the same as white threads visible to the naked eye. With a\r\nplatinum needle these can be easily removed. The glass filter can\r\nbe placed on a glass cylinder, and this in another large stoppered\r\ncylinder containing caustic potash solution at the bottom, so that any\r\nlarvæ escaping from the funnel are killed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nD. *ACANTHOCEPHALA*, Rud.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Gutless, nematode-like worms that carry at their anterior end a\r\n  retractile rostrum beset with hooks. In their adult condition they\r\n  only live in vertebrate animals. During their larval stage they are\r\n  often parasitic in invertebrate animals.\r\n\r\n  The _Acanthocephala_ are elongated cylindrical worms, with a\r\n  rounded posterior end. In some species an annulation is distinctly\r\n  recognizable; they are, however, not segmented. The size varies\r\n  according to the species, between about 5 to 10 mm. and 40 to 50 cm.;\r\n  in general, however, there is a preponderance of the small species.\r\n  The sexes are separate, and the males can easily be distinguished\r\n  from the females without examination of the genitalia, as the females\r\n  are both larger and thicker.\r\n\r\n  The body wall of Echinorhynchus is limited by a thin cuticle, which\r\n  is attached inwardly to the hypodermis. In only exceptional cases\r\n  a syncytium with large nuclei, even in the adult condition, is\r\n  represented by the hypodermis; and in it fibre systems, the elements\r\n  of which run in layers in various directions, appear, and it is only\r\n  towards the interior from these strata of fibres that the nuclei of\r\n  the hypodermis are found. As a rule, these fibres, at all events\r\n  the radiary fibres, are regarded as muscles. Hamann describes them\r\n  as elastic fibres, which lie in a viscid gelatinous connective\r\n  substance (transformed protoplasm?); a lacune system filled with\r\n  a granular fluid, the central part of which are two longitudinal\r\n  lacunes lying at the sides, also belongs to the cutaneous strata, as\r\n  do the so-called lemnisci, two short, flat organs suspended in the\r\n  body cavity, and the pedicles of which are attached anteriorly at the\r\n  border between the rostrum and body; their structure as well as their\r\n  origin permit them to be traced to the skin (fig. 348A).\r\n\r\n  Finally, inwardly below the skin there follows a layer of annular,\r\n  and after these a layer of longitudinal muscles, the structure\r\n  cells of which remain present in the residues, carrying nuclei. The\r\n  motor apparatus of the rostrum, the sheath of the rostrum, and the\r\n  lemnisci also belong to the muscular system. The rostrum represents a\r\n  finger-shaped hollow process of the cutaneous layer; but, according\r\n  to Hamann, it originates from the entoderm and passes through the\r\n  skin secondarily. It is covered by a thin cuticle, and as a rule\r\n  contains a large number of regularly placed chitinous hooks that\r\n  adjoin a granular formation tissue. From the base of the rostrum\r\n  springs a tubular hollow muscle extending into the body cavity; this\r\n  is the RECEPTACULUM PROBOSCIDIS, from the base of which again bundles\r\n  of longitudinal muscles originate, which pass along its axis and\r\n  that of the rostrum itself, and are inserted at the inner surface of\r\n  its anterior end (RETRACTOR PROBOSCIDIS). These muscles when they\r\n  contract invaginate the proboscis and draw it into the receptaculum;\r\n  when reversed they act again as PROTRUSOR PROBOSCIDIS. The whole of\r\n  the anterior body, however, can be invaginated, and for this purpose\r\n  there is a muscle that originates from the body wall at a variable\r\n  distance back, and which is joined to the receptaculum (RETRACTOR\r\n  RECEPTACULI); there is also a bell-shaped muscle which springs from\r\n  the body wall behind the lemnisci in rings, and passes forward to the\r\n  spot of attachment of the lemnisci.\r\n\r\n  The nervous system consists of a cluster of ganglia situated at the\r\n  base of the rostrum, from which three nerves pass towards the front\r\n  and two towards the back. No sensory organs are known.\r\n\r\n  The excretory organs, according to Kaiser, lie at the upper border of\r\n  the ductus ejaculatorius in the male and at the so-called bell in the\r\n  female. Here they represent the long-known villous tufts, placed on\r\n  disc-like cushions. In each of the cylindrical villi--which terminate\r\n  blindly towards the body cavity--there lies a cilium, which springs\r\n  from the membrane lining the villus, and which lies in a space cavity\r\n  of the villus, which ultimately proceeds as a little canal. There are\r\n  three canals discharging into the uterus that serve to conduct the\r\n  excretory materials from the body cavity; special glandular cells\r\n  corresponding to the terminal cells of the Platyhelminths, at the\r\n  commencement of the system, are not present in the Acanthocephala.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEXUAL ORGANS.\r\n\r\n  (_a_) _Male Organs._--The greatest part of the male genital apparatus\r\n  is contained in a muscular sheath--the ligament--which originates\r\n  at the posterior end of the receptaculum proboscidis, passes along\r\n  longitudinally through the body cavity, and is inserted at the\r\n  posterior end of the worm. The two oval testicles usually lie one\r\n  behind the other; their vasa efferentia unite sooner or later into a\r\n  vas deferens which passes backwards, and finally terminates in the\r\n  penis; the terminal portion of the conducting apparatus is surrounded\r\n  by six large glandular cells (prostatic glands) the excretory ducts\r\n  of which open into the vas deferens. The penis itself is placed at\r\n  the base of a bell-shaped invagination of the posterior end, the\r\n  bursa, which is everted during copulation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 348A.--The male of _Echinorhynchus augustatus_.\r\n_L._, lemnisci; _T._, testicles; _P._, prostatic glands; _P.r._, sheath\r\nof proboscis, with ganglion; _R.r._, retractor of sheath of proboscis.\r\n25/1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 348B.--Anterior portion of the female apparatus of\r\n_Echinorhynchus acus_. On the left seen from behind, on the right seen\r\nfrom the front. _F_, inferior orifice of the bell; _B_, bell; _Lig_,\r\nligament; _M_, mouth of bell; _Ut_, uterus. Magnified. (After Wagener.)]\r\n\r\n  (_b_) _Female Organs._--There are only two ovaries present in the\r\n  ligament during the larval stage. During the course of growth they\r\n  divide into accumulations of cells (placentulæ, loose or floating\r\n  ovaries), which finally cause the ligament to burst and they thus\r\n  attain the body cavity. Thence a peculiarly constructed apparatus\r\n  finally conveys the eggs out. This apparatus consists of the uterine\r\n  bell and vagina, the latter discharging at the posterior extremity\r\n  of the body. The bell is a muscular canal provided with apertures at\r\n  both the anterior and posterior extremities. Its interior space is in\r\n  direct communication with the body cavity, and the anterior orifice\r\n  takes up all materials floating in the cavity--egg-balls, mature and\r\n  immature eggs--and pushes these further backwards. The continuation\r\n  of the bell lumen is now narrowed by a number of large cells in such\r\n  a manner that only bodies of a certain form can pass through this\r\n  tract and attain the uterus; everything else is conveyed back into\r\n  the body cavity through the posterior opening of the bell.\r\n\r\n  The eggs are already fertilized in the body cavity, and in this\r\n  position go through their development to the formation of the embryo.\r\n  Completely developed eggs are surrounded by three shells, and are\r\n  generally fusiform. The eggs agglomerate in masses in the uterus\r\n  until they are finally deposited through the vagina and vulva.\r\n  For the further development, the transmission of the eggs into an\r\n  intermediary host--usually a crustacean or an insect--is necessary;\r\n  the metamorphosis is very complicated; but this transmission may be\r\n  very easily effected artificially by feeding suitable crustaceans\r\n  (_Asellus_, _Gammarus_, etc.) with the eggs of _Acanthocephala_; this\r\n  being the only method of inducing the larva to hatch out so that\r\n  its structure may be studied. The larva appears in the form of an\r\n  elongated, somewhat bent body, at the stumpy anterior end of which\r\n  there is a crown of hooks or spines, whereas the posterior end is\r\n  pointed. Especial retractors draw in the hook-beset anterior surface,\r\n  and an elastic cushion beneath them jerks them forward again when\r\n  required. In the middle of the body a roundish heap of small cells is\r\n  seen, from which the entire body of the Echinorhynchus originates,\r\n  even to the cutaneous layer; the latter is also the larval skin in\r\n  which the small Echinorhynchus gradually grows. The development of\r\n  all the organs takes place within the intermediary host, and the\r\n  parasite only needs to be imported into the terminal host to attain\r\n  the adult stage after a certain growth. In some cases, however, a\r\n  second intermediary host is utilized.\r\n\r\n  Species of _Acanthocephala_ only occur exceptionally in human beings.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Echinorhynchus gigas*, Goeze, 1782.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Tænia hirudinacea_, Pallas, 1781.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 348C.--Egg of _Echinorhynchus gigas_. 300/1. (After\r\nLeuckart.)]\r\n\r\n  The body is elongated, gradually decreasing in thickness towards the\r\n  back. The rostrum is almost spherical, and is beset with five or six\r\n  rows of recurved hooks. The males measure 10 to 15 cm. in length,\r\n  the females 30 to 50 cm.; the eggs are provided with three shells,\r\n  of which the middle one is the thickest. The eggs measure 0·08 to\r\n  0.1 mm. in length. The GIANT ECHINORHYNCHUS occurs especially in the\r\n  intestinal canal of the domestic pig; it is less common in other\r\n  mammals. It bores deep into the mucous membrane with its rostrum,\r\n  and causes an annular proliferation around the perforated spot;\r\n  occasionally also it causes perforation of the intestine.\r\n\r\n  It is doubtful whether the giant Echinorhynchus occurs in man.\r\n  Leuckart admitted that there were a few positive cases. According\r\n  to Lindemann, _Ech. gigas_ occurs in human beings in South Russia,\r\n  and its presence is not rare. This statement, however, has not been\r\n  confirmed. Its presence in man is by no means impossible, as its\r\n  intermediary host, the cankerworm, or cock-chafer (_Melolontha_),\r\n  is, according to Schneider, occasionally eaten raw by human\r\n  beings. According to Kaiser, the golden beetle (_Cetonia aurata_)\r\n  and, according to Stiles, another beetle in America (_Lachnosterna\r\n  arcuata_) are also intermediary hosts.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Echinorhynchus hominis*, Lambl, 1859.\r\n\r\n  This term is applied to an ECHINORHYNCHUS found by Lambl in the\r\n  intestine of a boy who had died of _leucæmia_; the worm was 5·6 mm.\r\n  in length, and the almost spherical head was beset with twelve\r\n  transverse rows of hooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Echinorhynchus moniliformis*, Bremser, 1819.\r\n\r\n  The male is 4 cm. in length, the female 8 cm. long. This species\r\n  lives in the intestine of field-mice, rats, marmots and _Myoxus\r\n  quercinius_. A beetle (_Blaps mucronata_) is the intermediary host.\r\n\r\n  This species has also once been artificially cultivated in man\r\n  (Grassi and Calandruccio).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nE. *GORDIIDAE.*\r\n\r\n\r\n  Very long thin worms similar to Filariæ, which, in their adult\r\n  condition, live free in brooks, pools and springs; the mouth and the\r\n  commencement of the intestine are obliterated; there are no lateral\r\n  ridges, and the muscular system presents a structure different to\r\n  that of the _Nematoda_. The posterior end of the male is split, and\r\n  spicules are lacking; there are two testicles. In both sexes the\r\n  genitalia discharge through the terminal gut.\r\n\r\n  The larvæ, which carry a rostrum beset with hooks, force themselves\r\n  into the larvæ of water-insects; more rarely they invade molluscs,\r\n  and they then become encysted within the body of the host. According\r\n  to Villot, at least a part of them attain the intestine of fishes,\r\n  where they again become encysted, and after a period of rest they\r\n  travel into the tissues of their hosts, and finally again reach the\r\n  exterior by way of the intestine, where they then become adult. In\r\n  most cases, however, the gordius larvæ are taken up by predacious\r\n  water insects; they live for a while in the body cavity of these\r\n  insects, undergo a metamorphosis, and finally wander into the water.\r\n\r\n  A few species invade man accidentally with water, in which case they\r\n  are usually vomited up:--\r\n\r\n  _Gordius aquaticus_, Dujardin, 30 to 90 cm. in length (Aldrovandi,\r\n  Degland, Siebold, Patruban).\r\n\r\n  _Gordius tolosanus_, Duj., 11 to 13 cm. in length (Fiori).\r\n\r\n  _Gordius varius_, Leidy, 10 to 16 cm., female, up to 30 cm. in length\r\n  (Diesing).\r\n\r\n  _Gordius chilensis_, Blanch. (Guy). _Gordius villoti_, Rosa\r\n  (Bercutti, Camerano); _Gordius tricuspidatus_, L. Def. (R.\r\n  Blanchard), _Gordius violaceus_, Baird (Topsent), and _Gordius\r\n  pustulosus_, Baird (Parona).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nF. *HIRUDINEA s. DISCOPHORA* (Leech).\r\n\r\n\r\n  The _Hirudinea_, which have been appropriately included amongst the\r\n  Annelida, differ in many respects from the typical members of the\r\n  group; their body is long and flat, it lacks the parapodia that\r\n  are characteristic to all forms of Annelida; but, on the other\r\n  hand, possesses a terminal posterior sucker, and in many species\r\n  there is also an anterior sucker. The mouth is terminal at the\r\n  anterior end, the anus lies dorsally above the posterior sucker\r\n  (fig. 348D). The body is segmented, but this is less manifest in\r\n  the body covering than it is in the arrangement of the internal\r\n  organs; the segmentation, nevertheless, is also indicated exteriorly\r\n  by the appearance of the cutaneous sensory organs which correspond\r\n  to the segments. This shows what the condition of the ganglia in\r\n  the abdominal ganglion chain has taught us, that the anterior and\r\n  the most posterior segments are considerably abbreviated--a part of\r\n  the latter taking part in the formation of the suctorial organs.\r\n  In a great many species the skin is distinctly annulated, four or\r\n  five of such rings, at least in the central region of the body,\r\n  appearing on one segment of the body. The condition of their body\r\n  cavity is another peculiarity of the _Hirudinea_; it is narrowed by\r\n  the powerful development of the connective tissue and the muscular\r\n  system into four tubular sinuses, which have the appearance of\r\n  blood-vessels. There are usually one dorsal and one ventral median\r\n  trunks, as well as two lateral trunks; in addition, a particular\r\n  blood-vessel system exists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 348D.--The internal organs of the leech. The\r\ncreature has been opened from the dorsal surface, and part of the\r\nintestine has been removed. The testicles, with vas deferens, may be\r\nseen between the blind ducts of the intestine; beyond these on either\r\nside the segmental organs. The female genital organs are in front of\r\nthe most anterior pair of testicles. (After Kennel.)]\r\n\r\n  The skin consists of a very thin cuticle that is cast off from time\r\n  to time; it is secreted by the underlying cylindrical epithelium,\r\n  which contains numerous goblet cells. The muscular system is\r\n  strongly developed; it consists of long tubular fibres, which run\r\n  circularly, longitudinally and in the dorso-ventral direction; the\r\n  muscular system is subject to a particular expansion in the clinging\r\n  organs and at the commencement of the intestine. On the whole, the\r\n  alimentary canal represents a tube running straight from the mouth to\r\n  the anus, which possesses a number of blind sac-like protuberances\r\n  at the sides varying according to the species. The most anterior\r\n  section, the pharynx, in the leeches with maxillæ carries three\r\n  chitinous, semicircular plates furnished with teeth--the jaws--which\r\n  serve to tear up the epidermis in order to open the blood-vessels;\r\n  in the leeches with rostra a long protractile proboscis rises from\r\n  the base of the elongated pharynx. Numerous salivary glands, the\r\n  secretion from which possesses toxic properties, discharge into\r\n  the pharynx. The œsophagus, which follows the pharynx, and to the\r\n  exterior of which numerous radiary muscles are fixed, is a suctorial\r\n  organ in its entire structure. The nutriment in the larger species\r\n  consists of the blood of vertebrate animals, in smaller species and\r\n  in the young stages the food consists of small invertebrate animals.\r\n\r\n  The NERVOUS SYSTEM exhibits the typical structure of other segmented\r\n  worms; the sensory organs consist of the previously mentioned\r\n  goblet-shaped cutaneous sensory organs, of the organs of taste, and\r\n  of eyes, the latter frequently being present in large numbers.\r\n\r\n  The EXCRETORY or segmental organs exhibit many peculiarities, which\r\n  cannot, however, be detailed here. They commence with funnels in the\r\n  lacunes of the body cavity, and usually discharge on the ventral\r\n  surface.\r\n\r\n  Almost all the _Hirudinea_ are hermaphrodite and copulate\r\n  reciprocally. The two ovaries are very small, and the oviducts that\r\n  proceed from them soon unite into a common duct, which then passes\r\n  into the uterus and discharges through the short vagina in the\r\n  median line of the ventral surface behind the male organs into the\r\n  so-called clitellar region. The male sexual apparatus consists of\r\n  symmetrically arranged testicles, varying in number according to the\r\n  species, the short vasa efferentia of which, one by one, run into the\r\n  vas deferens, passing towards the front on each side. In front, at\r\n  about the level, or a little in front, of the female genitalia, the\r\n  two vessels pass into a convoluted mass of tubes to the so-called\r\n  epididymis, and then discharge into the single protractile penis\r\n  (fig. 348D).\r\n\r\n  All leeches deposit so-called COCOONS. These are small barrel-shaped\r\n  or pouch-like bodies, which are surrounded by a thicker shell and\r\n  contain a number of eggs in a large mass of albumen; the albumen\r\n  originates from glands of the generative organs, the shell substance\r\n  from cutaneous glands of the clitellar region.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Gnathobdellidæ* (Leeches with Jaws).\r\n\r\n  These are distinguished by the possession of usually three jaws in\r\n  the pharynx; the body consists of twenty-six segments. The posterior\r\n  sucker is large and flat; the anterior sucker is smaller. The\r\n  _Hirudinea_ have five pairs of eyes, the _Nephelinæ_ have four pairs.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Hirudo*, L., 1758.\r\n\r\n  The entire body consists of 102 annulations, five appearing on one\r\n  segment in the central region of the body. The pharynx has three\r\n  semicircular jaws, the arched border of which is beset with numerous\r\n  teeth (50 to 100). The male sexual orifice lies between the thirtieth\r\n  and thirty-first rings, the female orifice between the thirty-fifth\r\n  and thirty-sixth. There are numerous species, some of which are\r\n  utilized for medicinal purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Hirudo medicinalis*, L., 1758.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 348E.--_Hirudo medicinalis._ _a_, anterior end,\r\nwith open buccal cavity, with the jaws, _J_, at the; _b_, one jaw\r\nisolated. (After Claus.)]\r\n\r\n  It occurs in numerous colour varieties, one of which has been\r\n  designated _Hirudo officinalis_, Moq.-Tandon. Usually the dorsal\r\n  surface is greyish-green and is marked with six rusty-red\r\n  longitudinal stripes. The ventral surface is olive-green, more\r\n  or less spotted with black, and marked at the sides with a black\r\n  longitudinal line. The length averages 8 to 12 to 20 cm. This leech\r\n  lives in swamps, ponds and brooks, overgrown with plants and having\r\n  a muddy bed. The cocoons are deposited in the soil at the sides.\r\n  Europe, as well as North Africa, is its home. At the present day it\r\n  has been exterminated from most parts of Central Europe, but it is\r\n  still very common in Hungary. Its use for medicinal purposes is well\r\n  known. A large leech can suck about 15 grs. of blood, and about the\r\n  same amount is lost through secondary hæmorrhage.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Hirudo troctina*, Johnston, 1816.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Hirudo interrupta_, Moq.-Tandon, 1826.\r\n\r\n  This species measures 8 to 10 cm. in length. The back is greenish,\r\n  with six rows of black spots surrounded by red; the lateral borders\r\n  are orange-coloured; the abdomen spotted or unspotted. Its habitat is\r\n  in North Africa and Sardinia. It is applied medicinally in England,\r\n  Spain, France, Algeria, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Limnatis*, Moq.-Tandon, 1826.\r\n\r\n  Nearly related to Hirudo, but is differentiated by a longitudinal\r\n  groove on the inner surface of the upper lip of the anterior sucker.\r\n  The jaws are furnished with over 100 very sharp toothlets.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Limnatis nilotica*, Savigny, 1820.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Bdella nilotica_, Sav.; _L. nilotica_, Moq.-Tandon; _Hæmopis_\r\n  (_vorax_), Moq.-Tandon, 1826, _p. p._; _Hæmopis sanguisuga_,\r\n  Moq.-Tandon, 1846 (_nec Hir. sanguis_, Bergm., 1757).\r\n\r\n  This species measures 8 to 10 cm. in length, and becomes gradually\r\n  more pointed towards the front; the body is always soft. The back is\r\n  brown or greenish, and has usually six longitudinal rows (rarely only\r\n  two or four) of black dots. The abdomen is dark; but numerous colour\r\n  variations occur.\r\n\r\n  The native place is North Africa, especially the coastal regions; it\r\n  is also found in the Canaries, the Azores, Syria, Armenia, Turkestan,\r\n  perhaps also Southern Europe. It is taken into the mouth with\r\n  drinking water, and may settle in the pharynx, larynx, œsophagus, and\r\n  nasal cavities of human beings. This species has also been observed\r\n  in the vagina and on the conjunctiva. It is equally fond of attacking\r\n  domestic animals.\r\n\r\n  _Hirudo mysomelas_ (Senegambia) and _Hirudo granulosa_ (India) are\r\n  placed with this genus, and, like our leech, are also used for\r\n  medicinal purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Hæmadipsa*, Tennent, 1861.\r\n\r\n  These leeches live on land, and measure 2 to 3 cm. in length. About a\r\n  dozen species are known. They are a veritable scourge to persons in\r\n  the tropics (Asia, South America), as they attack them to suck their\r\n  blood. They are able to force their way even under close-fitting\r\n  garments, so that it is difficult to protect oneself from their\r\n  assaults (_Hæmadipsa ceylonica_, Bl., and other species).\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Rhynchobdellidæ* (Leeches with Rostrum).\r\n\r\n  These are furnished with a proboscis in lieu of the jaws; the segment\r\n  consists of three annulations.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Hæmentaria*, de Filippi, 1849.\r\n\r\n*Hæmentaria officinalis*, de Fil.\r\n\r\n  Inhabit Mexico, where they are used for medicinal purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Placobdella*, R. Blanch.\r\n\r\n*Placobdella catenigera*, Moq.-Tandon.\r\n\r\n  Indigenous to South Russia, Hungary, Italy and South France. It is a\r\n  parasite of the swamp turtle, but frequently attacks human beings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nG. *ARTHROPODA* (Jointed-limbed Animals).\r\n\r\nBY\r\n\r\nFRED. V. THEOBALD, M.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n  BILATERALLY symmetrical segmented animals which are covered with a\r\n  thick cuticle that is frequently calcareous (_Crustacea_), but always\r\n  thinner between the segments; they carry (primitively) a pair of\r\n  jointed appendages on every segment.[321] The segments of the body\r\n  are uniform in certain regions, but differ from those of contiguous\r\n  regions, so that it is easy to distinguish three parts (head, thorax\r\n  and abdomen), each composed of segments. The cephalic segments are\r\n  always formed into a uniform head, the segmentation being scarcely\r\n  recognizable at either end; the thoracic segments may also fuse, or\r\n  part or all of them may coalesce with the head; the abdomen, as a\r\n  rule, retains its segmentation, but this may possibly also be lost,\r\n  in which case it is [sometimes] united to the cephalothorax. The\r\n  structure of the three regions depends mostly on the varying form\r\n  and function of the appendages: those on the head are primitively\r\n  locomotive organs (and frequently are still so in the early stages),\r\n  but they become transformed into feelers and mouth-parts (mandibles,\r\n  maxillæ); the limbs of the thorax, however, usually retain their\r\n  ambulatory functions, as frequently do those of the abdomen;\r\n  sometimes, however, the abdominal limbs disappear, entirely or\r\n  partly; in the latter case they are then utilized for other purposes.\r\n\r\n[321] [In most _Arthropoda_ the skin is hardened by a deposit of chitin\r\n(_Hexapoda_, etc.).--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n  In their organization the _Arthropoda_ approach the segmented worms.\r\n\r\n  The _Arthropoda_ are generally divided into five groups\r\n  (_Crustacea_,[322] _Protracheata_, _Arachnoidea_, _Myriapoda_,[323]\r\n  and _Insecta_ or _Hexapoda_), of which only the _Arachnoidea_ and the\r\n  _Hexapoda_ interest us here.\r\n\r\n[322] Parasitic or free-living Crustaceans may now and then invade man\r\nabnormally. Thus, according to Betten, _Caligus curtus_ invade the\r\ncornea (Betten, R. A., “Par. Crust. as a Foreign Body on the Cornea,”\r\n_Lancet_, 1900, i, p. 1002; and _Centralbl. f. Bakt. u. Par._, xxix,\r\np. 506). According to Laboulbène, also _Gammarus pulex_ (Laboulbène,\r\nA., “Obs. d’accid. caus. par le _G. pul._ apport. avec l’eau de boison\r\ndans l’estomac d’un homme,” _Bull. Acad. méd._, 1898, p. 21).\r\n\r\n[323] R. Blanchard has compiled thirty-five cases in which _Myriapoda_\r\nhave been observed in the intestine as well as in the nose of human\r\nbeings (“Sur le pseudopar. d. myriap. chez l’homme,” _Arch. de Par._,\r\n1898, i, p. 452). E. Munoz Ramos reports an additional case (_ibid._,\r\np. 491). A few years ago a doctor in East Prussia sent me a rain\r\nworm out of a lady’s nose (_cf._ Hanau, A., “Wahrsch. Pseudo-paras.\r\nv. Schmeissfliegenlarv. u. angebl. Paras. v. Regenwürmern b. einer\r\nHysterischen,” _Arch. de Par._, 1899, ii, p. 23).\r\n\r\n\r\n_A._ *ARACHNOIDEA* (Spiders, Mites, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe head and thorax are always united together; the abdomen is either\r\nsegmented or without exterior segmentation, in which case it is united\r\nwith the cephalothorax.[324] The number of pairs of appendages amount\r\nto six, of which the two front pairs, the cheliceræ and the pedipalpi,\r\nare attached to the head region and the four remaining pairs to the\r\nthoracic region.[325] The abdomen in the adult condition has no\r\nappendages. The Arachnoids are air-breathers, and for this purpose\r\nare either provided with tracheæ or with so-called lung-sacs, or they\r\nbreathe through the surface of the body. Some aquatic forms breathe by\r\ngills.\r\n\r\n[324] [This is only so in the _Acarina_ or mites, not in the _Araneida_\r\nor spiders.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n[325] [The true character of the _Arachnoidea_ is the presence of\r\nfour pairs of ambulatory appendages. This number is reduced to two\r\npairs in the gall-making _Phytoptidæ_, and they differ from all other\r\n_Arthropoda_ in having no antennæ.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\nThere are eight or ten orders of Arachnoids,[326] of which, however,\r\nonly two, the _Acarina_ and the _Linguatulida_, have to be considered\r\nhere.[327]\r\n\r\n[326] Twelve orders are now recognized, as follows: _Pentastomida_\r\nor Linguatulids; _Tardigrada_ or bear-animalcules; _Phalangidæ_ or\r\nharvest-men; _Acarina_ or ticks and mites; _Palpigradi_; _Solifugæ_;\r\n_Pseudoscorpionidea_ or book mites; _Pedipalpi_ or false scorpions;\r\n_Scorpionidea_ or true scorpions; _Araneida_ or spiders; _Xiphosura_ or\r\nking crabs; and _Pycnogonida_, marine Arachnoids.\r\n\r\n[327] _Chelifer cancroides_ has also been observed as a pseudoparasite\r\nin man (Arnault de Very, S., “Pseudopar. du. _Chel. cancr._ chez\r\nl’homme,” _Compt. rend. Soc. de Biol._, 1901, liii, p. 105).\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder. *Acarina* (Mites).\r\n\r\n  Small Arachnoids, the three parts of the body of which are, as a\r\n  rule, coalesced; it is only rarely that a faint line indicates the\r\n  division between a cephalothorax and abdomen. The two appendages\r\n  on the head are designed for biting or puncturing and sucking, and\r\n  vary according to their use. The cheliceræ[328] are fang-like jaws\r\n  or puncturing bristles forming a kind of rostrum, the pedipalpi are\r\n  claw-like or shear-shaped, or form a suctorial proboscis.[329] The\r\n  four pairs of legs are usually well developed, more rarely they\r\n  are rudimentary or have partly vanished; many parasitic forms are\r\n  provided with pedunculated suckers [ambulacra--F. V. T.]. Respiratory\r\n  organs (tracheal tufts) may be present or absent. The nervous system\r\n  is reduced to a minimum, eyes are usually lacking. The intestine,\r\n  situated in the central part, generally has three blind appendages;\r\n  the anus is situated on the venter above the posterior end. Sexes\r\n  separated; nearly all the species deposit eggs, from which six-legged\r\n  larvæ hatch. The _Acarina_ live either free in the water or in moist\r\n  soil, or they are parasitic on plants and animals.[330]\r\n\r\n[328] [The cheliceræ are sometimes regarded as modified antennæ, but it\r\nis more natural to regard them as the morphological equivalent of the\r\nmandibles of _Hexapoda_.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n[329] [The pedipalpi, or second pair of jaws, consist of a stout\r\nbasal segment and a palp, which may have the appearance of a leg in\r\n_Arachnida_; this may end with or without a claw, or with a chela\r\n(scorpions); they may also form a tube enclosing the styliform\r\ncheliceræ (mites).--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n[330] [_Acarina_ are also found living upon trees, feeding upon other\r\nArthropods and also upon spores of lichen and fungi (_Oribatidæ_ or\r\nbeetle mites); they also swarm indoors amongst stores and provisions\r\n(_Tyroglyphidæ_ and _Glyciphagi_, household, sugar and cheese mites).\r\nThis order is very important, as many are parasites upon man, his\r\ndomestic animals and his cultivated plants, and attack his provisions\r\nand stores. Some live on blood, and in some of the ticks distribute\r\nvarious protozoal and other blood parasites and germs.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Trombidiidæ* (Running Mites).\r\n\r\n  Soft-skinned _Acarina_ with tracheæ and with two eyes, usually\r\n  pedunculated; they are often brightly coloured; cheliceræ lancet- or\r\n  claw-shaped; pedipalpi claw-like; legs composed of six segments, with\r\n  suctorial discs between the terminal ungues.[331] Larvæ six-legged.\r\n  To the latter belong the larvæ of several species of Trombidium such\r\n  as:--\r\n\r\n[331] [Some have seven segments to the legs.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Trombidium*, Latreille (and *Leptus*).\r\n\r\n*Leptus autumnalis*, Shaw, 1790.\r\n\r\nLeptus occur as parasites in the human skin and cause a cutaneous\r\ndisease known as autumn erythema, and produce a very unpleasant\r\nsensation on account of the troublesome itching; in children it is very\r\noften accompanied by fever.[332]\r\n\r\n[332] [This minute parasite is especially obnoxious in barley fields.\r\nIn walking over barley stubble one is sure to be attacked by this\r\nAcarus in many districts. Trombidium is often very prevalent in\r\ngardens, especially along rows of peas, and in spring they may be found\r\non fruit trees and bushes. Nut-pickers are frequently attacked by\r\nLeptus, and also pickers in other fruit plantations. It is often called\r\nthe harvest mite.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 349.--_Leptus autumnalis_, with so-called sucking\r\nproboscis. Enlarged. (After Gudden.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 350.--_Leptus autumnalis_: the so-called proboscis\r\nis formed around the hypopharynx sunk into the skin. 100/1. (After\r\nTrouessart.)]\r\n\r\n  Formerly these mites were considered adult forms, but when they were\r\n  recognized as mite larvæ they were taken for those of the spider-mite\r\n  (_Tetranychus telarius_); the investigations of Hanstein, however,\r\n  showed this to be a mistake. When Henking first investigated the\r\n  development of _Trombidium fuliginosum_, parasitic in the larval\r\n  stage on vine-fretters, he demonstrated the occurrence of a form\r\n  very similar to _Leptus autumnalis_, and the “autumn, grass, or\r\n  gooseberry” louse was commonly designated the Trombidium larva. Even\r\n  before Henking’s work it had been described by Mégnin as the larva\r\n  of _Trombidium holosericeum_, a red-coloured species, frequently\r\n  occurring in spring and summer on the ground, trees, etc. This\r\n  assumption, however, as Moniez was the first to explain, is not\r\n  correct; indeed, as many as three species come under consideration:\r\n  _T. gymnopterosum_, L., _T. fuliginosum_, Herm. (according to\r\n  Brucker), and two species known hitherto only in the early stage, _T.\r\n  striaticeps_, Helm. et Oudem., and _T. poriceps_, Helm. et Oudem.,\r\n  which are not only parasitic on mammals, but on birds, on Arthropods\r\n  and especially on insects. Arthropods appear to be the normal hosts\r\n  for the larvæ.\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned forms invade the skin of man by means of their\r\noral apparatus, by preference invading the orifices of the sebaceous\r\nglands so as to suck the blood; around the point attacked there arises\r\na wheal about the size of a lentil, and around the inserted hypopharynx\r\na fibrinous secretion, the “proboscis,” which, however, is a product\r\nof the host, just as chitinous secretions are provoked by Trombidia\r\nparasitic on Arthropods.\r\n\r\n  Further species, analogous in habit to _Leptus autumnalis_, are\r\n  described by Riley from Central and South America as _L. americanus_\r\n  and _L. irritans_.\r\n\r\n[_L. autumnalis_ attacks small mammals by preference, such as moles\r\nand hares, which are often literally covered with them. Dogs are also\r\nsubject to their attack, and cats suffer similarly. This mite also\r\nfrequently appears in colonies on cows; cavalry horses after autumn\r\nmanœuvres often suffer from an erythematous affection about the hocks\r\nand knees due to this pest.\r\n\r\n[A number of Leptus, so far undescribed, occur abroad which attack man\r\nin the same way as _L. autumnalis_ in Europe. Dr. Durham has brought\r\nme specimens from British Guiana called _bête rouge_; this species\r\nworks under the skin much as does our European species, but it is very\r\ndistinct, being considerably larger.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n\r\n*Trombidium tlalsahuate*, Lemaire, 1867.\r\n\r\n_T. tlalsahuate_ occurs in Mexico under conditions similar to those of\r\nLeptus here. It also frequently attacks men, and especially fastens\r\nitself on to the eyelids, in the axillae, navel, or on the prepuce; it\r\ninduces itching and swelling of the parts affected, and sometimes even\r\ncauses suppuration; the symptoms, however, generally disappear after a\r\nweek and remain localized.[333]\r\n\r\n[333] Lemaire, “Import. en France du tlalsahuate,” _Compt. rend. Acad.\r\nSci._, Paris, 1867, lxv, p. 215.\r\n\r\nOther species of mites which attack man are reported, mostly by\r\ntravellers, from various other places; zoologically, however, there\r\nis little known about them. The pou d’agouti in Guiana, niaibi in New\r\nGranada, colorada in Cuba, mouqui in Para, and the buschmucker in New\r\nGuinea represent a few of these.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Akamushi* or *Kedani*.\r\n\r\nIn a few districts of Japan there occurs a serious illness, with a\r\nmortality of 40 to 70 per cent. It is called river or flood fever, and\r\nthe Japanese doctors have connected it with a small mite (akamushi,\r\nkedani). Baelz has opposed this opinion on the grounds that he has\r\nrepeatedly observed the same species of mite in his dwelling without\r\nany subsequent illness occurring. According to Keïsuke Tanaka, however,\r\na connection certainly does exist, inasmuch as the akamushi, like\r\nLeptus, attacks persons to suck blood. If the mite is not removed,\r\nor if the spot attacked is injured by scratching, etc., a papule\r\nsurrounded by a red area forms, and a pustule ensues; and finally a\r\nblack scab covers the seat of injury. The lesion becomes the point of\r\nentrance of bacteria, especially a species of _proteus_ which produces\r\nriver fever. If the mites are carefully removed no general illness\r\ntakes place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 351.--The kedani mite. Enlarged. (After Tanaka.)]\r\n\r\nThe orange-red mites, which we only know in their larval condition,\r\nmeasure 0·16 to 0·38 mm. in length by 0·10 to 0·24 mm. in breadth. They\r\nhave leg-like palpi with three joints, hirsute bodies, and very hairy\r\nlegs composed of five segments, terminating with three ungues.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Tetranychidæ* (Spinning Mites).\r\n\r\n  These have tracheæ and eyes; the palpi are composed of four segments,\r\n  of which the last but one has a powerful claw.

In the female this pair of legs, like the second\r\n  and third pairs of both sexes, is provided with two hooklets and a\r\n  sucking disc. The cuticle of the body on the back is “annulated.”\r\n\r\n[This family of small transparent mites live normally as plant\r\nparasites.

There are six pairs of chitinous hairs on the dorsal surface\r\nand a lyre-shaped lamella on the posterior part. The female in the\r\nnon-gravid state is cylindrical in form, 0·2 mm. in length and 0·07 mm.\r\nin breadth; when gravid the posterior part of the body becomes enlarged\r\ninto a ball, which may attain 1·5 mm. in size, as in the case of _Pulex\r\npenetrans_ and of the female Termites. On emerging the young are\r\nalready provided with four pairs of legs and copulate soon after birth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 353.--_Pediculoides ventricosus._ _a_, male; _b_,\r\nyoung female; _c_, gravid female. Enlarged. (After Laboulbène and\r\nMégnin.)]\r\n\r\n  These animals live on the stalks of cereals, and feed on vegetable\r\n  and animal juices; they are also found on corn-infesting insects.\r\n  They invade the barns and seek out the insects living in the dry\r\n  grains of corn, or wait for an opportunity of obtaining food. They\r\n  have been repeatedly observed on human beings, particularly labourers\r\n  occupied in handling grain; their bite causes severe irritation,\r\n  local elevation and reddening of the epidermis, as well as fever. It\r\n  cannot be positively asserted that all cases of the occurrence of\r\n  cereal mites on man relate to _P. ventricosus_, as the descriptions\r\n  are often insufficient. Geber states that one form is _Chrithoptes\r\n  monunguiculosus_, or _Acarus hordei_; Flemming mentions _Tarsonemus\r\n  uncinatus_; Koller _Oribates_ sp.; and Karpelles _Tarsonemus\r\n  intectus_.\r\n\r\n  [The pregnant female Pediculoides has a large round inflated abdomen,\r\n  in which the ova hatch and the young mature.

The head is provided\r\nwith two very large scissors-like jaws and two large round eyes. The\r\nlegs are composed of five segments and are all of equal length; the\r\nthree anterior pairs of legs have pedunculated ambulacra, the posterior\r\nones terminate in a claw. The cuticle on the back is thickened in\r\nthree places, shield-like; the abdominal surface without scutellum\r\nis longitudinally striped and is beset with chitinous hairs. Colour\r\ngreenish to brownish-yellow. Eggs 0·046 to 0·040 mm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 354.--_Nephrophages sanguinarius_: male, ventral\r\nsurface. Enlarged.

(After Miyake and Scriba.)]\r\n\r\n  The authors discovered these mites, but always dead, in the urine\r\n  of a Japanese suffering from fibrinuria complicated with chyluria\r\n  and hæmaturia. They surmised that they were endoparasites, probably\r\n  situated in the kidney; but this view is not convincing, though they\r\n  also report that for a week, day after day, the mites were found in\r\n  the patient’s urine, as well as in urine drawn off by means of a\r\n  catheter, and in the water used to wash out the bladder (one or two\r\n  specimens and an egg). The statement that these mites have large eyes\r\n  makes the discovery suspicious, to say the least. The significance of\r\n  the discovery is not supported by the further statement that Disse\r\n  is supposed to have found an encapsuled mite closely related to the\r\n  Tyroglyphides on the wall of the vena cava.\r\n\r\n  In the case of Marpmann, who found a dead Acarid in the urine of a\r\n  man suffering from chronic nephritis, and in whom later examinations\r\n  proved negative, the author himself was of opinion that the mite had\r\n  reached the urine from outside.\r\n\r\n  We are certainly acquainted with mites living endoparasitically,\r\n  namely, the _Cysticolæ_, _Analgesinæ_, of which _Laminosioptes\r\n  gallinarum_ live in the intramuscular and subcutaneous connective\r\n  tissue of fowls, and _Cytoleichus sarcoptoïdes_ in their air sacs.\r\n  Another kind of mite (_Halarachne halichœri_) is occasionally found\r\n  in the nasal mucous membrane of the seal (_Halichœrus grypus_), and,\r\n  quite recently, _Pneumonyssus simicola_, which is more nearly related\r\n  to Halarachne, has been found in the lung of _Cynocephalus_ sp. It is\r\n  therefore not improbable that endoparasitic mites are found in man;\r\n  but no definite discovery has yet been made.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Eupodidæ.*\r\n\r\n  Small tracheate mites, with moderately long or short pedipalpi,\r\n  composed of four segments, of which the last segments bend; cheliceræ\r\n  forceps-shaped, with serrated edges; legs with two claws, more rarely\r\n  with one, and terminating in a tuft ornamented with fine hairs;\r\n  genital orifices on the abdomen, surrounded by a circle of little\r\n  hairs.

The species found in\r\nswallows’ nests is also said to be the same. This mite can remain for\r\nweeks without any food from its normal host. They only attack man\r\nwhen entering or cleaning dirty and neglected fowl-houses; they do\r\nnot produce a true dermatosis. They chiefly attack the backs of the\r\nhands and forearms of those who constantly attend poultry and give\r\nrise to symptoms similar to the papular eczema of scabies. That they\r\nmay remain some time upon the human body we know from the following\r\ncases out of many recorded: Geber observed that the Dermanyssus had\r\ncaused a diffused eczema on a woman, which lasted four weeks and then\r\ndisappeared. The _tique_ of F. V. Raspail is the bird Dermanyssus;\r\nhe records children and adults being attacked not only when handling\r\npigeons, but even when walking in a garden manured with pigeons’ dung.\r\nThe affection soon disappeared when the pigeons were destroyed and the\r\nexcreta buried.

The larvæ are six-legged.\r\n\r\n[The true ticks (_Ixodidæ_) are all blood-suckers, and as far as\r\nis known they do not take vegetable food at all. Not only are the\r\n_Ixodidæ_ important as actual parasites, but they are most so on\r\naccount of the fact that they are the active agents in carrying various\r\ndiseases in animals and apparently in man. It has been conclusively\r\nproved that the bont tick (_Amblyomma hebræum_) is the carrier of the\r\nfatal “heart-water fever” so rife amongst sheep in South Africa, that\r\nthe dog tick (_Hæmaphysalis leachi_) is the agent by which the protozoa\r\nthat cause malignant jaundice in dogs are distributed, that Texas\r\nfever in cattle is spread by _Rhipicephalus annulatus_, and Coast or\r\nRhodesian fever by _R. appendiculatus_ and _R. simus_. Their importance\r\nas disease carriers amongst mammals is therefore considerable, and\r\nit may prove to be so for man.[336] They frequently attack man, but\r\nchiefly, according to my observations, in their early stages in Europe;\r\nthis is not so, however, abroad. The life-history of a number of ticks\r\nhas been clearly demonstrated. Mr. Wheler has shown that in _Ixodes\r\nreduvius_ it is as follows: the female deposits her eggs in masses upon\r\nthe ground, gradually reducing in size as the eggs pass out, until she\r\nfinally remains a mere shrivelled empty bag and then dies. The eggs are\r\noval, golden brown in colour and smooth; in length they are 0·59 mm.;\r\nas in all _Ixodidæ_ they are covered with a glutinous secretion, by\r\nmeans of which they adhere together in masses. These egg masses may be\r\ndeposited anywhere on the ground, but amongst rough, coarse herbage\r\nseems to be the favourite place. The egg stage may last as long as\r\ntwenty-two weeks, or it may only take eight weeks. In the case of the\r\nbont tick a single female may deposit 15,000 or more eggs. The process\r\nof egg-laying is described as follows by Mr. Wheler: “When egg-laying\r\nis about to take place, the head is further depressed till it rests\r\nclose against the under side of the body. In this attitude the end of\r\nthe rostrum actually touches the genital orifice, the palpi being at\r\nthe same time widely opened out. Behind the head and from beneath the\r\nshield, at what for the purposes of explanation may be described as the\r\nback of the neck, a white, perfectly transparent, delicate gelatinous\r\nmembrane is brought down through inflation, either with air or with a\r\ntransparent fluid, above the head, which it temporarily conceals. The\r\nend of this membrane terminates in two conical points which appear\r\nto be covered with a glutinous secretion, and at the same time an\r\novipositor of a somewhat similar character, but only semi-transparent,\r\nis pushed forward from the genital orifice. This latter is a tube,\r\nwithin which is the egg. As the ovipositor projects it turns itself\r\ninside out, like the finger of a glove, leaving the egg protruded at\r\nthe end and lying between the two finger-like points of the membrane.\r\nThe membrane and the ovipositor are then withdrawn each from the other.\r\nThe egg adheres to the former, which collapses through the withdrawal\r\nof its contents, dragging the head forward and depositing it on the top\r\nof the head. Neither legs, palpi, nor the organs of the mouth take any\r\npart in oviposition, but after the collapse of the membrane the palpi\r\nare closed and the head is raised, by which action the egg is pushed\r\nforward to the front edge of the shield, forming in time an adherent\r\nmass of eggs, which are deposited in front of the tick.”\r\n\r\n[336] This has been proved in Uganda--so-called tick fever in man.\r\n\r\n[The egg gives rise to the larval form, the so-called “seed-tick”\r\nstage. At first these minute specks are pallid and soft, but they soon\r\nharden and darken in colour. These larvæ are six-legged and crawl up\r\ngrasses and various plants, and there await a passing host, waving\r\ntheir two front legs in the air and becoming attached by this means.\r\nThe larval ticks feed upon the blood of the host, and when replete\r\nfall to the ground, the body becoming inflated in the meanwhile. These\r\nlarvæ may remain on the host only two days, or they may remain much\r\nlonger. Eventually they moult on the ground and change to the nymph or\r\npupal stage, which has four pairs of legs. This pupa acts just as the\r\nlarva, crawls up plants and waits to regain the host. After a time the\r\nnymphs, having gorged themselves with blood, fall off and remain on the\r\nground for nearly three months; they then moult and become adult males\r\nand females. In about ten days they assume their normal colour and\r\nregain the host afresh; the female gradually swells until she attains\r\nthat large inflated form so characteristic of ticks. The male does not\r\nswell, but nevertheless feeds upon the host and fertilizes the female.\r\n\r\n[The act of coitus is strange: the male tick inserts its rostrum and\r\nother mouth organs into the sexual orifice of the female, between the\r\nbase of the posterior pair of legs. The males then die and the females\r\nfall to the ground and deposit the ova. There are variations in the\r\ndifferent species, of course, from those given above, which apply\r\nsolely to _Ixodes reduvius_. The larvæ and nymphs seem to attack most\r\nanimals, but the adults mainly keep to the same host. The periods in\r\nthe life-cycle of ticks not only vary in the different species, but in\r\neach species according to climatic conditions; for instance, in the\r\nbont tick (_Amblyomma hebræum_, Koch), Lounsbury has shown that the\r\ndevelopment is rapid in summer, slow in winter. The period from the\r\ntime that the female drops to the time she commences to lay eggs varied\r\nin specimens observed by him from twelve days in summer to twelve weeks\r\nin winter, and the complete period from the dropping of the female to\r\nthe hatching of the eggs, from eleven weeks in summer to thirty-six\r\nweeks through the winter. Other stages vary in a similar manner.\r\n\r\n[Ticks may live a long time away from the host provided they are\r\nsupplied with a certain amount of moisture. Mr. Wheler kept dog ticks\r\n(_Ixodes plumbeus_) in the larval stage for ten months; the pupæ, male\r\nand female, of _I. reduvius_ for six months.\r\n\r\n[I have kept _Ornithodorus moubata_ alive for eighteen months without\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n[In many species moulting takes place off the host, but in _I. bovis_,\r\nnow known as _Rhipicephalus annulatus_, Say (the carrier of Texas\r\nfever), moulting takes place on the host, and in many other species\r\nalso.[337] Some species of ticks leave their host on its death (as the\r\ndog tick, _Hæmaphysalis leachi_), but others die with the host (bont\r\ntick, _Amblyomma hebræum_).\r\n\r\n[337] Some ticks require only one (_R. decoloratus_), others two (_R.\r\nevertsi_), and some three hosts (_R. appendiculatus_) in order to reach\r\nmaturity.\r\n\r\n[Two species are of special importance, namely _Ornithodorus moubata_,\r\nMurray, which may infect human beings with the spirillum of African\r\ntick fever, and _Dermatocentor reticulatus_ var. _occidentalis_, which\r\nis said to be the carrier of Rocky Mountain spotted fever.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF _Ixodidæ_.\r\n\r\n[The ticks, or _Ixodidæ_, are divided into two groups, known as (1)\r\n_Argantinæ_, (2) _Ixodinæ_. The _Argantinæ_ are told from the _Ixodinæ_\r\nby the absence of dorsal or ventral shields in both sexes, and also by\r\nthe rostrum being placed beneath the cephalothorax, which covers it\r\nover: except in the larval stage, in which it is subterminal, and in\r\nthe pupal, when it partly projects. Legs nearly equal in length. The\r\nsexual orifice is situated between the two first pairs of legs. The\r\nmales usually smaller than the females.\r\n\r\n[The _Ixodinæ_ have the legs unequal, of six segments with two false\r\nsegments, making them look as if composed of eight segments. The\r\nrostrum is terminal and never hidden beneath the body. The sexual\r\norifice is situated between the bases of the first three pairs of\r\nlegs. In the males the orifice is obsolete or very rudimentary, sexual\r\nintercourse being effected by the rostrum. The males are smaller\r\nthan the females. The shield in the females never covers so much as\r\none-half of the body even when fasting, also in the larvæ and nymphs;\r\nbut in the males, which do not distend, the shield covers the body\r\nentirely, or all but a narrow margin. The _Ixodinæ_ are divided into\r\ntwo groups: (i) the _Ixodæ_, and (ii) the _Rhipicephalæ_. The former\r\nhave a long proboscis reaching nearly to the end of the palpi or even\r\na little longer than the palpi. The palpi are longer than broad. The\r\n_Rhipicephalæ_ have short palpi, nearly or quite as broad as long,\r\nmore or less conical or subtriangular. They were called _Conipalpi_ by\r\nCanestrini.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNOPSIS OF GENERA.\r\n\r\n  [A. _Argantinæ_: Rostrum concealed in adult, partly\r\n         exposed in larvæ and nymphs.

Fowls and ducks frequently die under its\r\nattack, particularly young ones, death being due to loss of blood.\r\nThis tick remains attached to its host during its larval stage for\r\nabout five days; it then leaves and moults in concealment. In its\r\nsubsequent stages it visits its host by night and remains for about an\r\nhour only, during which time it distends itself fully with blood. As\r\na nymph it moults twice, not once as do the cattle ticks. This tick\r\nand other Argas become larger with each moult, but retain their same\r\ngeneral appearance. The female visits the host every now and then, and,\r\nbetween, deposits eggs in sheltered crevices. About fifty to 120 are\r\ndeposited at once.

The mouth parts form a cone with\r\n  chelate cheliceræ, and three-jointed pedipalpi; the legs are usually\r\n  short, have five segments with a terminal claw and suckers, or either\r\n  one or other of these organs. The numerous species and genera live\r\n  free and from choice in slowly decomposing vegetable and animal\r\n  matter (cheese, cereals, flour, sugar, preserves, dried anatomical\r\n  preparations, bacon, dried fruits and fungi), also in the corners\r\n  of dwellings, etc.; they incidentally get into or on to man, or are\r\n  found in chamber utensils and in spittoons; actual parasites are\r\n  rarely found amongst them.\r\n\r\n  [The chief genera are Tyroglyphus, Rhizoglyphus, Glyciphagus,\r\n  Aleurobius and Histiogaster. The first three have typical characters\r\n  referred to, but are distinguished from each other by the two\r\n  former having the hairs on the dorsum smooth, whilst in Glyciphagus\r\n  they are hairy, plumose, or feathered. Rhizoglyphus can be told\r\n  from Tyroglyphus by having claws on the tarsi without any suckers;\r\n  Tyroglyphus has both claws and suckers. The larvæ are hexapod and\r\n  may become adult in the usual way by repeated moults, or they enter\r\n  the so-called hypopial stage. In this the eight-legged nymph becomes\r\n  quiescent, and during this stage it fixes itself to some insect or\r\n  other animal by a patch of suckers on the lower surface of the hind\r\n  end of the body, and is so carried from place to place. The hypopus\r\n  does not feed and has a hard shell and short legs. When it has\r\n  reached a new home it moults and development proceeds in the normal\r\n  way. Canestrini and Kramer treat the _Tyroglyphidæ_ as a sub-family\r\n  of the _Sarcoptidæ_, calling them sub-family _Tyroglyphinæ_,\r\n  the other sub-families being _Sarcoptinæ_, _Canestriniinæ_ and\r\n  _Analsinæ_.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSub-family. *Tyroglyphinæ.*\r\n\r\nGenus. *Aleurobius*, Canestrini.\r\n\r\n*Aleurobius* (*Tyroglyphus*) *farinæ*, de Geer (part), Koch.\r\n\r\nThe male measures 0·33 mm. in length by 0·16 mm. in breadth; the female\r\n0·6 mm. in length by 0·3 mm. in breadth. These mites possess five pairs\r\nof suctorial organs of a light colour; the legs are reddish. Moniez\r\nobserved them in Lille on the skin of labourers who had been unloading\r\nRussian corn. A few of the species generally mentioned under the\r\ndesignation of _Tyroglyphus siro_ are probably the common flour-mite,\r\nwhich also occurs on dry cheese.\r\n\r\n[The _farinæ_ of de Geer is an Aleurobius described by him in\r\n1778 (“Mém.

Female 0·61 mm. in length\r\nand 0·28 mm. in breadth.\r\n\r\n_T. siro_ and _T. longior_ live on dry cheese, in flour, on dried\r\nfruits, etc., and have been occasionally observed in the stools,\r\nurine, or pus of human beings, and also on their skin. The so-called\r\nvanillismus is to be attributed to these species.\r\n\r\n[_T. siro_ and _T. farinæ_ of Schrank (non Geer) are the same. They\r\nare described under other names, such as _Acarus lactis_, Linn.; _A.\r\nfavorum_, Herm., etc.; _A. lactis_ in milk, _farinæ_ in flour, and\r\n_siro_ in cheese; and as _A. dysenteriæ_, Linnæus (“Syst.

(After Fum. and\r\nRobin.)]\r\n\r\nIt is to these species that a case of dysentery was referred. Rolander,\r\nwho studied under Linnæus, was attacked by what was called dysentery.\r\nThe complaint soon gave way to treatment, but eight days after it\r\nreturned, soon disappeared, but again came a third time. All the time\r\nRolander had been living like the other inmates of the house, who\r\nall escaped. Linnæus, aware that Bartholemy had attributed dysentery\r\nto insects which he said he had seen, advised his student to examine\r\nhis stool. The result was that innumerable mites were found to be\r\npresent. Their presence was easily accounted for by the fact that they\r\nwere found in numbers in a cup made of juniper wood from which the\r\nstudent alone drank of a night, and they were found to be of the same\r\nspecies. What this species is we do not know. Linnæus called it _Acarus\r\ndysenteriæ_, but it was the same as his _Acarus siro_. No records have\r\noccurred since. It cannot be, as Latreille supposed, the cheese mite,\r\nfor they have been eaten by millions since, and it is strange no such\r\ncase has occurred again.\r\n\r\n\r\n[*Tyroglyphus minor* var. *Castellani*, Hirst,\r\n\r\ncauses the copra itch in persons employed in the copra mills in Ceylon.\r\nThe skin of the hands, arms, legs and even body becomes covered with\r\npruriginous papules, papulo-pustules and pustules near the head.\r\nThe eruption begins as a rule on the hands. The mites live in the\r\ncopra dust. They produce dermatitis. Castellani produced the disease\r\nexperimentally by rubbing copra dust containing mites on the skin of\r\nhealthy people.

It was\r\ntaken from beneath the cuticle of the sole of the foot of a negro in\r\nthe Seamen’s Hospital Ship on the Thames in 1841, in large sores of\r\na peculiar character confined to the soles of the feet. It appeared\r\nthat the disease was caused by its burrowing beneath the thick cuticle.\r\nThe disease was attributed to the wearing of a pair of shoes which had\r\nbeen lent to another negro whose feet had been similarly affected for\r\nnearly a year. The negro to whom the shoes were lent came from Sierra\r\nLeone. Mr. Busk stated that some water brought by Dr. Stranger from\r\nthe River Sinoe, on the coast of Africa, contained one nearly perfect\r\nspecimen, and fragments of others very similar to if not identical with\r\nthis Acarus. Mr. Busk adds that he had been informed by Staff-Assistant\r\nSurgeon P. D. Murray that at Sierra Leone there is a native pustular\r\ndisease called craw-craw--a species of itch breaking into open sores.\r\n\r\n[From Busk’s original figure I see no reason to doubt that this is a\r\nGlyciphagus.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Rhizoglyphus*, Claparède, 1869.\r\n\r\n*Rhizoglyphus parasiticus*, Dalgetty, 1901.\r\n\r\n  The _Rhizoglyphii_ are to be recognized by their short legs, which\r\n  are beset with spines, and by the tarsi, which terminate in a claw.\r\n  They live on plants, roots and bulbs, especially the bulbs of lilies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 365.--_Rhizoglyphus parasiticus._ _a._, male; _b._,\r\nfemale.

The Acari have an elliptical body,\r\nwhich is grey, but varies from greenish-yellow to greenish-brown when\r\nthe stomach is full. Eyes are absent.

Most are oviparous, some ovoviviparous. The eggs are\r\n  minute, ovoid, with a thin semi-transparent shell. They incubate in\r\n  a few days, varying from two to ten or eleven, as a rule. Generally\r\n  sarcoptic diseases lie dormant in winter and revive in spring and\r\n  summer in man; but in animals with long wool, such as sheep, they are\r\n  most active during winter, although revival of active reproduction\r\n  takes place in spring.\r\n\r\n  [Speaking generally, for the _Sarcoptidæ_ there are three distinct\r\n  stages in the development of the male, four in the female, as\r\n  follows:--\r\n\r\n  [(1) The larva. In this stage only three pairs of legs occur.\r\n\r\n  [(2) The nymph, in which a fourth pair of legs appear, and which thus\r\n  approaches the adult; but so far no sexual organs occur. Nymphs are\r\n  of two sizes--the smaller being future males, the larger females.\r\n\r\n  [(3) The next stage in the female is the age of _puberty_, the female\r\n  now being provided with a vulvo-anal slit; this so-called _pubescent\r\n  female_ is fertilized by the male. The male then dies. But the female\r\n  again casts her skin and enters another stage--\r\n\r\n  [(4) The ovigerous female--the egg-laying female--which has\r\n  differently modified legs.\r\n\r\n  [The rate at which these Acari breed is very great. Gerlach has\r\n  found that roughly, in each Sarcopt gallery, a female produces\r\n  fifteen individuals--ten females and five males--and that the\r\n  progeny reproduce again in fifteen days. The table given below thus\r\n  shows that one pair may produce the enormous number of 1,500,000\r\n  descendants in three months:--\r\n\r\n  First generation after 15 days         10 females       5 males\r\n  Second     \"       \"   30   \"         100    \"         50   \"\r\n  Third      \"       \"   45   \"       1,000    \"        500   \"\r\n  Fourth     \"       \"   60   \"      10,000    \"      5,000   \"\r\n  Fifth      \"       \"   75   \"     100,000    \"     50,000   \"\r\n  Sixth      \"       \"   90   \"   1,000,000    \"    500,000   \"\r\n\r\n                       = _1,500,000 individuals._\r\n\r\n  [These _Acarinæ_ are divided into three distinct sub-families, namely\r\n  the _Cytolichinæ_, _Sarcoptinæ_, _Canestriniinæ_.\r\n\r\n  [The _Sarcoptinæ_ alone interest us here, and of the nine genera the\r\n  three following are the most important:--\r\n\r\n  [(1) Sarcoptes, Latreille; Eusarcoptes.\r\n\r\n  [(2) Psoroptes, Gerv.; Dermatodectes, Gerlach; Dermatocoptes,\r\n  Fürstenberg.\r\n\r\n  [(3) Chorioptes, Gerv.; Symbiotes, Gerlach; Dermatophagus, Fürst.;\r\n  Sarco-dermatocedes, Del.\r\n\r\n  [The following are the main characters of these three genera:--\r\n\r\n  [_Sarcoptes_--round or slightly oval; the two posterior pairs of legs\r\n  being nearly or quite concealed beneath the body; the tarsi end in\r\n  simple long pedicles, with ambulatory suckers.\r\n\r\n  [_Psoroptes_--oval; the legs are all visible outside the margin of\r\n  the body; the ambulatory suckers are carried on long triangulated\r\n  stalks; the male has copulatory suckers and abdominal prolongations.\r\n\r\n  [_Chorioptes_--oval; legs long, thick, all visible; ambulatory\r\n  suckers very wide, carried at the end of simple, short pedicles.\r\n\r\n  [Sarcoptes make channels or furrows beneath the epidermis, and in\r\n  these the female lays her eggs.

There are\r\ntransverse rows of small bristles on the dorsal surface, and groups of\r\ntrichomæ on the front, sides and back. There are chitinous hairs at the\r\nbase of the legs; the two first pairs are provided with pedunculated\r\nambulacra in both sexes, the two posterior pairs terminate each with\r\na long bristle in the female; in the male the third pair of legs\r\nterminate in a bristle, the fourth pair with a pedunculated ambulacrum.\r\nThe anus is situated at the posterior border of the dorsal surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 367.--_Sarcoptes scabiei_: female, dorsal aspect.\r\n200/1. (After Fürstenberg.)]\r\n\r\n  At one time numerous species were differentiated, according to the\r\n  form of the Acarus, the number, position and size of the hairs and\r\n  spines, even according to the hosts, etc. All these characteristics,\r\n  however, fluctuate so considerably that absolute differentiation is\r\n  impossible; the supposed species may be regarded in the same light as\r\n  Mégnin did, as varieties. It is also hardly possible to distinguish\r\n  the mite of human scabies (_S. hominis_) from that of a number of\r\n  domestic animals (_S. squamiferus)_. It is best, therefore, to accept\r\n  one single species (_S. scabiei_), which may give rise to different\r\n  races or castes by living in the skin of man and mammals, but can\r\n  pass from one host to the other.\r\n\r\n[Canestrini and Kramer, in their monograph of the _Sarcoptidæ_,\r\nenumerate eighteen distinct species of this genus, from the dog, goat,\r\ncamel, horse, ferret, lion, wolf, sheep, pig, etc., and two species\r\nparasites of man (_scabiei_ and _scabiei-crustosæ_). There is no doubt\r\nthat they are distinct species.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\nThe _S. scabiei_ of man (_S. scabiei_ var. _hominis_) (length of male\r\n0·2 to 0·3 mm., and breadth 0·145 to 0·190 mm.; length of female 0·33\r\nto 0·45 mm., and breadth 0·25 to 0·35 mm.) lives in the tunnels that\r\nit excavates in the epidermis, and attacks by preference places with\r\nthin skin, such as between the fingers, in the bend of the elbows and\r\nknees, in the inguinal region, on the penis, on the mammæ, but may also\r\naffect other parts. The tunnels, which vary from a few millimetres\r\nto a centimetre and more long, do not run straight, but are somewhat\r\ntortuous; the female is found at the terminal end. The tunnels contain\r\nthe excrement and oval eggs (0·14 mm. in length) of the parasite;\r\nthe males are rarely met with, as they die off after copulation; the\r\nfemales die after depositing their eggs. The six-legged larvæ hatch out\r\nafter four to eight days, and after about a fortnight, during which\r\ntime they change their skins three times and undergo metamorphosis,\r\nthey begin themselves to burrow. Transmission from person to person\r\nrarely is effected through linen, but by direct contact (as in coitus);\r\ntransmission can be artificially effected on horses, dogs and monkeys,\r\nbut not on cats.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 368.--_Sarcoptes scabiei_: male, ventral aspect.\r\n200/1. (After Fürstenberg.)]\r\n\r\nThe smaller _S. scabiei-crustosæ_, Fürstenberg, is the cause of the\r\nitch that occurs chiefly in Norway; it is not certain whether this is a\r\ndistinct species of itch mite.\r\n\r\n[This is quite a distinct species, which is recorded from Germany and\r\nFrance. Mégnin (_Parasitology_, 1880, p. 165) described this as _S.\r\nscabiei_ var. _lupi_. The female is 140 µ long, 340 µ broad; the male\r\nis 170 µ long by 150 µ broad. In _Science_ (March 3, 1893, p. 125) is\r\nrecorded that at the Indiana Academy of Science Dr. Robert Hessler\r\nreferred to “a case of that extremely rare and almost extinct form\r\nof itch known as ‘Norway itch,’ the _scabies norvegica_ of Hebra,\r\n1852.” The afflicted man was covered with thick, creamy white, leathery\r\nscales; some of these scales measured over an inch in diameter and\r\n1/10 in. thick. A constant shedding of scales went on, a handful being\r\ngathered daily. They were found full of mites and eggs and riddled\r\nwith passages. Under treatment the mites were killed and the skin\r\nbecame normal. Dr. Hessler made a calculation of the number of eggs\r\nand mites, amounting to ova and shells 7,004,000, mites in all stages\r\n2,009,000.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\nThe following forms may be transmitted from DOMESTIC ANIMALS to MAN:--\r\n\r\n  (1) _S. scabiei_ var. _equi_.

In cats this mite usually lives in the cervical region,\r\nand thence spreads to the ears and head; it usually causes the death\r\nof the infected animals; it is easily transferable from cat to cat, is\r\ndifficult to transmit to rabbits, but once settled on them can easily\r\ninfect other rabbits. On the other hand, the transmission of the itch\r\nmite of the rabbit to the cat does not succeed.

Gervais, 1844; _Steatozoon folliculorum_, Wilson,\r\n  1847.\r\n\r\nAs in _Sarcoptes scabiei_, numerous varieties of this species are\r\nknown; the form parasitic on man lives in the hair-follicles, the\r\nmeibomian and sebaceous glands, and hardly ever causes inconvenience;\r\nthe male measures 0·3 mm. in length and the female about 0·4 mm. in\r\nlength. The eggs 0·06 to 0·08 mm. in length, 0·04 to 0·05 mm. in\r\nbreadth, and are thin-shelled. The creatures are always attached with\r\nthe head end downwards in the parts mentioned; they are most frequent\r\nin the sebaceous glands of the face, by the nose, lips and forehead,\r\nbut they may be present on the abdomen and on other parts of the body.\r\nThey may occasionally obstruct the excretory gland ducts, thus causing\r\ninflammation of the gland (comedones); their agglomeration in the\r\nmeibomian glands sets up inflammation of the margins of the eyelids.\r\nThere are generally only a few specimens in a gland. According to\r\nsome statements Demodex occurs in 50 per cent. of mankind and even in\r\nchildren; they survive the death of their hosts by several days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 370.--_Demodex folliculorum_ of the dog.

The body\r\n  is elongated, vermiform, flattened or cylindrical, and more or less\r\n  distinctly annulated. The head, thorax, and abdomen are not defined\r\n  from each other (fig. 371). The elliptical mouth, surrounded by a\r\n  chitinous ring, is situated at the anterior end, on the ventral\r\n  surface, and the intestine leading straight through the body opens at\r\n  the posterior end. Two retractile hooks are at the sides of the mouth\r\n  (fig. 372); these are usually considered to be the terminal joints of\r\n  two pairs of legs, but it appears to be more correct to regard them\r\n  as the remains of the antennæ and palpi (Stiles). According to this\r\n  opinion, the legs in the adult state are completely degenerated.\r\n\r\n  The nervous system is reduced to an œsophageal ring. No organs of\r\n  sense are recognizable except the papillæ at the anterior end. There\r\n  are neither organs of circulation nor of respiration.[355]\r\n\r\n[355] What are designated as stigmata in the Linguatulides are the\r\norifices of sebaceous glands.\r\n\r\n  The sexes are distinct. In the small male the sexual orifice is\r\n  situated ventrally in the anterior part of the body; in the female it\r\n  is placed near the anus. The _Linguatulidæ_ lay eggs, and from each\r\n  egg, after being conveyed into an intermediate host, a four-legged\r\n  larva, with rudimentary mouth parts, hatches out. It goes through\r\n  a series of metamorphoses, and passes through a second larval\r\n  condition, which, however, possesses the essential characteristics\r\n  of the fully developed form. Sooner or later it migrates during this\r\n  stage, and reaches its final host, mammal or reptile, in the nostrils\r\n  or lungs of which the adult _Linguatulidæ_ live.\r\n\r\n[As adults they live as internal blood feeders in various birds,\r\nreptiles and mammals, especially in the nasal and respiratory passages.\r\nThe larval stage occurs in another host in an encysted condition; this\r\nhost is usually an animal preyed upon by the species in which the\r\nsexual forms are found. The larvæ bore through the walls of the host’s\r\nstomach and enter liver and spleen or brain, where they encyst; here\r\nthey grow until they assume almost the appearance of the adult. These\r\nencysted larvæ on being eaten later make their way into the nasal\r\npassages and lungs, where they mature. Both adults and larvæ occur in\r\nman, as mentioned later.\r\n\r\n  [Three genera are recognized in this family:--\r\n\r\n  [(1) _Linguatula._--Body flat, annulated.

The\r\nyoung larvæ hatch out in the stomach; they possess a thickened anterior\r\nbody with rudimentary mouth parts and two pairs of limbs; the body\r\ngradually tapers to a short tail.\r\n\r\nThe larvæ of the _Linguatulidæ_ bore through the intestinal wall and\r\nreach the liver, more rarely the mesenteric glands, etc.; they here\r\nbecome encysted and enter a sort of pupal stage in which they lose\r\ntheir limbs; after several moultings and gradual growth the second\r\nlarval stage, having the appearance of the adult Linguatula, sets in.\r\nAbout five to six months after infection the creatures have become 4 to\r\n6 mm. long, possess eighty to ninety rings, which have a series of fine\r\npoints on their posterior border; the mouth and intestine are formed,\r\nthe sexual organs mature and the two pairs of hooks are near the mouth.\r\nThis larval stage (fig. 372) has been known for a long time, but it\r\nwas regarded as an independent species of animal, and therefore had a\r\nseparate name (_Linguatula serrata_, Fr.; _Pentastoma denticalatum_,\r\nRud., etc.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 373.--_Linguatula rhinaria_: on left, eggs in\r\ngelatinous covering, 110/1. On right, first larval stage. 300/1. (After\r\nM. Koch.)]\r\n\r\nLater these Linguatula larvæ make an attempt to escape from their\r\nhosts, and this, of course, can only be effected by means of an active\r\nmigration; they leave the cysts, and according to their respective\r\npositions in the abdominal or pleural cavities they reach the bronchi\r\nor the intestine, and finally pass out; they may be again sniffed\r\nup by dogs and settle in their nasal cavities. Still this outward\r\nmigration does not appear to be necessary for further development. A\r\nportion of the larvæ gain access to the nasal cavities directly through\r\nthe trachea, and thus herbivorous mammals certainly become directly\r\ninfected. In most cases the infection of dogs, wolves and foxes, that\r\nis, of carnivorous mammals, takes place through consuming the bodies\r\nof mammals, or parts of them, such as the liver and lungs, which are\r\naffected with the second larval form; in any case most larvæ obtain\r\naccess first to the stomach of their host, from here they make an\r\nactive migration through the œsophagus to the oral and nasal cavities,\r\nin which they settle. It is possible also that the same larvæ which\r\nare free in the oral cavity when the food is being eaten migrate into\r\nthe nasal cavities. After being stationary a fresh skin is formed and\r\nthe spine-bearing cuticula are thrown off. The male attains its full\r\nsize in the fourth, and the female in the sixth month. The duration of\r\nlife is stated to be from fifteen months to several years.\r\n\r\n  _L. rhinaria_ has been observed in man in the adult as well as in the\r\n  larval condition (_Pentastoma denticulatum_). Zenker first called\r\n  attention to the occurrence of the larva in man, having found it\r\n  nine times in the liver in 168 autopsies. Heschl found it twice in\r\n  Vienna in twenty autopsies, Virchow found it in Würzburg and Berlin,\r\n  Wagner in Leipzig (10 per cent.), and Frerichs in Breslau five times\r\n  in forty-seven autopsies. The parasite is much less frequent in\r\n  Switzerland. According to Klebs, one case occurs in 900 autopsies,\r\n  and according to Zaeslin two cases occurred in Basle to 1,914\r\n  autopsies. In the Seamen’s Hospital in Kronstadt _P. denticulatum_\r\n  has been found six times in 659 autopsies. It was almost always the\r\n  liver that contained one or a few specimens. The parasite was very\r\n  rarely found in the kidney or spleen, or encysted in the intestinal\r\n  wall. The adult _L. rhinaria_ is far more rarely observed in man.\r\n\r\n  A case reported by Landon that related to a blacksmith of Elbing is\r\n  particularly interesting. This man accompanied the campaign of 1870;\r\n  he soon, however, fell ill with pains in the liver, accompanied by\r\n  icterus and intestinal disorders. Soon after the war, and after the\r\n  symptoms were reduced to icterus and weakness, bleeding of the nose\r\n  set in and continued with slight intermissions for seven years;\r\n  an unpleasant sensation of pressure in the left nasal cavity set\r\n  in, with inflammatory swelling of the mucous membrane. At last, in\r\n  the summer of 1878, when the pressure in the nose had considerably\r\n  increased, a Linguatula was expelled from the nose with a violent\r\n  attack of sneezing, and lived for three days longer in water. The\r\n  bleeding of the nose then ceased and the patient soon recovered.\r\n  There can be no doubt that the first illness was connected with\r\n  the invasion in the liver of numerous larvæ of Pentastoma, and\r\n  disappeared after their encystment; one or a few of these must\r\n  subsequently have found its way to the nose and settled there.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Porocephalus.*\r\n\r\n*Porocephalus constrictus*, v. Siebold, 1852.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Nematoideum hominis_, Diesing, 1851; _Pentastomum\r\n  constrictum_, v. Sieb., 1852; _Porocephalus constrictus_, Stiles,\r\n  1893.\r\n\r\nPorocephalus is distinguished from Linguatula by its cylindrical body\r\nand by certain internal structures. _Porocephalus constrictus_ is at\r\npresent only known in its larval stage. It is milk white in colour with\r\ngolden-yellow hooklets. Number of rings, twenty-three. Length 13 mm.,\r\nbreadth 2·2 mm. There are no prickles on the posterior border of the\r\nannulations of the body.\r\n\r\n  This species was first discovered by Pruner encysted in the livers\r\n  of two negroes in Cairo. Bilharz reported two further cases in which\r\n  the parasites were encysted in the liver and in the mucosa of the\r\n  intestine; a few other observations have been made by Fenger, Aitken,\r\n  Giard and Chalmas. Aitken’s report deals with soldiers of the British\r\n  Colonies in Africa. The parasites were discovered in the liver as\r\n  well as in the lung, and appear to have been the cause of death in\r\n  one case (pneumonia, peritonitis).\r\n\r\nPruner has found the same parasite also in the liver of the giraffe.\r\n\r\n  It has recently been assumed that _Porocephalus constrictus_ is the\r\n  larva of _Pentastoma moniliforme_, Diesing, 1835, that attains a\r\n  length of 70 mm. and lives in the lungs of African Pythonides. The\r\n  larva is known to have been ejected from monkeys (_Cercopithecus\r\n  albogularis_, _Cynocephalus maimon_), from the giraffe\r\n  (_Camelopardalis giraffa_), from a species of hyæna (_Proteles\r\n  cristatus_), and should be expected to occur frequently in smaller\r\n  mammals which have been swallowed by African serpents of enormous\r\n  size.\r\n\r\n[The three species of _Pentastomidæ_, or tongue worms, found in man are\r\n_Linguatula serrata_, Frölich; _Porocephalus armillatus_, Wyman; and\r\n_Pentastoma moniliformis_, Diesing.\r\n\r\n[(1) _Linguatula serrata_ has been referred to under a great number\r\nof names.[356] It is a frequent parasite in dogs, oxen and sheep; as\r\nan adult in the dog and also in the fox and wolf. The nymphal stage\r\nis found in rats, hares, rabbits, the horse, oxen, sheep, goats,\r\npigs, camels, deer, the African and long-eared hedgehogs, porcupine,\r\nguinea-pig and peccary. In man it is found in both adult and nymphal\r\nstages. Sambon says the nymphal stage is of frequent occurrence, but\r\nis usually overlooked. Zenker, who first found it in man, obtained it\r\nin nine out of 160 _post-mortems_, usually encysted in the liver. It\r\nis then said to be harmless. Landon, in 1878, found the adult in man,\r\nthe patient suffering from epistaxis for about seven years; in the end\r\nduring a fit of sneezing the living parasite was ejected through the\r\nnostril. This case is of particular interest as it appears to suggest\r\nthat this Acarid may now and then pass its entire development in the\r\nsame host, or at any rate may actively migrate from the liver to the\r\nnasal cavities after a period of encystment in the liver or elsewhere,\r\nwhich has also been observed in herbivorous animals (_vide_ also\r\np. 526).\r\n\r\n[356] Synonymy given by Sambon: Adult form, _Ténia lanceolé_, Chabert, 1787; _Ver rhinaire_,\r\nChabert, 1787; _Tænia rhinaris_, Pilger, 1805; _Tænia lanceolata_, Rudolphi, 1805; _Cochlus\r\nrhinarius_, Rudolphi, 1805; _Prionoderma rhinaria_, Rudolphi, 1808; _Polystoma tænioides_,\r\nRudolphi, 1809; _Linguatula tænioides_, Lamark, 1816; _Prionoderma lanceolata_, Cuvier,\r\n1817; _Pentastoma tænioides_, Rudolphi, 1819; _Linguatula lanceolata_, de Blainville, 1828;\r\n_Linguatula rhinaris_, Railliet, 1885; _Linguatula caprina_, R.

The HEAD is a\r\n  roundish unsegmented capsule and possesses four pairs of appendages.\r\n  The first pair are the various shaped feelers (antennæ), which are\r\n  placed on the superior surface of the head next to the eyes; then\r\n  more ventrally placed a pair of upper jaws (mandibles) without\r\n  palpi and without articulations; they are powerful masticatory\r\n  organs.[359] The first pair of lower jaws (maxillæ) are jointed and\r\n  bear a palpus (palpus maxillaris); the second pair of maxillæ are\r\n  soldered together and form the lower lip (labium), and likewise carry\r\n  a palpus labialis on each side. The upper lip (labrum), as well as\r\n  the other parts (which, however, are only appendages), belong to the\r\n  mouth, which is really formed of a number of closely united pieces.\r\n  The mouth parts are modified according to the functions required\r\n  of them. _Coleoptera_, _Neuroptera_, and _Orthoptera_ have biting\r\n  or masticatory mouth parts which conform with the scheme described\r\n  above. In the licking mouth parts of the _Hymenoptera_ the maxillæ\r\n  and under lip are considerably elongated, while the mandibles\r\n  retain their form and are used for triturating the food; in the\r\n  _Lepidoptera_ nearly all the mouth parts are shortened except the\r\n  maxillæ, which form a long and sometimes spirally rolled suctorial\r\n  proboscis; the _Diptera_ and _Rhynchota_ have piercing and sucking\r\n  mouth parts. The mandibles and maxillæ are metamorphosed into\r\n  needle-like structures, while the suctorial apparatus is formed by\r\n  the labrum.\r\n\r\n[359] [The mandibles are only powerful masticatory organs in\r\nbiting-mouthed insects (_Mandibulata_); in the sucking or\r\npiercing-mouthed insects they may be absent, or in the form of\r\nneedle-like stylets (_Haustellata_).--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n  The thorax consists of three segments, which are frequently united;\r\n  ventrally it carries three pairs of legs, which consist of a definite\r\n  number of articulated pieces joined together. Their form also changes\r\n  according to their function, so that legs for running, walking,\r\n  digging, swimming, jumping, and preying are seen. A pair of wings are\r\n  respectively attached to the last and last but one thoracic rings,\r\n  and these may be traced back, not to metamorphosed appendages, but to\r\n  tracheal branchia. They are composed of chitinous membranes supported\r\n  by branched structures (veins or ribs). Their size and formation\r\n  vary; they are seldom of equal size and form (_Neuroptera_);\r\n  often the posterior wings are larger than the anterior wings, the\r\n  former then only serving as protective coverings for the latter\r\n  (_Coleoptera_), or the anterior wings are larger (_Lepidoptera_), or\r\n  the posterior wings are shortened or are entirely absent (_Diptera_);\r\n  and finally there are insects in which both pairs of wings are\r\n  lacking.[360]\r\n\r\n[360] [As in the order _Aptera_, which includes the Thysanura and\r\nCollembola, and also exceptions in other orders, as the fleas amongst\r\n_Diptera_, the Mutillus and ants amongst _Hymenoptera_.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n  The abdomen retains its segmentation, but, with the exception of\r\n  a few groups related to the primitive forms of insects, has no\r\n  appendages in the imago condition; the abdomen usually consists of\r\n  ten segments, on the last of which the anus is situated.\r\n\r\n  We need only observe the following characters in considering the\r\n  anatomy of insects:--\r\n\r\n  The EPIDERMIS consists of the chitinous cuticle, which is separate\r\n  from the cellular layer beneath (hypodermis); the various appendages\r\n  are supported by the chitinous layer.\r\n\r\n  The INTESTINAL CANAL usually consists of the anterior, median and\r\n  terminal intestine, and as a rule passes straight through the body;\r\n  salivary glands discharge into the anterior part, and, in some cases,\r\n  yield a stiffening secretion which serves for spinning webs; numerous\r\n  or scanty hepatic tubes are appended to the median intestine, while\r\n  on the border between the median and terminal intestine open four\r\n  to six long tubes (vasa malpighiana), which act as urinary organs.\r\n  Finally the end portion of the intestine carries various glands (anal\r\n  and rectal glands, etc.).\r\n\r\n  The CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM agrees in structure with that of the\r\n  Annelids, but is more highly developed. The pharyngeal ring surrounds\r\n  the front part of the intestine; the sensory nerves originate from\r\n  its SUPERIOR PHARYNGEAL GANGLIA and are the seat of the higher\r\n  psychical functions; the INFERIOR PHARYNGEAL GANGLIA govern the mouth\r\n  parts, and in addition appear to regulate the movements (cerebellum)\r\n  of the vertebrates.\r\n\r\n  The chain of GANGLIA lying on the ventral side of the abdomen\r\n  consists primitively of pairs of ganglia corresponding with the\r\n  twelve segments, which are connected by longitudinal and transverse\r\n  commissures. But many changes in the ganglia may be seen in insects\r\n  caused by partial or entire amalgamation of single ganglia, so that\r\n  in a few cases only one abdominal ganglion is present. In conclusion,\r\n  a definite INTESTINAL NERVOUS SYSTEM is always present.\r\n\r\n  Of the organs of sense the FACETTED EYES, situated at the sides of\r\n  the head, deserve special mention, as do also the ORGANS OF TOUCH and\r\n  SMELL, situated on the antennæ, and the ORGANS OF HEARING and taste,\r\n  or finer sensations, situated at the mouth and in the buccal cavity.\r\n\r\n  The sounds emitted by insects are, as a rule, produced by the\r\n  friction or beating of certain chitinous parts, but sounds are also\r\n  produced in breathing (flies).\r\n\r\n  The ORGANS OF RESPIRATION, the so-called tracheæ, are highly\r\n  developed; there are openings (stigmata) at the sides of the body\r\n  which draw in air by means of the active participation of the muscles\r\n  of the body. The number of stigmata varies between two and ten pairs;\r\n  the tracheæ themselves branch off from the trunks in the most varied\r\n  manner, and carry air to the internal organs.\r\n\r\n  The colourless BLOOD circulates between the tissues and organs, and\r\n  is kept circulating by the contraction of a chambered dorsal vessel\r\n  provided with ostia, and which terminates in a short aorta opening at\r\n  the anterior end.\r\n\r\n  Insects are SEXUALLY DISTINCT; their sexual glands are in pairs and\r\n  have a tubular structure, but the testicular tubules are united\r\n  together by a capsule into an oval testicle; exceptionally, also, the\r\n  excretory canals are double, as also the sexual orifices; usually the\r\n  paired canals unite into a single oviduct or spermatic duct which\r\n  terminates at the posterior end of the body after receiving the\r\n  products of various glands.\r\n\r\n  As to the HISTORY OF THE DEVELOPMENT of insects, all that is\r\n  necessary to mention here is that the young hatched from eggs only\r\n  exceptionally (as in _Apterygota_) resemble the adult parent (insecta\r\n  ametabola); as a rule they differ from them not only in the shape\r\n  of the body, but also more or less by their manner of life, and\r\n  only attain the form of the parent through METAMORPHOSIS. This is\r\n  a gradual process (insecta hemimetabola) in the _Rhynchota_ and\r\n  _Orthoptera_, or a sudden one with a stage of inanition (insecta\r\n  metabola) in the other orders. This stage of rest or inanition, the\r\n  PUPA, concludes the larval life (caterpillar, maggot, etc.); during\r\n  the pupal stage no nourishment at all is taken, but the internal\r\n  organs undergo changes; in some forms the rest is not absolute, as\r\n  voluntary local movements may take place (pupæ of gnats).\r\n\r\n  The insects are divided into numerous orders according to the form\r\n  of the mouth parts, the structure of the wings, as well as the\r\n  manner of the development; with the exception of the lowest group\r\n  (_Apterygota_), which is most nearly related to the ancestors of the\r\n  insects, and which has no wings and undergoes no metamorphosis, all\r\n  the remaining orders, which are termed _Pterygota_, have wings on the\r\n  thorax, though there are, of course, a few species and families of\r\n  this group which have lost their wings.\r\n\r\n  The _Pterygota_ include--\r\n\r\n  (1) _Orthoptera._--Biting mouth parts, anterior wings leathery,\r\n  posterior wings thin, folded longitudinally; metamorphosis incomplete\r\n  (grasshoppers, crickets, cockroaches).\r\n\r\n  (2) _Pseudoneuroptera._--Biting mouth parts, wings of equal size,\r\n  thin, not folded up (dragon-flies, hair and feather lice, termites).\r\n\r\n  (3) _Rhynchota_ or _Hemiptera_.--Mouth parts formed for puncturing\r\n  and sucking; wings alike, or the anterior wings may be thickened,\r\n  parchment-like at their base (plant lice, cicadæ, bugs and true lice).\r\n\r\n  (4) _Neuroptera._--Biting mouth parts; wings alike, thin;\r\n  metamorphosis complete (ant-lions, lace-wing flies, etc.).\r\n\r\n  (5) _Trichoptera._--Licking mouth parts; anterior wings narrow,\r\n  posterior wings longitudinally folded, both ornamented with little\r\n  hairs; the larvæ are worm-like in form, live in water, and breathe\r\n  through tracheal gills (may flies, etc.).\r\n\r\n  (6) _Lepidoptera._--Suctorial mouth parts; wings covered with scales\r\n  (butterflies).\r\n\r\n  (7) _Coleoptera._--Biting mouth parts; anterior wings thickened and\r\n  differ in colour, appearance and function from the thin, folded\r\n  posterior wings (beetles).\r\n\r\n  (8) _Hymenoptera._--Mouth parts for licking and biting; the wings\r\n  alike, membranous (ichneumon flies, ants, wasps, bees, humble bees).\r\n\r\n  (9) _Diptera._--Mouth parts formed for puncturing, sucking or\r\n  licking; posterior wings degenerated (gnats, flies, gadflies, fleas).\r\n\r\n  (10) _Strepsiptera._--Anterior wings shortened; the female without\r\n  wings and living parasitically (fan-wings).\r\n\r\nThe parasites of man occur amongst the _Rhynchota_, _Coleoptera_, and\r\namongst the _Diptera_.\r\n\r\n  [The most usual and recent classification of the _Hexapoda_ is the\r\n  following:--\r\n\r\n  (1) _Aptera._--Wingless insects; scarcely any metamorphosis.\r\n\r\n  (2) _Neuroptera._--Four membranous wings, frequently with much\r\n  network; the front pair not much, if at all, harder than the under\r\n  pair; the latter with but little or no fan-like action in closing;\r\n  mandibulate; metamorphosis variable, but rarely complete.\r\n\r\n  (3) _Orthoptera._--Four wings; front pair coriaceous or leather-like,\r\n  usually smaller than the other pair, which are of more delicate\r\n  texture and contract in repose like a fan; mandibulate; metamorphosis\r\n  complete.\r\n\r\n  (4) _Thysanoptera._--Four very narrow fringed wings; mouth\r\n  imperfectly suctorial; metamorphosis slight.\r\n\r\n  (5) _Hemiptera._--Four wings; the front pair either all transparent\r\n  or with the basal half leathery; mouth suctorial; metamorphosis\r\n  slight.\r\n\r\n  (6) _Diptera._--Two membranous wings only; mouth suctorial, very\r\n  varied; metamorphosis complete.\r\n\r\n  (7) _Lepidoptera._--Four large wings covered with scales; mouth\r\n  suctorial, metamorphosis great.\r\n\r\n  (8) _Hymenoptera._--Four membranous wings; front pair larger than\r\n  hind, which do not fold up in repose; mandibulate, sometimes with a\r\n  tubular proboscis; metamorphosis complete.\r\n\r\n  (9) _Coleoptera._--Four wings, the front pair hard and horny\r\n  (elytra), meeting in a line over the back and covering the delicate\r\n  hind pair; mandibulate; metamorphosis complete.\r\n\r\n  [There are two other well-known arrangements, namely, Packard’s and\r\n  Brauer’s, of recent date, but the one given here, which is based on\r\n  Linnaeus’ grouping by Dr. Sharp, is by far the simplest.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder. *Rhyncota.*[361]\r\n\r\n[361] [Usually known as _Hemiptera_.

They were first mentioned from Strasburg in the\r\n  eleventh century, and in England about 1500.\r\n\r\n  [This is the common bed bug of northern latitudes and must not be\r\n  confused with the tropical bed bug (_C. rotundatus_). The bed bug can\r\n  migrate from one house to another; this especially takes place when a\r\n  house is uninhabited. They escape from windows and pass along walls,\r\n  water-pipes and gutters, and so reach adjoining houses. This noxious\r\n  pest accompanies man wherever he goes; ships and trains become\r\n  infested, especially the former.\r\n\r\n  [A characteristic feature in this animal is the peculiar odour it\r\n  produces, like many others in the same group of insects. This odour\r\n  comes from a clear, oily volatile liquid secreted by glands in\r\n  various parts of the body. Although the normal food is man’s blood,\r\n  the bed bug can subsist upon moist wood, dust and dirt that collects\r\n  in crevices in floors, walls, furniture, etc. The puncturing mouth\r\n  consists of a fleshy under lip, within which lie four thread-like\r\n  hard filaments which pierce the flesh, the blood being drawn up\r\n  through the beak.\r\n\r\n  [The eggs are oval, white, with a projecting rim around one end,\r\n  with a lid which is pushed off when the young hatch; they are laid\r\n  in cracks and crevices in batches of from twelve to fifty. The egg\r\n  stage lasts from seven to ten days. The larval stage so gradually\r\n  passes into the adult that one scarcely notices the change; during\r\n  its growth the skin is cast five times, and at the change the\r\n  little wing-pads are seen, showing that the adult stage is reached.\r\n  The young larva is at first pale yellowish-white. It resembles\r\n  the parent, but has no trace of elytra. Although eleven weeks is\r\n  said to be necessary for their development, the stages may be gone\r\n  through much more rapidly; Howard and Marlatt[362] give seven weeks\r\n  in some instances. It seems pretty certain that these Cimex only\r\n  take one meal of blood between each moult and another preceding egg\r\n  laying.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n[362] “Household Insects,” Howard and Marlatt, _Bull._ 4 (N.S.), U.S.\r\nDept.

In _C. rotundatus_ it is uniformly convex,\r\nwhilst in _C. lectularius_ the lateral edges are flat and sometimes\r\neven concave. The abdomen of _rotundatus_ is also rather more elongate.\r\n\r\n[This species is of considerable importance, as according to Patton it\r\nmay act partly as the intermediary host of the piroplasma of kala-azar.\r\n\r\n[Wenyon found at Bagdad that _Cimex_ sp. would take up Leishmania from\r\nOriental sore, and that the parasite developed into flagellate form.\r\nPatton came to the conclusion that the bed bug transmitted Oriental\r\nsore in Cambay, India, but Wenyon contests this view (_vide Journ.\r\nLond.

The insect is figured in a coloured plate (No. 9) in _Mem.\r\nInst. Oswaldo Cruz_, 1909, i, fasc. 2, pp. 158–218.\r\n\r\nA further account is given by Neiva.[364]\r\n\r\n[364] _Mem. Inst.

(Blood-sucking Cone-nose).\r\n\r\nThis bug is also known as the Texas or Mexican bed bug, also as the\r\nbig bed bug. It is particularly troublesome in the Mississippi Valley\r\nin bedrooms. The bite is very severe and results in more pronounced\r\nswelling and inflammation than that of the Cimex. Normally this genus\r\nfeeds upon the blood of mammals and insects. Its fondness for human\r\nblood appears to be quite a new habit, and appears limited to the\r\nmature insect only. It is nearly an inch long, flat, head very narrow\r\nand long, the rostrum short and thick. In colour it is dark brown\r\nwith pink markings. They are fully winged when adult, and they fly\r\nwith ease, entering houses on the wing, especially being attracted by\r\nlights in windows; they also run swiftly. Like the bed bug they conceal\r\nthemselves during the day and come out at night and bite the sleeper.\r\nThe effect of the bite is very varied, but as a rule a sore, itching\r\nwound, accompanied by burning pain and swellings, which may extend\r\nover a good deal of the body, occur. A specific poison is undoubtedly\r\ninjected into the puncture; but no doubt serious results are also due\r\nto the beak being contaminated through the insects feeding upon foul\r\ncarrion. Mr. Lembert, when bitten by a _Conorhinus_ sp. (?) on the\r\nPacific slope, exhibited the following symptoms: an itching sensation\r\nextending up the leg, large blotches manifesting themselves on the\r\nupper part of the limb and extending up to the hands and arms; his lips\r\nswelled and the itching and swelling extended over the head; there was\r\nalso much nausea. Similar results are recorded from other regions.[365]\r\n\r\n[365] “Household Insects,” p. 42.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of the _C. sanguisuga_ are at first white, then become yellow,\r\nthen pink; the young hatch in twenty days. There are two larval and\r\ntwo pupal stages, the latter showing wing-pads. The eggs are laid and\r\nthe young feed out of doors, chiefly upon insects. It is particularly\r\nabundant in April and May indoors.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Conorhinus*, _sp. novum_ (Monster Bug).\r\n\r\nAnother species; acts in a very similar way in California, the bite\r\nbeing very poisonous.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Conorhinus rubrofasciatus*, de Geer[366] (Malay Bug).\r\n\r\n[366] [_First Report Econ.

It is recorded as\r\ninflicting “a very nasty sting, which is done by the huge proboscis.”\r\nAcute pain and inflammation follow in a few minutes. In one case the\r\nwhole leg became swollen. This species occurs over the whole Oriental\r\nregion, in Madagascar and Sierra Leone. It is dark brown in colour with\r\ndusky yellow or brick-red markings on the pronotum and elytra. Donovan\r\nsuggests that it may be connected with the kala-azar piroplasma.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Conorhinus renggeri*, Herr-Schäff\r\n\r\n(Great Black Bug of Pampas).\r\n\r\nThis large black bug is mentioned by Darwin,[367] who states as\r\nfollows: “At night I experienced an attack (for it deserves no less a\r\nname) of the benchuca, a species of Reduvius, the great black bug of\r\nthe Pampas. It is most disgusting to feel soft wingless insects, about\r\nan inch long, crawling over one’s body. Before sucking they are quite\r\nthin, but afterwards they become round and bloated with blood, and in\r\nthis state are easily crushed. One which I caught at Iquique (for they\r\nare found in Chili and Peru) was very empty. When placed on a table,\r\nand though surrounded by people, if a finger was presented the bold\r\ninsect would immediately protrude its sucker, make a charge and, if\r\nallowed, draw blood. No pain was caused by the wound. It was curious\r\nto watch its body during the action of sucking, as in less than ten\r\nminutes it changed from being flat as a wafer to a globular form. This\r\none feast, for which the benchuca was indebted to one of the officers,\r\nkept it fat during four whole months, but after the first fortnight it\r\nwas quite ready to have another suck.” Mr. Kirby[368] also refers to\r\nthis species.\r\n\r\n[367] Charles Darwin, “A Naturalist’s Voyage” (Voyage of the _Beagle_),\r\n1888, p. 330.\r\n\r\n[368] “Text-book of Entomology,” 1885, p. 205.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Conorhinus variegatus* (Variegated Cone-nose).\r\n\r\nOccurs in Florida in houses, and chases bugs (Cimex) and flies; not\r\ndefinitely known to bite man.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Conorhinus nigrovarius.*\r\n\r\nThis species occurs in South America.

Swelling and irritation result which may last a week, and\r\nmay even cause death.[370] In 1899 it was very abundant at Washington\r\nand elsewhere; other species occurred, and so no definite opinion\r\nexisted as to the actual biter, but some people took _R. personatus_\r\nactually biting. It was first described as a parasite of man in America\r\nby Walsh and Riley.[371]\r\n\r\n[370] “Insects to which the name ‘Kissing-bug’ became applied during\r\nthe summer of 1899,” _Bull._ 22 (N.S.), _U.S. Dept.

Med._, April 2, 1906,\r\np. 97) as not only feeding on ticks, such as _Ornithodorus moubata_,\r\nbut as also attacking man. It is called by the Angola Bantus the\r\nochindundu. It is black in colour; the first two pairs of legs are of\r\na bright red hue. It has curious paddle-like structures on the front\r\nfour legs, which seem to be designed for securely holding the ticks.\r\nIt infects native kraals for the sake of preying on ticks. The natives\r\nalso state that it inflicts a bite which far exceeds in painfulness\r\nthat of the tick. They compare the bite with that of a poisonous snake.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Lygæidæ.*\r\n\r\n  Scutellum short; antennæ four-jointed; ocelli present; membranous\r\n  part of hemielytra with never more than five nervures.

The bite is undoubtedly worse than that\r\nof Cimex; cosmopolitan. In colour it is ferruginous, shining, legs\r\ntestaceous; hemielytra slightly shorter and narrower than the abdomen;\r\nmembranous portion transparent, the apex broadly fuscous.

The skin at the site of the bite sloughs away, and generally\r\n  leaves a large deep cavity, which heals very slowly.”\r\n\r\n[374] _Bull. Ent.

I have seen cases of ulcers on various parts of\r\n  the body, for which the ‘nantundua’ was assigned as the cause.” He\r\n  then describes the destruction of the superficial layers of the skin\r\n  which he observed after the yellow fluid had been on the skin twelve\r\n  hours.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n[375] _Ibid._, 1911, ii, pt. 2, p. 180.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder. *Coleoptera.*\r\n\r\n  The larvæ of beetles, similarly to those of some other _Arthropoda_\r\n  (myriapods and the larvæ of gnats), have sometimes been observed\r\n  in man as purely accidental guests. In one case or another, such\r\n  accounts may have originated through a mistake of the observer. Thus\r\n  English doctors report the presence of the larvæ of _Blaps mortisaga_\r\n  in the stools of human beings, Sandberg of the larva of _Agrypnus\r\n  murinus_ in his ten year old son, and Blanchard mentions the larva of\r\n  a beetle that was vomited by a child. All these cases, however, do\r\n  not represent actual parasitism, although there are beetles living\r\n  parasitically.[376]\r\n\r\n[376] [Dr. Daniels has sent me a small coleopterous larva found in an\r\nabscess on a man in British Guiana.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n\r\n*Silvanus surinamensis*, Linnæus (Saw-toothed Grain Beetle).\r\n\r\n[Taschenberg records this beetle as having invaded some sleeping\r\napartments adjoining a brewery where stores were kept, and annoying the\r\nsleepers at night by nipping them when in their beds.\r\n\r\n[This beetle is common in many parts of the world amongst groceries,\r\ncorn, meal, seeds, dried fruits, etc. It is about 1/10 in. long, much\r\nflattened and chocolate-brown in colour. The thorax has two shallow\r\ngrooves and bears six minute teeth on each side. The jaws are strong,\r\nbut the bite cannot be very serious.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder. *Diptera* or *Siphonaptera*.\r\n\r\n*Aphaniptera* (Fleas).\r\n\r\n  Wingless, the thoracic rings distinct and free; antennæ of three\r\n  segments; legs very powerful; abdomen with nine segments. [Ten\r\n  segments are present, but only nine are visible.--F. V. T.] The\r\n  mandibles transformed into serrated puncturing organs, which are\r\n  situated in the split sheath of the rostrum; the maxillæ are\r\n  laminated and have palpi, and more or less conceal the other parts.\r\n\r\n  The importance of fleas lies mainly in the fact that they act as\r\n  plague carriers. About 150 species have already been described. The\r\n  only ones of importance for this work are those found on man and\r\n  those on rats and mice. The two families in which these are found are\r\n  known as _Pulicidæ_ and _Sarcopsyllidæ_.\r\n\r\n  The eggs of fleas are laid on the ground, on rugs, etc., and in\r\n  birds’ and rodents’ nests. They hatch rapidly in warm weather and in\r\n  warm climates, varying from two to five days; in cold countries they\r\n  may take two or three weeks to incubate.\r\n\r\n  The larva is a footless creature, pearly white in colour, the head\r\n  sometimes being darkened, composed of fourteen segments including\r\n  the head, and although apodal can move with considerable agility. It\r\n  lives amongst dust and dirt, and feeds upon any organic matter it can\r\n  find. In about two weeks it is said to become mature, and then spins\r\n  a cocoon in which pupation takes place.\r\n\r\n  The cocoons of the common human flea and the fowl flea become covered\r\n  with dust and dirt. The period of pupal life seems varied, for I have\r\n  had the fowl flea hatch out in ten days, and others in three weeks at\r\n  the same time of year.\r\n\r\n  The adults are blood suckers and cause considerable irritation as\r\n  well as acting as disease carriers, and in the _Sarcopsyllidæ_ the\r\n  females attach themselves permanently to their hosts, embedding\r\n  themselves under the skin, where they become pregnant. Some kinds\r\n  harbour the cystic stage of tapeworms, and the rat trypanosome passes\r\n  certain stages in the rat flea. Most fleas have definite hosts, but\r\n  some, like the rat and fowl fleas, attack man.\r\n\r\n  The fleas which can carry the bacillus of plague are _Xenopsylla\r\n  cheopis_, _Pulex irritans_, _Ceratophyllus fasciatus_ and\r\n  _Hoplopsyllus anomalus_.\r\n\r\n  The two families, _Pulicidæ_ and _Sarcopsyllidæ_, can be\r\n  distinguished as follows:\r\n\r\n    Thoracic segments much foreshortened, coxæ and\r\n      femora of hind legs very slightly enlarged      _Sarcopsyllidæ_.\r\n\r\n    Thoracic segments normal, coxæ and femora of all\r\n      the legs much enlarged                          _Pulicidæ_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Sarcopsyllidæ* (Jiggers).\r\n\r\n  The members of this family are not confined to one host.\r\n\r\n  Three genera are known and tabulate as follows:--\r\n\r\n    α. Hind coxa without a patch of spines on\r\n         the inside.\r\n\r\n    α^1. Hind femur simple                         1. _Dermatophilus._\r\n    α^2.

Hind coxa with a patch of short spines on\r\n         the inside                                3. _Echidnophaga._\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Dermatophilus*, Guérin.\r\n\r\n*Dermatophilus cæcata*, Enderl.\r\n\r\n  The eyes of the female vestigial.

Eyes distinct. The males\r\nonly occasionally visit man to bite; the fertilized female, on the\r\nother hand, bores into the skin with her head, particularly about the\r\ntoes of the host, and then attains considerable dimensions. The eggs\r\ndevelop on the soil with a metamorphosis similar to that of the common\r\nflea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 380.--_Dermatophilus penetrans_: young female.\r\nHighly magnified. (After Moniez.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 381.--_Dermatophilus penetrans_: older female.\r\nEnlarged. (After Moniez.)]\r\n\r\n  The sand flea (nigua) particularly infests Central and South America,\r\n  and, in 1873, was carried by ships from Brazil to the West Coast of\r\n  Africa. In a comparatively short time it has become disseminated\r\n  throughout Africa and has also appeared in Madagascar; recently also\r\n  it has been reported from China.\r\n\r\n  Besides attacking man, it also settles on mammals, for instance, on\r\n  dogs, pigs, etc. According to Jullien the wound or little swelling\r\n  caused by the female has no particular significance, as children\r\n  infested with ten or eleven sand fleas quietly proceeded with their\r\n  games. It will be understood, however, that the wound easily affords\r\n  the opportunity for the setting up of inflammation or even septic\r\n  processes, as is the case in any kind of wound.\r\n\r\n  [The jigger is also well known in the West Indies.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Echidnophaga*, Olliff.\r\n\r\n  Four species found on rats, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Echidnophaga gallinacea*, Westwood (Chigoe of Fowls).\r\n\r\n[This flea is a native of tropical Asia and Africa.

Enlarged. (After Railliet.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 384.--_Pulex serraticeps._ 22/1.]\r\n\r\n  Fleas live in human dwellings all over the world, and periodically\r\n  pass on to persons to suck their blood. They may deposit their\r\n  eggs on very uncleanly individuals, and even undergo development,\r\n  therefore it is possible to find larvæ and pupæ on such persons.\r\n\r\n  The dog flea, _Pulex serraticeps_, is easily distinguished from the\r\n  flea of man by the large thick bristles on the posterior margin of\r\n  the first thoracic ring (fig. 384).\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Xenopsylla*, Glink.\r\n\r\n*Xenopsylla cheopis*, Rothschild.\r\n\r\nThis is the common rat flea of tropical countries. Rothschild[377]\r\nsays: “Although practically cosmopolitan, it cannot apparently flourish\r\nin temperate and cold climates.”\r\n\r\n[377] _Bull. Ent. Res._, 1911, i, pt. 2, p. 92.\r\n\r\nIn the male the bristles of the flap-like process of the clasper all\r\nslender; in the female the narrow portion of the receptaculum seminis\r\nlong. Originally discovered in Egypt.\r\n\r\nThis is apparently the chief plague flea. The Indian Plague Committee\r\nhave proved that this flea is easily infected when fed on plague rats,\r\nand that the bacillus multiplies rapidly in the flea’s stomach and\r\nthat the fleas may remain infective for fifteen days. How the flea\r\ninfects man does not apparently seem to have been proved, as it does\r\nnot do so through its bite, but the excrement is highly infective. It\r\nis probable that this poisoned fæcal matter gets to the wound caused by\r\nthe piercing mouth.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Xenopsylla brasiliensis*, Baker,\r\n\r\noccurs on rats in West Africa and has been introduced into Brazil.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Ctenocephalus*, Kolen.\r\n\r\nIncludes the cat and dog fleas. The dog flea, _C. canis_, Dugès, is\r\nfound on the dog all over the world, but especially in temperate\r\nclimates. It also occurs on rats. Man is often badly bitten by this\r\ninsect and it overruns houses. The eggs are laid on rugs, carpets and\r\ndust and dirt and amongst dogs’ hair, but are not fastened to it and\r\nfall anywhere. The ova may hatch in about fifty hours and the larvæ\r\nlive for seven days and then spin their cocoons amongst dust and dirt.\r\nThe pupal stage lasts about eight days.\r\n\r\nThe cat flea (_C. felis_) is widely distributed over the world, and\r\noccurs on many mammals beyond the cat, and is also found on rats.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Hoplopsyllus*, Baker.\r\n\r\nA genus found in North America related to Pulex, but at once recognized\r\nby the prothorax bearing a comb.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Hoplopsyllus anomalus*, Baker,\r\n\r\nwhich is found on the ground squirrel (_Citellus beecheyi_) in\r\nCalifornia, and according to Rothschild once found on the rat, has been\r\nproved to carry the plague bacillus and to play an important part in\r\nplague infection in California.[378]\r\n\r\n[378] “Report United States Public Health, 1909,” xxiv, No. 29.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Ceratophyllus*, Centis.\r\n\r\n*Ceratophyllus fasciatus*, Bosc.\r\n\r\nThis flea is also found on the rat in Europe and will attack man. It is\r\na plague carrier. It has eighteen to twenty teeth on the prothoracic\r\ncomb and no black spines on the head. The genus Ceratophyllus of Centis\r\nhas a pronotal comb and three ante-pygidial chætæ on each side. Two\r\nother specimens recorded: _C. londiniensis_, Rothsch., and _C. anisus_,\r\nRothsch.

Several others occur\r\non rats and mice. For information concerning these the reader is\r\nreferred to Rothschild’s papers.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Pulex pallipes* is another species found on the rat and man.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Systematic, Anatomical, and Biological Remarks on Mosquitoes.*\r\n\r\n  Mosquitoes come in the _Nematocera_, one of the sub-orders of the\r\n  _Diptera_, and are divided into numerous families, of which, however,\r\n  the _Culicidæ_ are of most interest to us here. Other families as the\r\n  _Psychodidæ_ and _Chironomidæ_ are also of considerable importance,\r\n  _vide_ following pages. The head is small, the facetted eyes are\r\n  placed laterally, but there are no accessory eyes (ocelli). In\r\n  front of the eyes are situated the comparatively long antennæ, the\r\n  differences of which strongly mark the distinction of sex.[379]\r\n\r\n[379] [This is by no means always the case; in the genera Deinocerites,\r\nWyeomyia, Limatus, Theobald, and in Sabethes, Robineau Desvoidy, they\r\nare nearly the same in both sexes.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n  The antennæ are composed of fifteen or sixteen segments. In the male\r\n  they are covered with long whorl-like hairs, while in the female the\r\n  antennal hairs are short--differences that are perceptible even with\r\n  the naked eye.[380] The proboscis, which is longer than the antennæ,\r\n  protrudes from the inferior aspect of the head and is composed of\r\n  the following parts (figs. 387 and 388): Two grooved half tubes,\r\n  facing one another, of which the upper one is the upper lip (labrum)\r\n  and the lower one the lower lip (labium), which represents a pair\r\n  of coalesced maxillæ. Within the tube formed by the labrum and\r\n  labium are the mandibles and maxillæ, transformed into instruments\r\n  for piercing, and a single puncturing organ, the hypopharynx. On\r\n  the right and left, next to the proboscis, are placed the straight\r\n  five-jointed palpi, the final joint of which is thickened in the\r\n  male.[381] In biting, the labrum, which is swollen at its free end,\r\n  is not introduced into the wound like the other mouth parts, but\r\n  is bent backwards. The labium and hypopharynx push direct into the\r\n  skin; the maxillæ and mandibles, however, which are needle-like\r\n  and serrated at the tips, penetrate with a saw-like movement. [The\r\n  swollen free end of the labrum really means the _labellæ_, two\r\n  articulated pieces, supposed by some to be the labial palpi. In most\r\n  species the mandibles are not serrated at their ends.--F. V. T.]\r\n  The saliva is introduced into the wound through the lumen of the\r\n  hypopharynx, while the blood is sucked up by the mosquito in the\r\n  groove of the labium.\r\n\r\n[380] [This is not always the case, _vide_ previous note.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n[381] [This is only so in Anophelina and in the genus Theobaldinella,\r\nNeveu-Lemaire, Grabhamia, Theobald, Acartomyia, Theobald, etc. In true\r\nCulex and many other genera the male palpi are pointed.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n  The three thoracic segments are soldered together. The central one\r\n  carries the membranous wings on the sides of the dorsal surface; the\r\n  posterior somite carries the small halteres (rudimentary posterior\r\n  wings). There are three pairs of long slender legs on the lower side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 385.--Head of a male (_a_) and of a female (_b_)\r\nAnopheles. Slightly enlarged.

(After Nuttall\r\nand Shipley.)]\r\n\r\n  The abdomen has no limbs, is composed of eight (rarely nine) distinct\r\n  segments; the sexual and anal orifices are at the posterior end, the\r\n  stigmata on the sides. The intestinal canal (fig. 389) is composed\r\n  of three principal divisions; the anterior part reaches as far as\r\n  the front pair of legs, and consists of the œsophagus, which is\r\n  provided with two small lateral diverticula. [At the commencement of\r\n  the œsophagus are one or more diverticula, which vary in size; they\r\n  contain air, food and bacteria.--F. V. T.] The mid gut reaches as\r\n  far as the fifth and sixth abdominal ring; in front it is thin, and\r\n  has numerous small supra-œsophageal ganglia; the posterior part is,\r\n  however, more dilated. Four or five Malpighian tubes, the excretory\r\n  organs, discharge at the place where the mid gut passes into the\r\n  terminal gut.\r\n\r\n  The pair of salivary glands have one common excretory duct leading\r\n  into the hypopharynx.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 389.--Longitudinal section of an Anopheles, showing\r\nalimentary canal. In the forepart of the thorax is the salivary gland\r\nconsisting of three tubules; ventrally, the suctorial stomach extending\r\ninto the abdominal cavity; the stomach, and at the posterior end of the\r\nabdomen the Malpighian vessels. (After Grassi.)]\r\n\r\n  These glandular bodies are situated in the thorax; each consists\r\n  of three slightly serpentine tubules, the dorsal and ventral tubes\r\n  being long, the central one shorter. The above-named characteristics\r\n  apply to both genera Culex and Anopheles, but in the genus Culex\r\n  is smaller, Anopheles larger. [In Anopheles the ends of the ducts\r\n  in the lobules are dilated, whilst in most of the genera the ducts\r\n  are the same size all along. The lobules may bifurcate, and in\r\n  Psorophora there are five lobules.--F. V. T.] The legs of the genus\r\n  Culex are about the same length as the whole body; in Anopheles they\r\n  are double that length.[382] In Anopheles the palpi and proboscis\r\n  are of equal length; in Culex the condition is different, according\r\n  to sex. In the male the palpi are longer than the proboscis; in the\r\n  female considerably shorter and the number of segments diminished.\r\n  The venation of the wings exhibits further points of differentiation,\r\n  as also their adornment, though this last sign is not by any means\r\n  always conclusive; most species of the genus Culex have unspotted\r\n  wings, whilst those of Anopheles are usually spotted. More important\r\n  is the fact that in Culex the abdomen is decorated with small scales,\r\n  similar to those on butterflies, whereas there are small bristles on\r\n  the abdomen of Anopheles. [This cannot be said to be a character by\r\n  which an Anopheline may be told from a Culicine, for in such common\r\n  Anopheline genera as Cellia and Neocellia we get plenty of scales\r\n  on the abdomen.--F. V. T.] An experienced observer can, however,\r\n  separate the two genera by the difference in size and their manner\r\n  of resting. When settled they either touch the resting place with\r\n  all the legs or only with the four anterior legs. In consequence\r\n  of the different length of the legs, the body of Culex approaches\r\n  the resting place more closely; moreover, Culex holds the abdomen\r\n  parallel or at an acute angle to the resting surface, whereas\r\n  Anopheles carries the abdomen directed upwards (at an angle of about\r\n  145°) and holds the head down. Both genera, however, usually only\r\n  rest on the four anterior legs, and then, as has long been known,\r\n  Culex carries the third pair directed towards the dorsum, while those\r\n  of Anopheles hang down.\r\n\r\n[382] [This is certainly not always the case.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n  In regard to the differentiation of the species, I must refer you\r\n  to the special literature, and content myself by observing that\r\n  about 150 species of Culex and about fifty species of Anopheles have\r\n  been described, of which fifty about four are found in Europe.\r\n  [The number of known Anophelines now is more--100 species--of other\r\n  Culicidæ over 700.--F. V. T.] According to our present knowledge it\r\n  appears that the entire genus Anopheles can transmit malaria to man;\r\n  this observation has been confirmed in _Anopheles claviger_, Fabr.;\r\n  _A. maculipennis_, Meig.; _A. bifurcatus_, L.; _A. superpictus_,\r\n  Grassi; _A. pseudopictus_, Gr., all of which are found in Italy,[383]\r\n  Germany, etc., as well as in the tropics. Moreover, in _A. costalis_,\r\n  Loew; _A. funestus_, Giles (Africa); _A. quadrimaculatus_, Say (North\r\n  America), and _A. rossii_, Giles; the latter is perhaps identical\r\n  with _A. superpictus_, Gr., as well as with _A. culicifacies_\r\n  (India). [_Anopheles maculipennis_ and _A. claviger_ are the same.\r\n  Certainly neither _maculipennis_ nor _bifurcatus_ has been found\r\n  in the tropics. _Anopheles quadrimaculatus_, Say, is the same as\r\n  _A. maculipennis_. There is no evidence that _all_ Anophelines\r\n  carry malaria, but there is much to show that certain species\r\n  only are capable of so doing. A list of known carriers is given\r\n  later.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n[383] Compare Ficalbi, E., “Venti spec. di zanzare (_Culicidæ_)\r\nital...,” _Bull.

Enlarged.\r\n(After Grassi.)]\r\n\r\n  Everyone is aware that mosquitoes swarm at sunset in fine weather,\r\n  and then seek out human beings and other warm-blooded animals to take\r\n  food. In this regard, however, the sexes differ, for it is almost\r\n  without exception that the females only suck blood, while the males\r\n  subsist on the juices of plants (blossoms or fruits).[384] After\r\n  sucking, and when night has fallen, the mosquitoes find a place of\r\n  refuge, for which purpose they utilize the grasses or foliage of\r\n  trees and bushes, or inhabited or uninhabited rooms of houses, also\r\n  cellars, stables, verandahs, etc., where they also pass the day.\r\n\r\n[384] Both males and females may be kept alive in captivity for a long\r\ntime if given fruits, or even only sugar and water.\r\n\r\n  [Some mosquitoes bite in the daytime--Stegoymia and some Anophelines;\r\n  some bite right into the night, as _Culex fatigans_ and _C.\r\n  pipiens_.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n  The period required for digestion varies according to the\r\n  temperature. It takes two days in summer, and may take up to ten days\r\n  or more in cool weather. After digestion is complete more food is\r\n  taken up, this being necessary [in some species only--F. V. T.] for\r\n  the maturing of the sexual products in the female.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 391.--Larva of _Anopheles maculipennis_, Fabr.\r\nEnlarged. (After Grassi.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 392.--Larva of Culex. Enlarged. (After Grassi.)]\r\n\r\n  It is still unknown under what circumstances copulation takes\r\n  place;[385] in any case, sooner or later the females are fecundated,\r\n  and when the ova have become mature, and the season is not too far\r\n  advanced, they seek a suitable place in which to deposit them.[386]\r\n  These are larger or smaller, permanent or temporary, collections of\r\n  standing water, pools, puddles, lakes, pits, water in rain-water\r\n  barrels, basins, etc. Nevertheless, certain kinds prefer certain\r\n  waters; thus _Anopheles_ (_claviger_) _maculipennis_ and several of\r\n  the Culices seek stagnant water overgrown with swamp vegetation and\r\n  decomposing vegetable matter; _A. bifurcatus_ and certain Culices,\r\n  clear water with some vegetation (such as fountains and the lakes in\r\n  gardens and parks); _Culex pipiens_ has a preference for rain-water\r\n  barrels, even though the water be dirty and evil-smelling. [I have\r\n  found the larvæ of _Anopheles bifurcatus_ living in great numbers in\r\n  ponds and lakes completely overgrown with floating water-weeds, and\r\n  those of _Culex pipiens_ in liquid manure.\r\n\r\n[385] The act of copulation in many species is now known. The female\r\nCulex has three receptaculæ seminalis, while the female Anopheles has\r\none receptaculum seminis.\r\n\r\n[386] It is certain that the females perish immediately after\r\ndepositing the ova; but this does not always hold good, as a part of\r\nthem survive for a few days. The males die soon after copulation.\r\n\r\n  _Sexual Organs of the Mosquito._--The female has a pair of ovaries,\r\n  opening into a single tube by the ovarian tubes; into the single tube\r\n  opens a duct coming from the spermathecæ, and also a mucous gland.\r\n  The spermathecæ store up the male cells. The male organs consist of\r\n  two testes joined by ducts (vasa deferentia) to the ejaculatory duct\r\n  formed by their union. Each vas deferens is joined by a short tube\r\n  with the sac-like vesicula seminalis.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n  There is also a difference in the manner in which Culex and Anopheles\r\n  deposit their ova. Culex deposits two to three hundred eggs in\r\n  compact heaps that float on the water, and in which the eggs stand\r\n  perpendicularly one next the other; whereas _Anopheles maculipennis_\r\n  deposits only three or four up to twenty eggs, united in groups that\r\n  float horizontally on the water; the eggs of _A. bifurcatus_, again,\r\n  are arranged in star-like groups. The eggs are about 0·75 mm. in\r\n  length, and assume a dark hue soon after being laid. The development\r\n  only occupies a few days. The young larvæ grow rapidly, changing\r\n  their integument several times; the larvæ also differ in the various\r\n  genera, though they have a general resemblance (figs. 391 and 392).\r\n\r\n  The long legless larva has a flattened head, a fairly broad,\r\n  rectangular, or trapeziform thorax, on which there are bristles, and\r\n  an abdomen distinctly segmented, and on the segments of which there\r\n  are also lateral bristles. The situation of the stigmata marks the\r\n  difference between the two genera. Though in both genera the stigmata\r\n  are at the posterior end and on the dorsal surface, they are in\r\n  Anopheles close to the surface of the body; in Culex, however, they\r\n  are on the free end of a long tube (siphon).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 393.--Pupa of _Anopheles maculipennis_, Meig.\r\nEnlarged. (After Grassi.)]\r\n\r\n  The position of the larva in the water also differs. The larva of\r\n  Anopheles lies almost horizontally beneath the surface of the water,\r\n  the posterior border of the penultimate abdominal segment, upon which\r\n  the stigmata are situated, being on the surface; whereas the larva of\r\n  Culex hangs head downwards perpendicularly in the water, the point of\r\n  the siphon only touching the surface.\r\n\r\n  In about a fortnight the larva is fully grown and becomes a pupa.\r\n  The pupa (fig. 393), which moves in jerky movements, remains in the\r\n  water, but partakes of no food. In shape it somewhat resembles a\r\n  tadpole, that is to say, it consists of a bulky anterior portion, on\r\n  the surface of which the head, with its appendages, is recognizable,\r\n  and a more slender segmented abdomen. Above, on the thorax, there are\r\n  two small trumpet-shaped breathing tubes for the conveyance of air to\r\n  the tracheal system. After three or four days the perfect mosquito\r\n  hatches out, remains a short time on the surface of the water until\r\n  its chitinous integument is hardened, and then flies away.\r\n\r\n  The females that are fertilized in the autumn hibernate in sheltered\r\n  spots in the open air, or in houses, cellars, under stairs, in\r\n  stables, barns, etc., and are the progenitors of the first generation\r\n  of the following year.\r\n\r\n  In accordance with the climate of a country, or the kind of weather\r\n  of a year, the conditions in regard to the manner of life and the\r\n  duration of the development of the mosquito vary. At all events,\r\n  the life-history of the mosquito elucidates many points relating to\r\n  malaria which were hitherto not understood.\r\n\r\n  [The length of the egg, larval and pupal life varies so much that it\r\n  is not possible to give an account of any value here. Frequently the\r\n  eggs may incubate in two days, whilst I have had _Stegomyia fasciata_\r\n  eggs from Cuba that have hatched out under abnormal circumstances\r\n  more than two months after they were laid (“Mono. Culicid.,” iii,\r\n  p. 6). Some larvæ, as _Anopheles bifurcatus_, live for months during\r\n  the winter. Some mosquitoes therefore hibernate as larvæ. The larvæ\r\n  and pupæ of the different genera present very marked characters,\r\n  mainly in regard to the structure of the siphons. Specific\r\n  differences may be found in the frontal hairs of Anopheline larvæ and\r\n  in the number and arrangement of a group of spines at the base of the\r\n  siphon in Culicines.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n\r\n*Culicidæ or Mosquitoes.*\r\n\r\n  The importance of these insects to man is very great. They not only\r\n  produce painful bites, which may become inflamed and give rise to a\r\n  considerable amount of œdema, but they are more important on account\r\n  of the part they play in the distribution of various diseases.\r\n  _Culicidæ_ may not only carry disease germs, but act as intermediate\r\n  hosts for certain parasites, such as some of the _Anophelina_ for\r\n  malarial parasites, Culex for Filariæ, and Stegomyia for yellow\r\n  fever, etc.; the last-named is in any case the distributor of\r\n  that fatal disease. It is therefore very necessary to know the\r\n  life-history, habits and characters of these pests.\r\n\r\n  Mosquitoes exist in almost all parts of the world from the Arctic\r\n  circle to the tropics; temperate regions suffer from them less than\r\n  the two extremes, but even there they form not only a source of great\r\n  annoyance but of danger as malaria and possibly now and again yellow\r\n  fever carriers. A few years ago comparatively few species were known,\r\n  now some 800 odd have been described. Their number will probably not\r\n  stop far short of 1,000, in spite of the fact that many have been\r\n  described under different names, yet really the same species. Some\r\n  are purely domestic, others entirely sylvan; the former, as we might\r\n  expect, often have a very wide distribution, having been taken from\r\n  place to place in boats and trains. The more rapid transport becomes,\r\n  the greater becomes the possibility of this wide distribution of\r\n  many species increasing, and the spread of other species from their\r\n  natural home to foreign parts by sea and then by trains further\r\n  inland.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 394.--Heads of Culex and Anopheles: (1) Culex\r\n  male; (2) Culex female; (3) Anopheles male; (4) Anopheles female.\r\n  (After Daniels.)]\r\n\r\n  All _Culicidæ_ are aquatic in their larval and pupal stages. Almost\r\n  all small collections of water, both natural and artificial, may\r\n  form breeding grounds for these pests. Some even breed in pitcher\r\n  plants and many in bromelias. The favourite resorts for the larvæ\r\n  of Anophelina are small natural collections of water, such as\r\n  puddles, ditches and small pools around swamps; certain species (_A.\r\n  maculipennis_, etc.) live in rain barrels as well. They may also\r\n  occur in the sluggish water at the edges of rivers or even in mid\r\n  river, where the flow is checked by masses of water weeds (_Myzomyia\r\n  funesta_, etc.). The Stegomyias prefer artificial collections of\r\n  water, but also occur in natural pools. The yellow fever species\r\n  (_S. fasciata_) prefers small collections, such as in barrels, pots,\r\n  jars, etc. Culex occur in all manner of places--rain barrels, tanks,\r\n  cisterns, ponds and ditches. Some of the South American species of\r\n  Culex, Wyeomyia, Joblotia, etc., breed in the collections of water\r\n  at the base of bromelia leaves.[387] Very few Culicid larvæ live in\r\n  salt water except in Australia, where Dr. Bancroft has found them in\r\n  salt water of specific gravity 1·040 (_Mucidus alternans_ and _Culex\r\n  annulirostris_). Other salt water mosquitoes are known in America.\r\n  The food of the larvæ is very varied; the majority appear to feed\r\n  upon confervæ, small crustacea and insects; some are cannibals,\r\n  readily devouring others of their own kind. The larger larvæ of\r\n  Megarhinus, Psorophora, Toxorhynchites and Mucidus are extremely\r\n  ravenous and devour one another.\r\n\r\n[387] “Wald Mosquitoes und Wald Malaria,” Dr. Lutz, _Centralbl. f.\r\nBakt., Par., u. Infektionsk._, i Abt. Orig., xxxiii, No. 4.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 395.--_a_, eggs of Culex; _b_^1 _b_^2, eggs of\r\nAnopheles; _c_, egg of Stegomyia; _d_, egg of Tæniorhynchus; _e_, egg\r\nof Psorophora.]\r\n\r\n  There are two main types of larvæ, the Anopheline and Culicine;\r\n  in the former there is no respiratory siphon, in the latter the\r\n  siphon is long or moderately long. The head offers certain marked\r\n  peculiarities which are of specific value; this especially applies\r\n  to the _Anophelina_, in which the frontal hairs are of great\r\n  service in distinguishing the larvæ,[388] whilst in Culex the\r\n  number and position of the spines at the base of and on the siphon\r\n  are characteristic. The position assumed by the larvæ in the water\r\n  also varies in the different groups; most of the Anophelines lie\r\n  horizontally, most of the _Culicina_ and _Ædeomyina_ hang head\r\n  downwards. The pupæ also vary, but not to the same extent; the chief\r\n  differences to be noticed are in the form of the two respiratory\r\n  trumpets.\r\n\r\n[388] Information sent me by Dr. Grabham shows this statement to be not\r\nquite correct, as the frontal hairs may vary in different stages of the\r\nsame larva. This he has shown in _Cellia albipes_, Theob., and I have\r\nnoticed it in a Nyssorhynchus from Africa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 396.--Diagram showing the structure of a typical\r\nmosquito. (Theobald.)]\r\n\r\n  The eggs, which may be laid separately (_Anopheles maculipennis_,\r\n  _Stegomyia fasciata_, _Joblotia nivipes_, etc.), or in rafts\r\n  (_Culex pipiens_, _C. fatigans_) or in chains (_Pseudotæniorhynchus\r\n  fasciolatus_), present a great variety of forms. The most peculiar\r\n  are shown in fig. 395 (Tæniorhynchus, Culex, Stegomyia, Anopheles,\r\n  Psorophora).\r\n\r\n  As in all insects, they differ very materially in each species of one\r\n  genus. Those best known are the Anopheline eggs.\r\n\r\n  The eggs always float on the surface of the water; immersion soon\r\n  destroys them, but many may occur in mud and can resist desiccation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 397.--Types of scales, _a_ to _k_; head and\r\nscutellar ornamentation, 1 to 5; forms of clypeus, 6.

The labial palpi are very variable in\r\n  regard to their form and the number of segments; in the _Anophelina_\r\n  they are long in both sexes, as long or nearly so as the proboscis,\r\n  more or less clubbed in the males; in _Culicina_, _Joblotina_ and\r\n  _Heptaphlebomyia_, they are long in the males, short in the females;\r\n  in _Ædeomyina_, short in both sexes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 398.--Neuration of Wing. _Explanation of Wing,\r\nVeins and Cells._--A, costal cell; B, sub-costal cell; C, marginal\r\ncell; D, first sub-marginal cell (= first fork cell); E, second\r\nsub-marginal cell; F, first posterior cell; G, second posterior cell (=\r\nsecond fork cell); H, first basal cell; I, second basal cell; J, third\r\nposterior cell; K, anal cell; L, auxiliary cell; M, spurious cell; _c_,\r\ncostal vein; 1_st_--6_th_, first to sixth longitudinal veins; _a_, _a_′\r\nand _a_′′, incrassations (_a_′ called by Austen the sixth vein, _a_′′\r\nthe eighth vein); y, supernumerary cross vein; z, mid cross vein; _p_,\r\nposterior cross vein; _s.c._, sub-costal. (Theobald.)]\r\n\r\n  _Scales_.--The most important structural peculiarities in _Culicidæ_\r\n  are the scales, which form the chief and most readily observed\r\n  characters for separating genera and species. The importance of scale\r\n  structure has been recently ignored by some workers, who are probably\r\n  right academically, but as a means of separating groups, and so more\r\n  easily running down a species, the practical man is strongly advised\r\n  to follow this method. As to what a genus is, is purely a matter\r\n  of personal opinion. If one examines any recent standard work on\r\n  entomology one will find a species being placed in varied genera by\r\n  the varied authorities.\r\n\r\n  The head, thorax, abdomen and wings are in nearly all cases clothed\r\n  with squamæ of varied form, of which the following are the main types\r\n  (fig. 397):--\r\n\r\n    (1) Flat, spade-shaped scales (_a_).\r\n    (2) Narrow curved scales (_e_).\r\n    (3) Hair-like curved scales (_d_).\r\n    (4) Spindle-shaped scales (_f_).\r\n    (5) Small spindle-shaped scales (_g_).\r\n    (6) Upright forked scales (_h_) and (_i_).\r\n    (7) Twisted upright scales (_j_).\r\n    (8) Inflated or pyriform scales (_k_).\r\n    (9) Mansonia scales (_b_).\r\n    (10) Small broad asymmetrical scales (_c_).\r\n\r\n    Various other varieties are found on the wings, such as:--\r\n    (1) Narrow linear lateral scales.\r\n    (2) Narrow lanceolate scales.\r\n    (3) Broad lanceolate scales.\r\n    (4) Elongated, broad, truncated scales (= Pseudotæniorhynchus-like\r\n          scales).\r\n    (5) Pyriform scales.\r\n    (6) Asymmetrical broad or Tæniorhynchus scales.\r\n    (7) Flat spade-like scales.[389]\r\n\r\n[389] Heart-shaped scales occur on the wings of Etiorleptiomyia.\r\n\r\n  The wings have a series of scales along the middle line of the veins,\r\n  and also lateral scales to all or nearly all the veins. The wing\r\n  is also fringed by a series of scales (fig. 396), which, however,\r\n  are of little systematic importance; the so-called “border scales”\r\n  (b.s.) vary, however, to some extent, and are useful characters in\r\n  separating some of the Tæniorhynchus.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CLASSIFICATION OF _Culicidæ_.\r\n\r\n  SECTION A.--Proboscis formed for piercing; metanotum nude.\r\n              Scutellum simple.\r\n    I.

Beschr. Europ. zwei. Ins. I,” 1818, ii, p. 2, Meigen; “Mono.\r\n  Culicid.,” 1903, i, p. 191; iii, p. 17; and 1910, v, p. 3, Theobald.\r\n\r\n  This genus contains a few large species found either in temperate\r\n  climates or in hills and mountains of warm climates. The type is the\r\n  European and North American _A. maculipennis_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 399.--Wing of _Anopheles maculipennis_, Meigen.]\r\n\r\n  _A. maculipennis_, Meigen. This species and _A. bifurcatus_ are\r\n  malaria carriers. True Anopheles only occur in Europe, North America,\r\n  the North of Africa and in the mountains of India, and one has been\r\n  found by Bancroft similar to _A. bifurcatus_ in Queensland. They are\r\n  easily told by the absence of scales on thorax and abdomen, and by\r\n  the rather densely scaled wings with lanceolate scales.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Myzomyia*, Blanchard; *Grassia*, Theobald.\r\n\r\n  _Comp. rend. heb. Soc. Biol._, No. 23, p. 795, Blanchard; “Mono.\r\n  Culicid.,” 1910, iii, p. 24; v, p. 16, Theobald.\r\n\r\n  This genus occurs in Asia, Africa and South America, Europe and East\r\n  Indies. The type is _M. funesta_, Giles, found in Central and West\r\n  Africa. Although structurally there is not much difference between\r\n  this genus and Anopheles, they differ greatly in appearance, and\r\n  there are usually a few narrow curved thoracic scales projecting over\r\n  the head, whilst the wing scales are much smaller in proportion,\r\n  and the wings more uniformly spotted, always so along the costa.\r\n  _Funesta_ and _lutzii_ are undoubtedly malaria bearers and also\r\n  _rossii_.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Neomyzomyia*, Theobald.\r\n\r\n  “Mono. Culicid.,” 1910, v, p. 29.\r\n\r\n  A single species only occurs in this genus, _N. elegans_, James, from\r\n  India. In this genus, which is near to Myzomyia, the fourth long vein\r\n  is very near the base of the third, and there are outstanding scales\r\n  on the prothoracic lobes, and there is a marked tuft of dense scales\r\n  at the posterior angles of the head.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Cycloleppteron*, Theobald.\r\n\r\n  “Mono. Culicid.,” 1903, ii, p. 312; 1903, iii, p. 58; 1910, v, p. 33.\r\n\r\n  Two common species only occur in this genus, _C. grabhamii_, Theob.,\r\n  from Jamaica, and _C. mediopunctatus_, Theob. (Lutz., ms.), from\r\n  South America. The chief character is the presence of large black\r\n  inflated pyriform scales on the wings. The palpi are densely scaled.\r\n  Neither have been shown to be malaria bearers.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Feltinella*, Theobald.\r\n\r\n  “Mono. Culicid.,” 1907, iv, p. 56.\r\n\r\n  A single species, so far only found in this genus. The basal lobes of\r\n  the male genitalia of two segments, the prothoracic lobes with dense\r\n  outstanding scales.\r\n\r\n  The species, _F. pallidopalpi_, Theob., occurs in Sierra Leone.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Stethomyia*, Theobald.\r\n\r\n  “Mono. Culicid.,” 1903, iii, p. 13; 1907, iv, p. 59; 1910, v, p. 35.\r\n\r\n  Four species occur in this marked genus--one _S. nimba_, Theob., from\r\n  British Guiana and Para, another _S. fragalis_, Theob., from the\r\n  Malay States, _S. culiciformis_, James and Liston, from India, and\r\n  _S. pallida_, Ludlow, from India.\r\n\r\n  The former may be a malaria carrier, for Dr. Low says: “Malarial\r\n  fever is got amongst the Indians and often of a severe type. In\r\n  that connection it is interesting that in the interior, at a place\r\n  called Corato, I got an entirely new Anopheles in large numbers.” The\r\n  genus is easily told by its unornamented wings, flat head scales,\r\n  mammillated prothoracic lobes and long thin legs.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Pyretophorus*, Blanchard; *Howardia*, Theobald.\r\n\r\n  _Compt. rend. heb. Soc. Biol._, No. 23, p. 705, Blanchard; _Journ.\r\n  Trop. Med._, v, p. 181; and “Mono. Culicid.,” 1903, iii, p. 13; 1910,\r\n  v, p. 36, Theobald.\r\n\r\n  Forty-four species come in this genus, of which _Anopheles costalis_,\r\n  Loew, is the type.\r\n\r\n  This genus is found in Africa, India, Europe and in Australia. Three\r\n  species are proved malaria bearers, namely, _P. costalis_, Loew, _P.\r\n  chaudoyei_, Theob., and _P. superpictus_, Grassi. Members of this\r\n  genus can be told by having narrow curved thoracic scales, hairy\r\n  abdomen, and much-spotted wings.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Myzorhynchella*, Theobald.\r\n\r\n  “Mono. Culicid.,” 1907, iv, p. 78.\r\n\r\n  In this genus the thorax has distinct, narrow curved scales, and the\r\n  abdomen is hairy, the wing scales broad and lanceolate, and the head\r\n  with broad scales not closely appressed, but not forked or fimbriated.\r\n\r\n  Five species are known: _lutzi_, Cruz; _parva_, Chagas;\r\n  _nigritarsis_, Chagas; _tibiomaculata_, Neiva; _gilesi_, Neiva; and\r\n  _nigra_, Theobald. They are all recorded from Brazil, and _nigra_\r\n  also from Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Manguinhosia*, Cruz, in Peryassu.\r\n\r\n  “Os Culicideos do Brazil,” 1908, p. 112.\r\n\r\n  A single marked species from the Brazils. The thorax has piliform\r\n  curved scales, and some narrow curved and flattened ones on the\r\n  sides. Abdomen pilose, except the last three segments which are\r\n  scaled. No tufts of scales on posterior femora.\r\n\r\n  Allied to Lophoscelomyia, but at once told by the absence of scale\r\n  tufts on the hind femora. _M. lutzi_, Cruz, Brazil.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Chrystya*, Theobald.\r\n\r\n  “Rep. Sleeping Sickness, Roy. Soc. Eng.,” 1903, vii, p. 34.\r\n\r\n  A very marked genus in which the hairy abdomen has very long, dense,\r\n  hair-like, apical, scaly tufts to the segments. A single species only\r\n  so far known, _C. implexa_, Theobald, from Africa (Uganda, Sudan,\r\n  etc.).\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Lophoscelomyia*, Theobald.\r\n\r\n  _Entomologist_, 1904, xxxvi, p. 12.\r\n\r\n  A single species only, from the Federated Malay States. The hind\r\n  femora have dense, apical scale tufts; the thorax long, hair-like\r\n  curved scales; abdomen pilose, except the last two segments which are\r\n  scaly; wings with broad, blunt, lanceolate scales.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Arribalzagia*, Theobald.\r\n\r\n  “Mono. Culicid.,” 1903, iii, pp. 13 and 81; and 1910, v, p. 48.\r\n\r\n  Two species only occur, found in South America. The thorax and\r\n  abdomen have scales and hairs respectively, as in Pyretophorus, but\r\n  the abdomen has in addition prominent lateral apical scale tufts\r\n  to the segments and a scaly venter. Wings with membrane tinged in\r\n  patches and wing scales bluntly lanceolate and very dense. The\r\n  type is _A. maculipes_, Theob. found in Trinidad and Brazil; _A.\r\n  pseudomaculipes_, Cruz, also in Brazil.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Myzorhynchus*, Blanchard; *Rossia*, Theobald.\r\n\r\n  _Compt. rend. heb. Soc. Biol._, 1902, No. 23, p. 795, Blanchard;\r\n  _Journ. Trop. Med._, 1902, p. 181, Theobald; “Mono. Culicid.,” 1903,\r\n  iii, p. 84; 1907, iv, p. 80; 1910, v, p. 49.\r\n\r\n  A very marked genus of large, dark, densely scaled species, found\r\n  in Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. The thorax with hair-like\r\n  curved scales; the abdomen with ventral and apical scales, and a\r\n  median ventral apical tuft, and with very densely scaled palpi in\r\n  the female, and densely scaled proboscis. It seems to be mainly an\r\n  Asiatic and East Indian genus, but three species occur in Africa and\r\n  one in Australia. They are mostly sylvan species and bite severely.\r\n\r\n  Fourteen species are known. Five are malaria carriers (_vide_ list,\r\n  p. 566).\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Nyssorhynchus*, Blanchard; *Laverania*, Theobald.\r\n\r\n  “Mono. Culicid.,” 1910, iii, p. 14; v, p. 55, Theobald; _Compt. rend.\r\n  heb. Soc. Biol._, No. 23, p. 795, Blanchard.\r\n\r\n  A group of small, closely allied species found in Asia, Africa and\r\n  Australia, twelve out of the twenty species coming from India.\r\n\r\n  The thorax is covered with narrow curved and spindle-shaped scales,\r\n  abdomen with small, flat or narrow curved dorsal scales, especially\r\n  on the apical segments or in patches; the legs are always banded or\r\n  spotted with white, and the tarsi have as a rule one or more pure\r\n  white segments. (This banding and spotting is of no generic value,\r\n  however.)\r\n\r\n  The species show considerable seasonal variation. The type of the\r\n  genus is _N. maculatus_, Theobald.\r\n\r\n  Three are malaria carriers (_vide_ list, p. 566).\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Cellia*, Theobald.\r\n\r\n  “Mono. Culicid.,” 1903, iii, p. 107; 1910, v, p. 67.\r\n\r\n  Very marked Anophelines, with densely scaly abdomens, the scales\r\n  irregularly disposed on the dorsum and forming dense lateral tufts;\r\n  thorax with flat spindle-shaped scales; palpi densely scaled and also\r\n  the wings.\r\n\r\n  The type of the genus is the African _C. pharoensis_, Theob. It is\r\n  represented in Asia by _C. kochii_, Dönitz; in West Indies and South\r\n  America by _C. argyrotarsis_, Desvoidy, and _C. bigotii_, Theob.; in\r\n  Africa by _C. squamosa_, Theob., etc.\r\n\r\n  _C. argyrotarsis_, Desvoidy, and _C. albimana_, Wiedemann, are\r\n  undoubtedly malaria bearers.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Neocellia*, Theobald.\r\n\r\n  “Mono. Culicid.,” 1907, iv, p. 111.\r\n\r\n  Allied to Cellia, but has no lateral scale tufts. Three species\r\n  recorded from India.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Kertészia*, Theobald.\r\n\r\n  “Ann. Mus. Nat., Hung.,” 1905, iii, p. 66.\r\n\r\n  This genus has the thoracic scales hair-like, except a few narrow\r\n  curved ones in front; abdominal scales long, broad and irregular.\r\n\r\n  A single species, _K. boliviensis_, Theob. from Bolivia.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Manguinhosia*, Cruz.\r\n\r\n  The thorax has narrow hair-like curved scales and some broad straight\r\n  scales; others spatulate on the sides. Abdomen with fine hairs,\r\n  except the last three segments which are scaly. Tufts of scales on\r\n  the hind femora. Wing scales lanceolate.\r\n\r\n  The type is _M. lutzi_, Cruz, from Brazil.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Chagasia*, Cruz.\r\n\r\n  “Brazil-Medico,” 1906, xx, pp. 20, 199.\r\n\r\n  This genus can at once be told by the antennal segments having many\r\n  dense scaly tufts. Type, _C. fajardoi_, Lutz, from Brazil.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Calvertina*, Ludlow.\r\n\r\n  _Canadian Entomologist_, 1909, xli, pp. 22, 234.\r\n\r\n  The antennæ in this genus have outstanding scales on the second\r\n  segment, more appressed ones on the first. At least one abdominal\r\n  segment with long, flat, more or less spatulate scales. Type, _C.\r\n  lineata_, Ludlow, from Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Birónella*, Theobald.\r\n\r\n  “Ann. Mus. Nat. Hung.,” 1905, iii, p. 69.\r\n\r\n  At once told by the first submarginal cell being very small. Type,\r\n  _B. gracilis_, Theob. from New Guinea.\r\n\r\n\r\nSub-family. *Megarhininæ.*\r\n\r\n  Three genera occur in this marked sub-family; they are the largest\r\n  of all mosquitoes, and are very brilliantly coloured, and many have\r\n  tail fans. They occur in North and South America, Asia, Africa, and\r\n  Australia. The long curved proboscis is very marked. They are usually\r\n  spoken of as elephant mosquitoes; some are vicious blood-suckers at\r\n  times.\r\n\r\n  The three genera tabulate as follows:--\r\n\r\n  α. Palpi long in both sexes.\r\n  β. Last segment of ♀ palp round or\r\n       blunt as if broken                Genus _Megarhinus_, R. Desvoidy.\r\n    ββ. Last segment of ♀ palp long\r\n          and pointed                    Genus _Ankylorhynchus_, Lutz.\r\n    αα. Palpi of female short of male\r\n          long.\r\n          Palpi of female not more than\r\n          one-third length of proboscis  Genus _Toxorhynchites_, Theobald.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Megarhinus*, Robineau Desvoidy.\r\n\r\n  “Mém. Soc. d’Hist. nat. de Paris,” 1827, iii, p. 412; “Mono.\r\n  Culicid.,” 1901, i, p. 215; 1903, iv, p. 163; 1907, iv, p. 128; 1910,\r\n  v, p. 89.\r\n\r\n  All large brilliant mosquitoes with long palpi in both sexes and, as\r\n  a rule, with a caudal fan of scales; the proboscis is long and bent.\r\n  They are all sylvan species, and are not so far recorded as biting\r\n  man.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Toxorhynchites*, Theobald.\r\n\r\n  “Mono. Culicid.,” 1901, i, p. 244; 1903, iii, p. 119; 1907, iv,\r\n  p. 140; 1910, v, p. 95.\r\n\r\n  Differs from the former genus in that the female palpi are short. The\r\n  palpi may have one, two or three minute terminal segments. Banks’s\r\n  genus Worcesteria has three.\r\n\r\n  The elephant mosquito of India (_T. immisericors_), Walker, bites\r\n  very severely. They are sylvan species.\r\n\r\n\r\nSub-family. *Culicinæ*.\r\n\r\nGenus. *Mucidus*, Theobald.\r\n\r\n  “Mono. Culicid.,” 1901, i, p. 268; 1910, v, p. 125.\r\n\r\n  This genus is so far confined to Australia, West and Central\r\n  Africa, India, East Indies and Malay Peninsula. They are all large\r\n  mosquitoes, easily told by the whole body being more or less covered\r\n  with long twisted scales, giving them a mouldy appearance, and the\r\n  legs densely scaled with outstanding scales; the wings with large\r\n  parti-coloured scales. The Australian _M. alternans_, Walker, occurs\r\n  in larval form both in fresh and salt water. The adults bite man.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Psorophora*, Robineau Desvoidy.\r\n\r\n  “Mém. de la Soc. d’Hist. nat. de Paris,” 1827, iii, p. 412, R.\r\n  Desvoidy; “Mono. Culicid.,” 1901, i, p. 259; 1903, iii, p. 130; 1907,\r\n  iv, p. 158; 1910, v, p. 123, Theobald.\r\n\r\n  This genus is confined to the Americas and the West Indies. Several\r\n  species exist which can easily be told from Mucidus by the absence\r\n  of long twisted scales and the narrower wing scales. The legs are\r\n  densely scaled and the thorax ornamented with flat spindle-shaped\r\n  scales.\r\n\r\n  _P. ciliata_, Robineau Desvoidy, occurs in both North and South\r\n  America, and bites man.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Janthinosoma*, Arribalzaga.\r\n\r\n  “Dipt. Arg.,” 1891, p. 52, Arribalzaga; “Mono. Culicid.,” 1901, i,\r\n  p. 253; 1903, iii, p. 124; 1907, iv, p. 152; and 1910, v, p. 118,\r\n  Theobald.\r\n\r\n  Hind legs only densely scaled; some of the hind tarsi are always\r\n  white. The venation is as in Culex. The abdomen is metallic and\r\n  iridescent. They all bite man and occur only in the Americas and West\r\n  Indies.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Stegomyia*, Theobald.\r\n\r\n  “Mono. Culicid.,” 1901, i, p. 283; 1903, iii, p. 130; 1907, iv,\r\n  p. 170; 1910, v, p. 151.\r\n\r\n  This, the most important genus in the _Culicinæ_, can be told by the\r\n  head and scutellum being clothed with flat scales and the thorax with\r\n  narrow curved ones.\r\n\r\n  About forty species are known in this genus, occurring in Southern\r\n  Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, the Americas, East and West\r\n  Indies, and on most oceanic islands. Many of them seem to be\r\n  vicious blood-suckers. They are mostly black and white mosquitoes,\r\n  and several seem to go by the name of tiger mosquitoes. The genus\r\n  contains the yellow fever mosquito (_S. fasciata_, Fabricius), the\r\n  only one that need be dealt with in detail here. The chief known\r\n  species tabulate as follows:--\r\n\r\n  A. Proboscis banded.\r\n      α. Legs basally banded.\r\n         Thorax brown, with scattered creamy-\r\n          white scales                           _annulirostris_, Theobald.\r\n         Thorax black, with narrow, curved\r\n          golden scales                          _periskelta_, Giles.\r\n     αα.

It\r\n  is also referred to by some writers as _S. calopus_, Meigen. It\r\n  is subject to considerable variation in colour, but the thoracic\r\n  markings are generally very constant. The general colour is almost\r\n  black to deep brown, the head with a median white area, white at\r\n  the sides and in front around the eyes; the thorax has two median\r\n  parallel yellow lines, a broad curved silvery one on each side and\r\n  white spots at the sides; the scales on the intervening spaces of the\r\n  thorax are brown. The dark abdomen has basal white bands and basal\r\n  white lateral spots. The dark legs have basal white bands, the last\r\n  segment of the hind legs being all white except in a variety from\r\n  South America and the West Indies (_luciensis_), which has the tip of\r\n  the last hind tarsal dark. The abdomen may also vary in colour, some\r\n  having pale scales over most of the surface (_queenslandensis_).\r\n\r\n  The food of the adult female consists mainly of man’s blood, but she\r\n  will also feed on dogs and other animals. The male has been said to\r\n  bite, but such is very unusual. This mosquito bites mainly in the\r\n  daytime up till about 5 p.m.\r\n\r\n  The adults breed the first day after emergence. They may live a\r\n  considerable time, Bancroft having kept females for two months in\r\n  confinement. The ova are laid separately, often in chains; they\r\n  are black, oval, with a reticulated membrane outside, some of the\r\n  reticulated cells containing air. They may hatch in from six to\r\n  twenty hours, the larval stage nine days, the pupal stage three; thus\r\n  the whole cycle may be completed in from twelve to thirteen days.\r\n  The ova when dry can remain undeveloped for a considerable time. The\r\n  larvæ are greyish-white, with short, thick siphon, and feed at the\r\n  bottom of the water, only coming to the surface now and again to\r\n  breathe. This is almost entirely a domesticated gnat, seldom being\r\n  found far from man’s habitations. Its larvæ occur in such small\r\n  collections of water as old sardine tins, jam-pots, calabashes,\r\n  puddles, barrels, wells--in fact, wherever water is held up, even to\r\n  the gutters of houses. Not only are they found breeding on land, but\r\n  also on board ship, although they prefer artificial collections of\r\n  water. They may also breed in larger natural collections.\r\n\r\n  This insect is easily transported by steam and sailing ships and by\r\n  train, and this doubtless explains its very wide distribution. The\r\n  adults may live for fifty days, and it is on this account and their\r\n  frequent occurrence on ships that danger lies in regard to the Panama\r\n  Canal. An infected insect may leave that endemic centre of yellow\r\n  fever and live until the vessel arrived at the Philippine Islands and\r\n  fly ashore, and so introduce the disease for the native _fasciata_\r\n  possibly to spread.\r\n\r\n  Roughly the distribution of this pest is as follows: Africa from\r\n  South to North, but especially along the coast and up the Nile. In\r\n  Asia, in India, Ceylon, Burma, Siam, along the ports of the Malay\r\n  Peninsula, in French Cochin China, Philippine Islands, the Andaman\r\n  and Nicobar Islands, Japan, Malay Archipelago, and East Indies,\r\n  Turkey in Asia, Arabia and Palestine.\r\n\r\n  In Australia it occurs in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and\r\n  South Australia.\r\n\r\n  In Europe in Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, in the Mediterranean\r\n  Islands.\r\n\r\n  In South America, Central America, Mexico, North America, and the\r\n  West Indies it is very abundant, and it also is found in the Bahama\r\n  Islands, Fiji, Sandwich Islands, Samoa, the Azores, Teneriffe and\r\n  Santa Cruz, Pitcairn Islands and Bermuda.\r\n\r\n  For a full account of its distribution the reader is referred to the\r\n  following: “The Distribution of the Yellow Fever Mosquito (_Stegomyia\r\n  fasciata_, Fabricius) and General Notes on its Bionomics;” “Mém.\r\n  1^{er} Congrès international d’Entomologie, 1911, ii, pp. 145–170,\r\n  F. V. Theobald.” In addition to being the yellow fever carrier, it\r\n  is supposed by Wenyon to be the intermediate host of the parasite of\r\n  Bagdad sore.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Stegomyia scutellaris*, Walker.\r\n\r\n  A vicious biter, found in India, China, Malay, East Indies, and\r\n  Ceylon. The thorax has one median silvery stripe, and so can easily\r\n  be told from _S. fasciata_.\r\n\r\n  A very similar species occurs in Fiji, but can be told by the pleuræ\r\n  having white lines, not spots (_S. pseudoscutellaris_, Theobald). It\r\n  is the intermediate host of filaria in Fiji (Bahr).\r\n\r\n  A number of nearly allied genera occur here (_vide_ synoptic table).\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Theobaldia*, Neveu-Lemaire.\r\n\r\n*Theobaldinella*, Blanchard.\r\n\r\n  Includes several large Culicines, of which _T. annulata_, Meigen,\r\n  is the type. The wings are usually spotted (_annulata_, _incidens_,\r\n  etc.), but may be nearly plain (_spathipalpis_). The males have the\r\n  palpi swollen apically, and the females have long five-jointed palps.\r\n\r\n  Several of these are vicious biters.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Theobaldia annulata*, Meigen.\r\n\r\n  This large gnat (6 mm. long) can be told by its wings having five\r\n  large spots of dark scales and by its legs having broad basal white\r\n  bands to the tarsi. The larvæ occur in rain barrels and small pools.\r\n  It is essentially a domestic form, occurring in houses and privies.\r\n  Its distribution is Europe generally and North America. The bite is\r\n  very severe, and in some districts gives rise to painful œdema.[392]\r\n\r\n[392] Theobald, “Second Report on Economic Zoology,” 1903, p. 9.\r\n\r\n  _Theobaldia spathipalpis_, Rondani, occurs in Italy, Mediterranean\r\n  Islands, Palestine, the Himalayas, Khartoum, and in South Africa. It\r\n  is about the same size as _T. annulata_, but is yellowish-brown in\r\n  colour, with striped thorax and mottled and banded legs. It occurs in\r\n  privies and bites very severely.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Culex*, Linnæus.\r\n\r\n  “Syst. Nat. Ed.,” 1758, x, Linnæus; “Mono. Culicid.,” 1901, i,\r\n  p. 326; 1910, v, p. 322, Theobald.\r\n\r\n  This large genus still contains many forms which should be excluded.\r\n  The species normally have narrow curved median head-scales, and\r\n  similar ones on the scutellum; the female palpi are shorter than\r\n  in the former genus and the male palpi are pointed; the lateral\r\n  vein-scales are narrow and linear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 400.--Wing of a Culex.]\r\n\r\n  The type is _Culex pipiens_, Linn., the common gnat of Europe.\r\n  The thorax is covered with narrow curved golden-brown scales,\r\n  the abdomen has basal pale bands to the segments and the legs and\r\n  proboscis are unbanded. The stem of the first submarginal cell is\r\n  always less than one-fifth the length of the cell. It lays its eggs\r\n  in rafts in water-butts, etc., and even in the foulest water. They\r\n  are first deposited in England in June and July, and again soon after\r\n  hatching in August. In some districts this gnat bites man viciously,\r\n  in others not at all.\r\n\r\n  The common tropical gnat (_Culex fatigans_, Wied). This resembles the\r\n  European _Culex pipiens_, but can always be told by the stem of the\r\n  first submarginal cell always being much longer than it is in _C.\r\n  pipiens_. This is one of the species that has been proved to transmit\r\n  filariæ to man, etc. Varieties of it occur in almost every country\r\n  between 40° N. and S., having a very similar range to _S. fasciata_.\r\n  In all countries it appears to be connected with the transmission of\r\n  _Filaria bancrofti_, and it is also said to carry the micrococcus of\r\n  dengue fever.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Melanoconion*, Theobald.\r\n\r\n  “Mono. Culicid.,” 1903, iii, p. 238; 1907, iv, p. 507; 1910, v,\r\n  p. 455.\r\n\r\n  This genus is composed of eight species, most of which are small\r\n  black gnats which bite viciously and which occur in swamps and\r\n  jungles. They can at once be told from Culex by the veins of the\r\n  wings having dense broadened scales on their apical areas and along\r\n  the upper costal border. The femora and apices of the tibiæ are\r\n  swollen.\r\n\r\n  The black mosquito, _Melanoconion atratus_, Theob. This small\r\n  gnat is a very troublesome pest in swamps in the West Indies. The\r\n  female bites both by day and by night, and the bite causes severe\r\n  irritation. The larvæ live in permanent ponds. It is almost black in\r\n  colour, but sometimes presents a dull coppery sheen; each segment has\r\n  small lateral basal white spots. Length 2·5 to 3 mm.\r\n\r\n  It occurs in Para and British Guiana as well as in the West Indies.\r\n\r\n  Ordinary mosquito netting is no use for keeping off this pest.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Grabhamia*, Theobald.\r\n\r\n  “Mono. Culicid.,” 1903, iii, p. 243; 1907, iv, p. 284; and 1910, v,\r\n  p. 277.\r\n\r\n  Allied to Culex, but separated by the wings having short fork-cells,\r\n  mottled scales, the median ones thick and also some of the lateral\r\n  ones short and broad; the last two joints of the male palps are very\r\n  slightly swollen. The eggs are laid singly, not in rafts, and the\r\n  larvæ have short, thick siphons. Ten species occur and are found in\r\n  Europe, North America, West Indies and Natal. _G. dorsalis_, Meigen,\r\n  bites severely in Europe. _G. sollicitans_, Walker, is a great\r\n  scourge along the New Jersey Coast and at Virginia summer resorts\r\n  and in Florida. It breeds in brackish water and is the most common\r\n  mosquito of the Atlantic seaboard.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Pseudotæniorhynchus*, Theobald; *Tæniorhynchus*, Theobald,\r\nnon-Arribalzaga.\r\n\r\n  Differs from the former in having the whole wing veins clothed with\r\n  dense, broadish elongated scales. They occur in South America (_T.\r\n  fasciolatus_, Arri.), in Africa (_T. tenax_, Theob.), in Europe (_T.\r\n  richardii_, Ficalbi). The latter bites very severely.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Tæniorhynchus*, Arribalzaga; *Mansonia*, Blanchard;\r\n*Panoplites*, Theobald.\r\n\r\n  _Compt. rend. heb. Soc.

It occurs in Africa (_T. africana_ and _T. major_, Theob.);\r\n  in Asia (_T. uniformis_, Theob.; _T. annulipes_, Walker, etc.) and in\r\n  Australia (_T. australiensis_); in the Americas and West Indies (_T.\r\n  titillans_, Walker). The eggs (fig. 395, _d_) are peculiar in form\r\n  and are laid separately; the larva has not been described; the pupa\r\n  has long curved siphons. They mostly occur along rivers, in swamps\r\n  and forests, and bite very severely. They also enter houses (_T.\r\n  titillans_). _T. uniformis_ is most troublesome during the rains.\r\n  The saliva is strongly acid. Both these species carry the larvæ of\r\n  _Filaria bancrofti_.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Chrysoconops*, Goeldi.\r\n\r\n  “Os Mosq. no Para,” 1905, p. 114, Goeldi; “Mono.

These insects, which are frequently spoken of as\r\n  sand-flies, are found in all parts of the world; they are all small\r\n  insects varying from 1·5 to 3 mm. The females are very bloodthirsty,\r\n  but the males appear to be incapable of sucking blood.\r\n\r\n  The head sunk under the humped thorax; antennæ short, straight;\r\n  palpi short and broad, of four segments, bent; wings broad and in\r\n  some iridescent, legs stout. The male has holoptic eyes, whilst in\r\n  the female they are small and widely separate. The sucking proboscis\r\n  is short. The thorax and abdomen are clothed with short hairs which\r\n  may form spots and markings; these are golden, silvery, grey, or\r\n  brownish. In the sub-genus Pro-Simulium the second segment of the\r\n  hind tarsi in both sexes is elongate, linear, and without a basal\r\n  notch; in Eu-Simulium it is short, curved, and dorsally notched at\r\n  the base.\r\n\r\n  _Simulidæ_ often occur in swarms, and attack not only man but cattle,\r\n  horses, and poultry. In some districts they are more annoying than\r\n  mosquitoes.\r\n\r\n  Their life-cycle has been most completely worked out by King, in\r\n  Africa.\r\n\r\n  The larvæ and pupæ occur in swiftly flowing water, by waterfalls, in\r\n  rapids, etc. The ova are laid in gelatinous masses on plants or rocks\r\n  close to or overhanging the water. The larva is cylindrical, enlarged\r\n  posteriorly, where it is provided with a sucker, by means of which it\r\n  attaches itself to a rock, water weeds, debris, etc.; anteriorly it\r\n  has a proleg close behind the head on the lower surface. The head is\r\n  dark and chitinous. The respiration takes place by means of branched\r\n  tracheal gills which protrude from the dorsal surface of the last\r\n  body segment; they are retractile. The colour varies from deep green\r\n  to yellow or almost black. Their food consists of algæ and other\r\n  organisms in the water brought to their mouth by two fan-like organs\r\n  placed on the head. The larvæ can crawl from place to place by means\r\n  of the thoracic proleg; they occur in masses, usually in a more or\r\n  less erect attitude. A network of threads is spun on their support,\r\n  by means of which King tells us “they are enabled to maintain their\r\n  position against the strongest current; frequently they will leave\r\n  their support and let themselves out into the stream anchored by\r\n  threads of silk and enabled by them to return.”\r\n\r\n  When full fed the larva spins a pocket-shaped cocoon on the support,\r\n  within which it pupates. The pupa is motionless and has a pair of\r\n  branched spiracles projecting from behind the head. When the adult\r\n  emerges, a bubble of air collects around it, and in this it floats to\r\n  the surface and at once takes wing. The European species take a month\r\n  to complete larval life, a week being spent in the pupal stage. The\r\n  flies are most restless, and even when stationary continually move\r\n  their legs about like feelers. Sometimes the swarms consist entirely\r\n  of females, sometimes early in the season mostly of males.\r\n\r\n  The females pierce the skin of humans on tender spots, such as ears,\r\n  the forehead, around the eyes and nose, and crawl into the cavities.\r\n  They are quite harmless at night, mainly attacking about sunrise and\r\n  sunset. Some crawl up the arms and legs and down the neck, and leave\r\n  behind little red weals which itch intensely (_S. damnosum_, Theob.),\r\n  and blood may flow freely from the wounds.\r\n\r\n  The following are some of the worst species:--\r\n\r\n  _Simulium columbaschensis_, the “Kolumbatz fly,” which abounds in the\r\n  damp marshy lands along the Danube, and is a great plague to man and\r\n  beasts in Hungary, and is also abundant in Austria and Moravia, and\r\n  is most numerous after inundations from the Danube. They sometimes\r\n  appear in such swarms that it is impossible to breathe without\r\n  getting them into one’s mouth. There are instances of children being\r\n  killed by these flies when left on the ground by their mothers when\r\n  working in the fields.\r\n\r\n  _S. damnosum_, Theob. This occurs throughout Equatorial Africa and is\r\n  known as the “jinja fly” in Uganda, the “fouron” in the French Congo,\r\n  the “kilteb” in the Sudan. It is a most vicious biter, and in some\r\n  parts occurs in “belts”; Dr. Christy found one such extending from\r\n  the shores of the Victoria Nyanza northwards along the right bank of\r\n  the Nile for twelve or fifteen miles or more, and perhaps three or\r\n  four miles wide. In this area the flies swarm in millions at certain\r\n  seasons, so much so that the natives have to leave their plantations.\r\n  The bite causes a weal, marked by a drop of blood.\r\n\r\n  _S. griseicollis_, Becker. The so-called “nimitti” occurs in Upper\r\n  Egypt and the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. It lives near the river and is\r\n  not found more than half a mile from it. Human beings are bitten on\r\n  the face and hands, animals in the region of the pudenda.\r\n\r\n  _S. latipes_, Meigen. This is a European species, also found in Natal.\r\n\r\n  _S. wellmanni_, Roubaud. The “ohomono” of Angola, where it bites\r\n  viciously and is dreaded by the naked porters.\r\n\r\n  _S. buissoni_, Roubaud. Occurs in abundance in the Marquesas Islands.\r\n  It has been _suggested_ that this species may help to propagate\r\n  leprosy.[394]\r\n\r\n[394] _Bull. du Mus. d’Hist. nat._, 1906, xii, p. 522.\r\n\r\n  A large number of these insects have been described by Lutz in\r\n  Brazil.[395]\r\n\r\n[395] _Mem. Inst. Oswaldo Cruz_, 1910, ii, fasc. 2, pp. 211–267.\r\n\r\n  A _Simulium_ sp. (?) is very harmful to poultry in Cape Colony.[396]\r\n\r\n[396] C. Fuller, “A New Poultry Pest,” 1899, Leaflet No. 1, Dept. Agric.\r\n\r\n  In America, _Simulidæ_ are most annoying. One, _S. meridionale_,\r\n  Riley, also known as the turkey gnat in the Mississippi Valley, has\r\n  been supposed to be the carrier of chicken cholera; anyhow, it has\r\n  caused the death of thousands of chickens and turkeys in Virginia\r\n  annually.[397]\r\n\r\n[397] _Insect Life_, 1888, i, p. 14.\r\n\r\n  In Mexico Townsend found a Simulium which was named _S.\r\n  occidentalis_, which caused great annoyance to man, many people being\r\n  so susceptible to them as to preserve through the gnat season a\r\n  chronic inflammation of the exposed parts of face and neck, resulting\r\n  from the repeated bites giving rise to sores.[398]\r\n\r\n[398] _Ibid._, 1893, v, p. 61.\r\n\r\n  Men and horses have been partially incapacitated by the bites of\r\n  sand-flies or Simulium in a Hampshire wood (Cantlie, _Brit. Med.\r\n  Journ._, April 28, 1900, v, No. 2,052, p. 1023).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 401.--Wing of Simulium.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 402.--Wing of Chironomus.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Chironomidæ* (Midges).\r\n\r\n  The _Chironomidæ_ or midges are not only frequently mistaken for\r\n  mosquitoes, but some are very annoying to man by biting him as\r\n  mosquitoes do. They are easily distinguished from true mosquitoes\r\n  (_Culicidæ_) by the following characters: (1) head small, often\r\n  retracted under the cowl-like thorax; (2) no scales to the wings\r\n  or body; and (3) the different arrangement of veins on the wings\r\n  (fig. 402).\r\n\r\n  Two genera are important as annoying man, namely, Culicoides,\r\n  Latreille, and Johannseniella, Williston. The larvæ of _Chironomidæ_\r\n  are either aquatic, both fresh water and marine, and help to\r\n  make the former foul,[399] according to Slater, or may, as in\r\n  _Ceratopogoninæ_, live beneath the bark of trees, etc. The pupæ\r\n  are very varied and also the life-histories of the different\r\n  genera.[400] The blood-sucking habit is confined to the sub-family\r\n  _Ceratopogoninæ_.\r\n\r\n[399] _Entomologist_, 1879, p. 89.\r\n\r\n[400] Theobald, “An Account of British Flies,” i, p. 172.\r\n\r\n\r\nSub-family. *Ceratopogoninæ.*\r\n\r\n  This sub-family of midges consists of very small species varying from\r\n  1 to 2 mm. in length; the wings have darkened areas, and the second\r\n  longitudinal vein is wanting, and the first and third veins are\r\n  stouter than the others and placed close to the anterior margin, the\r\n  fourth and fifth are forked; the antennæ in both male and female are\r\n  composed of fourteen segments, six or eight in the males bearing long\r\n  hairs.\r\n\r\n  The chief blood-sucking species belong to the genera Culicoides,\r\n  Latreille, and Johannseniella, Williston. The latter genus differs\r\n  from the former in the absence of an empodium or median appendage on\r\n  the last segment of the tarsi. The genus Ceratopogon, as restricted\r\n  by Kieffer, is not supposed to take vertebrate blood, but Austen has\r\n  recently noticed that the type specimen of _C. castaneus_, Walker,\r\n  and a new species described by him, apparently have their bodies\r\n  distended with blood. The wings in the _Ceratopogoninæ_ are carried\r\n  flat when at rest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 403.--A Ceratopogon, or midge. Greatly enlarged.]\r\n\r\n  In spite of their small size the females are the most bloodthirsty\r\n  and annoying of all insects. The Culicoides, which are often called\r\n  “sand-flies,” bite during the day and rarely at night. Usually they\r\n  are most troublesome between 3 and 6 p.m. They frequently attack in\r\n  swarms, especially in the open, and owing to their minute size can\r\n  get through fine mosquito netting. Some of them produce a distinct\r\n  “buzz” when on the wing. These insects are found in all parts of the\r\n  world. No species has been definitely connected with any disease, but\r\n  Culicoides has been suspected of carrying the germs of Delhi boil.\r\n  The larvæ of Culicoides are elongate in form and have smooth bodies\r\n  composed of thirteen segments including the head, which is horny;\r\n  there is no proleg on the first segment as seen in Chironomus, and on\r\n  the anal segment are retractile gills. They are very active and live\r\n  in the sap of various trees which saturates diseased bark.\r\n\r\n  The pupæ are smooth, but the abdominal segments bear a transverse\r\n  row of small spines. Austen describes a number of Culicoides and one\r\n  Johannseniella and three Ceratopogons from Africa,[401] and Lutz[402]\r\n  a number of this sub-family from Brazil, including a new genus,\r\n  Centrorhyncus. Another genus, Tersesthes, Townsend (Centrotypus,\r\n  Grassi; Mycterotypus, Noe), also occurs in Brazil.\r\n\r\n[401] _Bull. Ent. Res._, 1912, iii, pp. 99–108.\r\n\r\n[402] _Mem. Inst. Oswaldo Cruz_, 1913, v, fasc. 1, pp. 45–72, pls. 6–8;\r\nand 1914, vi, fasc. 2, pp. 81–99.\r\n\r\n  _Culicoides ornatus_, Taylor, is described from Townsville,\r\n  Australia, found in mangrove swamps. It is a very vicious biter and\r\n  causes considerable irritation, settling on hands and wrists (Taylor,\r\n  _Rep. Ent. Aust. Inst. Trop. Med._ (1912), 1913, p. 24).\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Psychodidæ* (Owl Midges).\r\n\r\n  This family of diptera is of considerable importance, not only on\r\n  account of the blood-sucking habits of some species, but especially\r\n  on account of one at least having been proved to be the carrying\r\n  agent of “papataci” fever, a three-day fever very prevalent in Malta\r\n  and several parts of Southern Europe in the autumn.\r\n\r\n  It is also possible that these small flies are connected with the\r\n  formation of “Delhi boil,” caused by a protozoan parasite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 404.--An owl midge, _Phlebotomus_ sp. Greatly\r\nenlarged. (From Giles’s “Gnats or Mosquitoes.”)]\r\n\r\n  _Psychodidæ_ are all very small flies, many of which have a moth-like\r\n  appearance, and owing to their fluffy nature are spoken of in\r\n  Britain as “owl flies,” sometimes also as “window flies.” Their\r\n  bodies and wings are covered with hairs, densely in some (sub-family\r\n  _Psychodinæ_), and in a few with patches of flat squamæ. In the\r\n  non-blood-sucking _Psychodinæ_ the wings are carried in a peculiar\r\n  manner downwards over the body, to a _slight extent_ resembling the\r\n  _Hepialidæ_, or swift moths. The wings may be ovoid or lanceolate,\r\n  and have a marked venation as seen in the figure. The proboscis\r\n  is short and non-suctorial in the majority of genera, but in the\r\n  sub-family _Phlebotominæ_ it is elongated and hard. The antennæ are\r\n  long and of sixteen segments, and bear whorls of fine hair.\r\n\r\n  There are two sub-families, _Psychodinæ_ and _Phlebotominæ_; in the\r\n  former the mouth is not suctorial; the female has a horny ovipositor\r\n  and the second longitudinal vein is branched at the root of the wing;\r\n  in the second sub-family the proboscis may be formed for sucking,\r\n  the female has no horny ovipositor, and the second long vein has its\r\n  first fork near the middle of the wing.\r\n\r\n  The sub-family _Phlebotominæ_ contains the genus Phlebotomus, which\r\n  occurs in South Europe, South Asia, Africa, North and South tropical\r\n  America. They are all small grey, brown, or dull yellow-coloured\r\n  flies, and carry their wings when at rest upwards like a butterfly.\r\n  The proboscis is moderately long and the legs long and thin.\r\n\r\n  The females are most vicious blood-suckers, but in some species\r\n  anyhow the males also bite (_P. duboscii_). They are mainly\r\n  nocturnal feeders and hide away during the day in any dark corners or\r\n  crevices.\r\n\r\n  The life-cycle has been worked out by Newstead[403] and Grassi[404]\r\n  in Europe, and by Howlett[405] in India.\r\n\r\n[403] _Bull. Ent. Res._, 1911, ii, pt. 2, pp. 47–78.\r\n\r\n[404] “Ricerche sui Flebotomi,” _Mem. della Soc. ital. della Scienze_,\r\n1907, ser. 3, xiv, pp. 353–394.\r\n\r\n[405] “Indian Sand-flies,” _Ind. Med. Cong._, 1909, sec. III,\r\npp. 239–242.\r\n\r\n  The larvæ have been found in crevices in rocks and caves, in dirty\r\n  cellars, and dark damp places containing rubbish, and are also said\r\n  to live in crevices in the walls of privies and cesspits.\r\n\r\n  The minute larva is very marked; as figured by Newstead it has two\r\n  long chætæ projecting upwards, in some stages branched, in others\r\n  simple, and on the segments a few blunt spine-like processes. The\r\n  pupæ are found in similar situations. The ova are very minute,\r\n  elongate, translucent white, and covered with a thin coating of\r\n  viscous matter when first laid; soon after they become dark brown,\r\n  shiny, with long black wavy lines. Newstead found the incubation\r\n  period in Malta to last for about nine days in _P. papatacii_. Five\r\n  species are known in Europe, five in Africa,[406] two in North\r\n  America, and eight are described by Annandale[407] in the Oriental\r\n  region. Lutz and Neiva have described three species from Brazil[408]\r\n  (_P. longipalpis_, _intermedius_ and _squamiventris_).\r\n\r\n[406] Newstead: _Bull. Ent. Res._, 1912, iii, pp. 361–367.\r\n\r\n[407] _Rec. Ind. Mus._, v, pt. 3, Nos. 13 and 14.\r\n\r\n[408] _Mem. Inst. Oswaldo Cruz_, 1912, iv, fasc. I, pp. 84–95.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Brachycera* (Flies).\r\n\r\n  The antennæ as a rule have three segments, and are usually shorter\r\n  than the head. The first segment of the antennæ is frequently very\r\n  small, and the third one is generally the largest, and sometimes\r\n  possesses a terminal annulated bristle. The palpi have from one to\r\n  three segments; the mandibles are covered by the labium. The three\r\n  thoracic rings are coalesced; wings are almost always present, the\r\n  posterior ones being rudimentary and covered with a little scale.\r\n  From the ova legless maggots are hatched, which as a rule have not a\r\n  distinct head, but occasionally possess two claw-like hooklets. These\r\n  maggots live in decomposing organic matter; they rarely live in water\r\n  and some of them are parasitic. They either become barrel-shaped\r\n  pupæ within the last larval integument or, after casting it, are\r\n  transformed into naked pupæ. The larvæ of numerous _Brachycera_\r\n  have been observed in man, some in ulcers or on mucous membranes,\r\n  others in the skin or in the intestine, etc. In many cases the report\r\n  only mentions the presence of the larvæ of flies; in other cases\r\n  the species has been determined; whilst in still other cases the\r\n  corresponding adult creature is unknown. We must therefore confine\r\n  ourselves to describing the most common varieties.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Phoridæ.*\r\n\r\n  These flies belong to the same division of _Diptera_, the Aschiza, as\r\n  the family _Syrphidæ_ or “hover flies.” They are all small insects\r\n  with marked antennæ and wings; the former have the third segment\r\n  globular and enlarged, and thus hiding the first two; the wings are\r\n  short and broad, the venation shows two short, thick, long veins with\r\n  four thin ones running out from them. The larvæ normally live in\r\n  decaying animal and vegetable matter, but one species, _Aphiochæta\r\n  ferruginea_, Brun., has been found as an intestinal parasite of man.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Aphiochæta ferruginea*, Brun.\r\n\r\n  This small fly belonging to this family is of an orange-ochreous\r\n  colour, the upper part of the thorax tawny, and with dark bands on\r\n  the abdomen, legs pale yellow, the hind femora tipped with dark\r\n  brown. It measures only 2 to 3 mm. in length. This insect is shown by\r\n  Austen to be widely distributed in the tropics, being found in India,\r\n  Burma, West Africa, and Central America. The larvæ breed in decaying\r\n  animal matter, such as putrid meat, decomposing shell-fish, etc.\r\n\r\n  Heusner bred out sixty-three flies from larvæ taken from an Indian’s\r\n  foot.\r\n\r\n  Baker (_Proc. Burma Branch Brit. Med. Assoc._, 1891, p. 11–16) found\r\n  that the maggots of this fly were passed _per anum_ by a European at\r\n  intervals during a period of ten months. Baker found that the larvæ\r\n  fed on human fæces; from the egg stage to the deposition of eggs from\r\n  the resultant brood of flies occupied twenty-two days. He concludes\r\n  that they are capable of propagating, and do so while living within\r\n  the human intestines. He also records the larvæ in two girls.\r\n\r\n  The larva does not seem to have been described, but Austen describes\r\n  the pupa (_Trans. Soc. Trop. Med. and Hyg._, iii, No. 5, p. 229).\r\n\r\n\r\n*Phora rufipes*, Meig.\r\n\r\n  The larvæ of the “hump-backed fly” live in rotting potatoes,\r\n  mushrooms, radishes, etc., and when accidentally introduced into the\r\n  intestine of man can, like other larvæ, live there twenty-four hours\r\n  and even more, and may set up serious gastric disturbances.\r\n\r\n  _P. rufipes_ is the same as _P. pallipes_, Latr.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Sepsidæ.*\r\n\r\n  Small blackish flies, elongate, with abdomen narrowed at the base,\r\n  thickened and curved downwards towards the extremity. Larvæ often\r\n  found in decaying vegetables, ham, cheese, etc. The larvae have the\r\n  power of skipping; conical in form, pointed in front, truncated\r\n  behind, about 5 mm. long, shiny and smooth, the anal segment with\r\n  fleshy protuberances. The genus Piophila has a short proboscis and\r\n  the cross-veins of the wings approximate.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Piophila casei*, L.\r\n\r\n  Cheese flies. The larvæ live in ripe cheese, with which they are\r\n  sometimes introduced into human beings (Meschede).\r\n\r\n  The larvæ of the cheese flies (_Piophila casei_) may pass through the\r\n  alimentary canal of human beings alive, and have been occasionally\r\n  referred to in cases of internal myiasis. It also breeds in dead\r\n  bodies in adipose tissue. Howard records it on human excrement. It\r\n  is thus possible that some of the recorded cases of this pest being\r\n  passed alive may be due to eggs deposited on human fæces.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Syrphidæ* (Hover and Drone Flies).\r\n\r\n  Amongst the large family of _Syrphidæ_ is found a section known as\r\n  the _Eristalinæ_ or drone flies, whose curious long-tailed larvæ\r\n  are popularly called “rat-tail larvæ,” on account of the end of the\r\n  body being drawn out into a long telescopic tail of two segments,\r\n  at the end of which are placed the breathing pores. These larvæ\r\n  live in water, no matter how foul, and in liquid manure. They have\r\n  occasionally been obtained in foul drinking water by human beings\r\n  and from eating watercress improperly washed or from badly kept\r\n  beds. Austen (_Trans. Soc. Trop. Med. and Hyg._, iii, No. 6, p. 221)\r\n  records that in the autumn of 1907 a number of the larvæ of the\r\n  common drone fly (_Eristalis tenax_) were passed _per rectum_ by a\r\n  woman in Hampshire who had recently arrived from France. The patient\r\n  had eaten a considerable quantity of watercress before leaving\r\n  France. I have twice found small Eristalis larvæ clinging by their\r\n  long tails on watercress served at table.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Drosophilidæ.*\r\n\r\n  Small, rather plump flies, with short, broad abdomen, with bristles\r\n  on the head and legs. Often abundant in decomposing fruit, and may\r\n  occur in dense masses.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Drosophila melanogaster*, Br.\r\n\r\n  The larvæ of this fly occur in over-ripe fruit and in fungi, often\r\n  also in human habitations, and live in substances undergoing acid\r\n  fermentation (vinegar, decaying fungi, rotting fruit, in damaged\r\n  spots in diseased trees), much more rarely in animal substances, and\r\n  they occasionally gain access to the human intestine (for example, by\r\n  the medium of sour milk). When introduced in any quantity, they cause\r\n  vomiting or attacks resembling colic; when taken in the pupal stage\r\n  no unpleasant results are produced.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Muscidæ.*\r\n\r\n*Teichomyza fusca*, Macq.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Scatella urinaria_, Rob. Desv.; _Ephydra longipennis_, Meigen.\r\n\r\n  The larvæ live in the urine in privies. Several authors state they\r\n  have found them in fresh fæces or in vomited matter. Pruvot states\r\n  that they continue for three days in the stomach of rats into which\r\n  they have been intentionally introduced. (Pruvot, G., “Contrib. à\r\n  l’étude des larves de dipt, trouv. dans le corps humain,” _Thèse de\r\n  Par._, 1882; Chatin, J., in _Comp. rend. Soc. de Biol._, Paris, 1888\r\n  (8), v, p. 396; Roger, H., _ibid._, 1851 (1), iii, pp. 88, etc.)\r\n\r\n\r\n*Homalomyia canicularis*, L., etc.\r\n\r\n  _Homalomyia manicata_, Meig., live as larvæ in decomposing vegetable\r\n  matter or in cultivated vegetables (cabbage); they are easily\r\n  recognizable by their plumed bristles, which are situated laterally\r\n  on the body segments. They obtain access fairly often to the human\r\n  intestine and give rise to very uncomfortable symptoms. Cases have\r\n  been recorded from Germany, Austria, France, England, North America\r\n  (Wacker, in _Artzl. Intelligenzbl._, 1883, xxx, p. 109; Florentin,\r\n  in _Compt. rend. Soc. de Biol._, Paris, 1904, lvi, p. 525; and other\r\n  authors).\r\n\r\n  The larvæ of an allied genus (Anthomyia), which, however, does not\r\n  possess plumed bristles, has been found in the external auditory\r\n  meatus of a man (_A. pluvialis_, according to Danthon).\r\n\r\n  [_H. canicularis_ is common to Europe and North America, and is\r\n  an abundant house-fly. It is the small house-fly so often seen\r\n  on windows. Besides living on vegetable matter, they have also\r\n  been found in the nests of the humble bee. Larvæ of this species\r\n  (fig. 405) were sent to the British Museum, taken from the fæces of\r\n  a woman suffering from cancer.[409] They were found at Shrewsbury.\r\n  Hagen[410] reports the larvæ of this fly as occurring alive in the\r\n  urethra of a patient.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n[409] Theobald, “First Report Economic Zoology,” _Brit.

(Common House-fly).\r\n\r\n  It is not only on account of a few larvæ of the common house-fly\r\n  (_Musca domestica_) being found in the intestines of man that it is\r\n  of importance medically. It is far more important on account of the\r\n  part it plays in the spread of diseases of the intestines, such as\r\n  typhoid fever and cholera, infantile diarrhœa and dysentery.\r\n\r\n  Howard and Clark (_Journ. Exp. Med._, 1912, xvi, No. 6, pp. 850–859)\r\n  have shown that the house-fly is capable of carrying the virus of\r\n  poliomyelitis for several days on the surface of the body and for\r\n  several hours in the gastro-intestinal tract. The house-fly may also\r\n  distribute the ova of _Tænia solium_ and the white worms (Oxyuris and\r\n  Ascaris). It has also been proved that they may carry the germs of\r\n  tuberculosis, and it is said that they play an important part in the\r\n  spread of infectious ophthalmia in Egypt.\r\n\r\n  This insect is found in all parts of the world. In warm countries\r\n  it breeds all the year round, and it may do so even in temperate\r\n  climates in warm places, such as stove houses. Most, however, die\r\n  off in the autumn; but some survive the winter as adults, in such\r\n  places as kitchens, restaurants, and warm houses. I have never failed\r\n  to find a few _Musca domestica_ in houses during the winter. The\r\n  majority, however, hibernate as puparia.\r\n\r\n  The females deposit from 120 to 150 eggs in a batch in stable\r\n  manure, rotting vegetation, house refuse, spent hops, old soiled\r\n  bedding, etc. A single female may lay as many as six batches of ova\r\n  during her life. The eggs are shiny white, and hatch in from eight\r\n  to twenty-four hours in warm weather to three or four days in cool\r\n  weather. The white footless maggots are cylindrical, tapering to a\r\n  point at the head end, truncated posteriorly. The head consists of\r\n  two dark mandibular hooks and two short antennæ. On the tail end are\r\n  two plates, the stigmata, in which the main tracheal trunks open;\r\n  in the second segment are a small pair of projecting stigmata. The\r\n  larval stage lasts from seven to five days in hot weather; but in\r\n  cold weather in temperate climes it may last six or eight weeks.\r\n\r\n  The larva on reaching maturity becomes a barrel-shaped puparium of\r\n  a dark brown to black colour, and in this case changes to the pupa.\r\n  This stage lasts from three days in the tropics to four or five weeks\r\n  in cold weather, the life cycle thus varying from ten days in the\r\n  tropics to fourteen in warm weather in Europe up to three or four\r\n  months under unfavourable conditions.\r\n\r\n  All breeding grounds should be burnt or otherwise done away with,\r\n  such as stable manure, house and kitchen refuse, human excrement and\r\n  soiled substances, also decaying vegetation as soon as possible,\r\n  certainly by every sixth day. Stable manure should be kept in closed\r\n  receptacles and should be removed by every sixth day to at least\r\n  one mile from habitations and sprinkled with chloride of lime. All\r\n  kitchen and household refuse should be burnt at once or buried in\r\n  pits and covered with soil. Latrines should be as far as possible\r\n  from hospitals, mess rooms and tents. Food--especially milk, sugar\r\n  and fruit--should be kept screened with muslin when house-flies\r\n  are about. Mess rooms and tents and hospitals should have doors\r\n  and windows screened with fine wire gauze during the fly season.\r\n  All possible steps should be taken to prevent them contaminating\r\n  man’s food and from breeding in human excrement and from entering\r\n  hospitals. When present in dwelling-houses in numbers they may be\r\n  killed by fumigation with pyrethrum or sulphur.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Chrysomyia*, Rob.

The larvæ\r\n  are yellowish white, 16 mm. long, are armed with two strong mouth\r\n  hooks, and provided with spinous rings (screw-worm); they lie hid in\r\n  the nasal and frontal sinuses, in the pharynx, larynx, etc.; they\r\n  perforate the mucous membranes, even cartilage, migrate into the\r\n  eyes, the cranial cavity, middle ear, and cause severe disturbances;\r\n  after the mature stage, in which the larvæ leave the host to enter\r\n  the pupal state, these symptoms often spontaneously abate after a\r\n  lapse of eight days, leaving behind greater or less cicatrices, and\r\n  consequently also defects in function of the organs attacked.

During the next days\r\n  severe pains set in, and there was a discharge of blood and pus from\r\n  both ears, as well as from the nose. On washing out the meatus the\r\n  maggots made their appearance.\r\n\r\n  _Lucilia cæsar_ and _L. sericata_ have also been observed in the\r\n  larval state in man (Thompson, Hope, Henneberg and Calendoli, Napoli,\r\n  1907).\r\n\r\n  [This golden-green fly usually lays its eggs on decomposing organic\r\n  matter; now and again it lays its eggs in wounds on man.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Pycnosoma*, Brauer and v. Bergenstamm.\r\n\r\n  The species of this genus have a general resemblance to the Lucilias\r\n  and Chrysomyias, but the body is stouter and the abdomen banded.\r\n  The genus can be distinguished from Chrysomyia by the absence of\r\n  the three thoracic stripes and by the eyes of the male, in which\r\n  the facets forming the upper portion are much enlarged, whereas\r\n  in Chrysomyia they are not noticeably larger. Austen also points\r\n  out that the sterno-pleural bristles in Pycnosoma are 1 : 1, in\r\n  Chrysomyia 2 : 1. The genus is found in tropical Asia and Africa\r\n  only. All records of Chrysomyia (Compsomyia) in India must be\r\n  referred to this genus. Bezzi and Stein (“Katalog der Palăarktischen\r\n  Dipteren,” 1907, iii, p. 543), however, regard the two as synonymous.\r\n\r\n  The larvæ are frequently found in the nostrils of man and burrow into\r\n  the sinus, but normally they live on decaying animal matter.\r\n\r\n  Pycnosoma forms the so-called Indian screw-worm. Patterson (_Ind.\r\n  Med. Gaz._, October, 1909, xliv, No. 10) records the case of a woman\r\n  at Tezpin, Assam, from whom as many as 100 larvæ were removed at\r\n  one time, and later the left orbital cavity was found packed with\r\n  hundreds of maggots; eventually the patient died. It is possible that\r\n  this, however, was due to a species of Sarcophaga. Austen undoubtedly\r\n  records this genus causing nasal myiasis in India (_Trans. Soc. Trop.\r\n  Med. and Hyg._, iii, p. 235). At Dehra Doon, U.P., a woman discharged\r\n  100 larvæ from her nose, with great pain in the nasal region and\r\n  frontal sinuses.\r\n\r\n  The so-called “peenash,” a common malady in Rajputana, is a true\r\n  nasal myiasis.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Sarcophaga*, Mg.\r\n\r\n*Sarcophaga carnosa*, L., 1758.\r\n\r\n  Larvæ of flesh-flies provided with two claws at the anterior end,\r\n  which settle on raw or cooked meat, and in the open on carcases\r\n  of animals; they are often observed in man, both in the intestine\r\n  (introduced with food) and in the nasal cavities, frontal sinus,\r\n  conjunctiva, aural meatus, anus, vulva, vagina, prepuce, and open\r\n  ulcers, often migrating further from the regions first attacked.\r\n  (Gayot in _Compt. rend.

(After Blanchard.)]\r\n\r\n  Indigenous to the Senegal and neighbouring districts; in the district\r\n  of Cayor (between the mouth of the Senegal and Cape Verde) the larva\r\n  is known as the “ver de Cayor.” It lives under the skin, especially\r\n  at the lower extremities and the lower region of the trunk, producing\r\n  small boils, which cause pain, but after about eight days, when\r\n  the larva leaves the body to enter the pupal stage, the pain\r\n  discontinues. Besides man the larva occurs in dogs, goats, cats, and\r\n  in the jackal. It is still questionable whether the fly deposits its\r\n  eggs direct or on the ground, from whence the larvæ as they emerge\r\n  gain access to animals and man. Larvæ yellowish-white, 14 mm. long,\r\n  4 mm. wide, eleven segments[414]; head with two globular antennæ-like\r\n  appendages, two black curved mouth hooks, and two wart-shaped, finely\r\n  spinous structures at their base. Body evenly covered to the seventh\r\n  segment with small black prickles, which are stronger at the sides\r\n  and the anterior borders of the segments; from the seventh they\r\n  increase in size, on the two hindermost they are wanting; on the last\r\n  segment two deep yellow spiracles, each with three markedly curved\r\n  fissures; in addition two stigmata on the posterior border of the\r\n  first segment. Duration of the larval stage about eight days. Upon\r\n  the construction of roads in Guinea the larva is spread by dogs far\r\n  into the interior.\r\n\r\n[414] [Austen gives the length as 12 to 12·5 mm. and the breadth as\r\n5 mm.; he describes the larva as follows: Bluntly pointed at the\r\nanterior extremity, and truncate behind; from third to eleventh\r\nsegments thickly covered with minute recurved spines of brownish\r\nchitin, usually arranged in transverse series of groups of two or\r\nmore, which can be seen to form more or less distinct undulating\r\nand irregular transverse rows. In each of the two posterior\r\nstigmatic plates, the respiratory slit on either side of the median\r\none is characteristically curved, resembling an inverted note of\r\ninterrogation.

The “larva of Natal,” as one may still term the species\r\n  provisionally, as its identity is not certain, possesses on its head\r\n  (besides the mouth hooks) lateral protuberances beset with a row of\r\n  chitinous spines. The cuticle of the body is spinose. The spines are\r\n  difficult to recognize on account of their transparency and want of\r\n  colour; they are longest over the anterior segments, from the fifth\r\n  they become smaller, and over the hindermost they are very small.\r\n  Apart from the foremost segment, the position they take is that of\r\n  rows running transversely or obliquely, two to four generally in\r\n  juxtaposition; the number of spines in the groups gradually increases\r\n  posteriorly, attaining the number of eight to twelve on the sixth\r\n  segment, and this number is maintained to the end of the body.\r\n  Isolated spines are found over the head; over the second, third and\r\n  fourth segments single ones are still found adjoining the groups\r\n  of spines, from the fifth onward they are wanting. From here the\r\n  spines cover the whole free surface of the segments; over the fourth\r\n  the anterior three-quarters, over the third two-thirds and over the\r\n  first and second only the anterior half. The stigmata found at the\r\n  anterior end also serve as distinguishing characters. The parasitic\r\n  stage appears to last about fourteen days. [Fuller (_Agric. Journ._,\r\n  Dept. Agric. and Mines, Natal, 1901, iv, p. 606) refers to this as\r\n  _Bengalia depressa_ also.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Cordylobia*, Grünberg, 1903.\r\n\r\n*Cordylobia grünbergi*, Dönitz.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Ochromyia anthropophaga_, Grünberg, _nec_ Blanch.; _Cordylobia\r\n  anthropophaga_, Grünberg.\r\n\r\n  Endemic in German East Africa and neighbouring regions. Larva up\r\n  to 14 mm. long, 4 to 5·5 mm. wide, of cylindrical shape, slightly\r\n  narrowed behind, truncated, gradually tapering in front; antennæ-like\r\n  processes, cone-shaped, blunt. Smaller cylindrical formations at the\r\n  base of the mouth hooks surrounded by a circle of chitinous hooks.\r\n  Body from the first segment covered with small brown squamous spines\r\n  which are disposed in numerous irregular transverse rows. The spines\r\n  are small over the two first segments, the two posterior thirds of\r\n  all the segments, as well as from the eighth; over the third to the\r\n  seventh they are larger, but between these there are very small\r\n  spines. The breathing pores of the stigmata at the anterior end are\r\n  kidney-shaped; the orifices are elongated and very tortuous, each\r\n  divided into three. The larval period appears to last several weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Cordylobia anthropophaga*, Grünberg.\r\n\r\n  This well-known cutaneous African parasite seems to have been the\r\n  cause of much confusion in regard to names. It belongs to the genus\r\n  Cordylobia of Grünberg, and is one of the family _Muscidæ_, and\r\n  differs from Auchmeromyia in that the second abdominal segment of\r\n  the female is of normal size, whilst in Auchmeromyia it is more than\r\n  half the length of the whole abdomen, and in the male the eyes are\r\n  holoptic or close together, whilst in Auchmeromyia they are wide\r\n  apart. The flies of this genus (three so far described) attack man in\r\n  their larval stage (anyway two of the three), and also dogs and other\r\n  animals, by burrowing into the skin and producing painful boils.\r\n\r\n  [_C. anthropophaga_, Grünberg, is widely distributed in Africa,\r\n  extending from Senegal, where its maggot is known as the “ver de\r\n  Cayor,” and is referred to on p. 590 as _Ochromyia anthropophaga_,\r\n  E. Blanchard, to Natal, where it is known as the “Natal worm,” and\r\n  referred to erroneously on p. 591 as _Bengalia depressa_, Walker.\r\n\r\n  [It is a thick-set Muscid of a general straw-yellow colour, with\r\n  blackish markings on the dorsum of both thorax and abdomen, about\r\n  9·5 mm. long. The larva is fat and when mature about 12 mm. long,\r\n  bluntly pointed in front, truncate behind; from the third to eleventh\r\n  segments it is thickly covered with minute recurved spines of a\r\n  brownish colour, arranged in transverse series of groups of two or\r\n  more, which form more or less distinct irregular transverse rows.\r\n  On each of the two posterior stigmatic plates, the respiratory slit\r\n  on either side of the median one is characteristically curved,\r\n  resembling an inverted note of interrogation. The puparium is brown\r\n  to ferruginous or black and about 10 mm. long. The maggots are\r\n  found in both natives and white men, and occur as a severe pest in\r\n  dogs, also in monkeys, rats, and other mammals. In Sierra Leone it\r\n  is called the “tumba fly.” The larvæ have been frequently found as\r\n  true subcutaneous parasites, each larva living singly and forming a\r\n  boil or warble in the skin, with an opening just as in an ox-warble,\r\n  through which the maggot breathes and eventually escapes. Although\r\n  they more usually occur as isolated specimens, Marshall found in\r\n  Salisbury, South Rhodesia, that sixty were extracted from one lady,\r\n  and Bérenger-Féraud, in Senegal, that more than 300 occurred in a\r\n  single spaniel puppy.\r\n\r\n  [Neave (_Bull. Ent. Res._, 1912, iii, p. 217) records it from ulcers\r\n  in a native at Lourenço Marques in 1908, and at the same time from\r\n  ulcers in a dog, and that it is a severe pest to man in Mozambique\r\n  and parts of the Transvaal. It seems to be more abundant in North\r\n  Rhodesia and Nyasaland than to the north (Neave, _Bull. Ent. Res._,\r\n  1912, iii, p. 310). It is also recorded in Zanzibar, German East\r\n  Africa, Uganda, East Tropical Africa (Neave).\r\n\r\n  [Simpson (_Bull. Ent.

The posterior stigmata are\r\n  bean-shaped, each with three markedly tortuous openings. Duration of\r\n  the larval stage unknown; the same applies to the pupal and imago\r\n  stages.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Auchmeromyia luteola*, Fabricius.\r\n\r\n  [This fly, the parent of the so-called Congo floor maggot,[416]\r\n  belongs to a nearly allied Muscid genus to Cordylobia, but which\r\n  can at once be told by the great length of the second abdominal\r\n  segment. The maggot occurs in numbers in the native huts in the\r\n  Congo region and is fairly common in central and northern parts\r\n  of Mozambique; it is also recorded from the Zambesi River and the\r\n  vicinity of Barberton in the Eastern Transvaal (_Bull. Ent. Res._,\r\n  1912, iii, p. 216), in German East Africa, in Nyasaland, and British\r\n  East Africa. It is also recorded from Bara, Kordofan,[417] where they\r\n  occurred on the floor of the men’s prison and bit the prisoners.\r\n  They were destroyed by sprinkling Jeyes’ fluid on the floor. Neave\r\n  states (_ibid._, p. 310) that it occurs in the more neglected huts\r\n  in native villages throughout tropical Africa, and frequently enters\r\n  a tent when pitched near a village. It is also found in West Africa.\r\n  The fly is thick-set and about the size and build of a bluebottle\r\n  fly; length 10 to 12 mm.; tawny in colour to dirty yellowish-brown,\r\n  with dusky hairs, giving it a smoky appearance; the flattened thorax\r\n  has long dark stripes and the abdomen a dusky line in the centre of\r\n  the second segment, which meets a dark line on its posterior border;\r\n  the dusky third segment has a narrow yellowish anterior line; the\r\n  fourth segment is also dusky; legs buff with black hairs; the fifth\r\n  tarsal segment black. The larvæ are whitish, becoming reddish after\r\n  a feast of blood, with much wrinkled skin and rather flat and broad.\r\n  They live in crevices of the mud floor, under sleeping mats during\r\n  the daytime, and come out at night and suck the blood of sleepers\r\n  and then retire to shelter again. Dutton, Todd, and Christy noticed\r\n  that where people slept on beds or platforms raised above the floor\r\n  the maggots were not so numerous as under the sleeping mats laid on\r\n  the ground. They turned up many of the maggots from a depth of three\r\n  inches or more.[418]--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n[416] Dutton, Todd and Christy, “The Congo Floor Maggot,” _Mem. xiii\r\nLiv. Sch. Trop.

They are found as\r\n  parasites in warm-blooded animals, and man is frequently attacked\r\n  by them. The members of this family have the mouth rudimentary,\r\n  many of them are hairy and bee-like, with large eyes and the head\r\n  large, the lower part more or less swollen. The thorax is large with\r\n  a distinct transverse suture, and the abdomen short and stumpy or\r\n  very slightly elongated. The male genitalia are hidden, whilst the\r\n  female ovipositor is often elongated. The wings may be transparent\r\n  (Hypoderma) or mottled (Gastrophilus), and have muscid-like venation;\r\n  the tegulæ usually large, the legs moderately long.\r\n\r\n  [As a rule each species is confined to a particular host, but as we\r\n  see recorded here those that attack animals may also attack man.\r\n  The flies occur in warm weather and usually during the warmest\r\n  part of the day, and have a strong dislike to shade and water. The\r\n  genus Hypoderma attack oxen, sheep, goats, antelope and musk deer;\r\n  Oestrus, sheep, antelope and horses; Gastrophilus, the horse and\r\n  ass; Cephenomyia, the deer; Cepholomyia, the camel and buffalo;\r\n  Dermatobia, dogs, cats, oxen, deer, apes and man; Cuterebra and\r\n  Rogenhofera, rodents and opossums.\r\n\r\n  [Some live as parasites in the stomach and intestines (Gastrophilus);\r\n  others infest the skin (Hypoderma, Dermatobia and Oestromyia, the\r\n  latter on _Lagomys_ and _Hypodæus_); _Œdemagena tarandi_ also infests\r\n  the skin of the reindeer in Siberia and boreal America. Oestrus lives\r\n  in the nasal sinus, and Cephalomyia in the throat as well, Cuterebra\r\n  and Rogenhofera, the skin or scrotum, so that we have really three\r\n  groups of parasitic oestride larvæ: (i) cutaneous, (ii) intestinal,\r\n  and (iii) facial.\r\n\r\n  [No species seems confined to man, but the so-called “creeping\r\n  disease,” caused by Hypodermæ, and the attack of sheep nasal fly are\r\n  comparatively common, as also is the Dermatobia attack.--F. V. T.].\r\n\r\n\r\nCUTANEOUS OESTRIDÆ.\r\n\r\n  The eggs are deposited on the surface of the body; the larvæ burrow\r\n  in the skin, which they reach after somewhat long peregrination.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Hypoderma*, Latreille.\r\n\r\n*Hypoderma bovis*, de Geer.\r\n\r\n  The cattle fly or warble fly, which swarms during the hot season,\r\n  settles on the head or on the hair of grazing cattle: through\r\n  the young being licked off they gain access to the mouth and are\r\n  swallowed.[419] The larvæ appear first in the commencing portion of\r\n  the stomach, to escape, as some state, into the preceding sections of\r\n  the alimentary canal; at any rate, they are found from July onward\r\n  regularly in the submucous tissue of the pharynx, in which they\r\n  travel about for several months (up to November, and in isolated\r\n  cases up to February); they then penetrate the muscularis and migrate\r\n  by way of the subserosa along the mediastinum, the crura of the\r\n  diaphragm, the renal capsules, and the intermuscular connective\r\n  tissue of the psoas muscle in the direction of the spinal canal,\r\n  into which they penetrate by way of the muscles and nerves, through\r\n  the intervertebral foramina. Here they stay for about two to three\r\n  months, then they leave the spinal canal again through the vertebral\r\n  foramina and make their way (from January to March) through the\r\n  intermuscular connective tissue of the muscles of the back to the\r\n  skin of the back, where sooner or later (from January to June) they\r\n  arrive and enter a resting stage, which commences with penetration of\r\n  the skin and terminates with outward migration from the boils due to\r\n  the wound set up by the maggot. At the commencement of this period\r\n  the larvæ cast their skin, and their form, hitherto cylindrical,\r\n  becomes oval. After about a month, a second moulting of the skin\r\n  takes place--the third larval stage, which lasts about two and a half\r\n  months (up to June). The approaching end of the same is indicated\r\n  by a change of colour on the part of the larva from the hitherto\r\n  yellowish-white to brown and finally to blackish-brown. When they\r\n  have become mature the larvæ leave the warbles, drop on to the ground\r\n  and pass into the pupal stage in the superficial layers of the soil\r\n  within twelve to thirty-six hours. After about a month the flies\r\n  emerge. Irregularities with regard to the time and direction of the\r\n  migrations of the larvæ take place (Jost, H., in _Zeitschr. f. wiss.\r\n  Zool._, 1907, xxxvi, p. 644).\r\n\r\n[419] [This is not the case, for Carpenter has shown that muzzled\r\ncalves become infected (“Mém. First Int. Cong. Ent.,” pp. 289–293).\r\nJost (_Zeitschr. f. wiss. Zool._, 1907, xxxvi, pp. 644–715)\r\nthinks that the ova, not young larvæ, are ingested (vide note in\r\nSupplement).--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\nIn a number of cases the larva of the cattle fly has been observed in\r\nthe human integument, usually in the winter months, that is, during the\r\nmigration period; consequently, it is not surprising that the larvæ\r\nbefore they enter on the resting stage and produce a warble undergo\r\nmigrations. But that this takes place subcutaneously--which does not\r\nappear to be so in the case of cattle--is perhaps explained by the fact\r\nthat in man, on account of the short space that has to be traversed,\r\nthe larvæ are not sufficiently developed to enter on the resting stage\r\nsimultaneously upon having obtained access to the integument. Whether\r\nthe Oestrid larvæ in Bulgaria that similarly migrate beneath the skin\r\nin man belong to the cattle fly or to another species, or even another\r\ngenus, has not yet been ascertained. (Doctorow, in _Arch. de Par._,\r\n1906, x, p. 309; Spring, A., in _Bull. Acad. sci. Belg._, 1861 (2), iv,\r\np. 172; Walker, R., in _Brit. Med. Journ._, 1870, i, p. 151; Kjelgaard,\r\nin _Ugeskr. f. Laeger_, 1904, p. 535; Condorelli, M., in _Bull. Soc.\r\nZool. Ital._, 1904, xiii, p. 171.)\r\n\r\n\r\n*Hypoderma lineata*, de Villers.\r\n\r\n  The larvæ of this species, that occurs not only in Europe but in\r\n  North America, live under similar conditions in the skin, very rarely\r\n  in man; also migrating subcutaneously (Topsent in _Arch. de Par._,\r\n  1901, iv, p. 609).\r\n\r\n  [In Sweden, the ox warble fly (_H. bovis_) is well known to attack\r\n  man. Schoyen states “that over 100 years ago up to the present time\r\n  cases of travelling grubs under the human skin in some districts of\r\n  Sweden were well known.” The species appeared to be _H. bovis_, many\r\n  of which he had examined. They accomplished long ramblings under the\r\n  skin, always in an upward direction, previous to their appearance\r\n  through an opening in a tumour on the upper part of the body, on the\r\n  head, neck, or shoulders. An interesting case is recorded in _Insect\r\n  Life_, ii, pp. 238–239. A bot similar to _H. diana_ was taken from\r\n  the eye and cheek of a child at Kane, McKean County, Pa., U.S.A. It\r\n  was said to have travelled in five months from the elbow to the eye.\r\n  Riley later (_Insect Life_, iv, p. 310) was inclined to think the\r\n  maggot was that of _H. lineata_, the common American ox warble, which\r\n  is also found in Europe in great numbers. I have recorded another\r\n  case in England (_Rept. Econ. Zool._ for year ending September 30,\r\n  1910, p. 128), where Dr. Menzies removed the larva of _H. bovis_\r\n  from the upper eyelid of a patient. It caused considerable swelling\r\n  of the face, much pain and distress; but the case did well, and the\r\n  wound healed at once. The larva was nearly mature. Numerous other\r\n  references to this so-called creeping disease will be found in the\r\n  Supplement.\r\n\r\n  [It is quite probable that _bovis_ and _lineata_ are confused in the\r\n  latter accounts. The larvæ are, however, easily distinguished if\r\n  carefully examined.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n\r\n*Hypoderma diana*, Brauer.\r\n\r\n  In its larval stage it lives like other species of Hypoderma,\r\n  attacking the red deer (_Cervas elaphas_) and roe deer (_Cervas\r\n  capreolus_); it is occasionally also found in man (Joseph, in\r\n  “Myiasis externa dermatosa,” Hamburg, 1800; Völkel, in _Berl. klin.\r\n  Wochenschr._, 1883, xx, p. 209).\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Dermatobia*, Brauer.\r\n\r\n*Dermatobia cyaniventris*, Macq.\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Dermatobia noxialis_, J. Goudot.\r\n\r\n  The genus Dermatobia represents the subcutaneous _Oestridæ_ of Europe\r\n  in warmer parts of America. Both domesticated and wild mammals are\r\n  attacked, according to one statement birds also (_Ramphastus_), and\r\n  man with fair frequency.[420] It is assumed that in all cases one and\r\n  the same species is concerned, for which recently a name originating\r\n  from C. Linné, jun. (_Oestrus hominis_), has been employed. Three\r\n  larval stages are recognized in the skin; the two first appear to\r\n  resemble one another in the club-shaped or tadpole-like appearance\r\n  (called macaque in Cayenne, mayacuil [mayoquil] in Mexico), the third\r\n  is swollen spindle-shaped (Berne, called torcel). Segments 2 to 4\r\n  in the club-shaped larvæ are closely beset with small black spines,\r\n  segments 5 to 7 bear at the anterior border a complete ring of strong\r\n  black hooks, segments 4 to 6 a similar ring, which, however, is\r\n  interrupted at the ventral surface. The four last segments forming\r\n  the tail are smooth, only at the posterior end are there small\r\n  spines. The arrangement of spines of the third stage differs from\r\n  this. Italian workmen that have been employed in Brazil show the\r\n  presence of Dermatobia larvæ on their return (Blanchard, in _Bull.\r\n  Soc. Ent. France_, 1893, p. 24; _Bull. Soc. centr. de Méd. vet._,\r\n  1896; _Ann. Soc. Ent. France_, 1894, lxiii, p. 142; Ward, H. B., in\r\n  Mark Annivers. Vol., Article 25, p. 483, New York, 1903).\r\n\r\n[420] Duprey advances the opinion that Dermatobia deposits its eggs not\r\nonly on the skin of man and animals, but also on the leaves and twigs\r\nin the bush, where, too, young larvæ have been met with which gain\r\naccess from hence to men and animals (_Journ. Trop. Med. and Hyg._,\r\n1906).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 412.--_Dermatobia noxialis_, Goudot.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 413.--Larva of _Dermatobia cyaniventris_ in its\r\nnatural size and magnified.

Oestriden,” 1863, p. 266).\r\n  It is known by various other names, as nuche or gusano in New\r\n  Granada, the ura in Brazil, and the macaw fly in Cayenne. It occurs\r\n  in Central and South America and the West Indies. According to Goudot\r\n  the fly is found in great numbers on the borders of large woods and\r\n  lands covered with underwood.\r\n\r\n  [It is seldom that more than one larva is found in each individual.\r\n  It is generally found in the arm and leg, but now and then the face.\r\n  The perfect insect has never been bred from a larva removed from a\r\n  human being, so that there is still uncertainty as to the actual\r\n  species. _D. cyaniventris_ is 11 to 12 mm. long, has an ochraceous\r\n  buff-coloured face, dark grey thorax, metallic dark blue to purple\r\n  abdomen, and brownish wings. _D. noxialis_ is somewhat larger.\r\n\r\n  [In the _Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene_, January 15, 1905,\r\n  viii, p. 23, reference is made to this Oestrid in Trinidad, where\r\n  it is called the “mosquito worm.” One case here recorded showed no\r\n  fewer than four worms on the chin and one on the hand. It is here\r\n  stated that the fly never attacks man or animals directly, as it is\r\n  said to do by Scheube, but that the eggs are deposited on leaves and\r\n  branches in wooded lands and forests, and thus man, hunting dogs\r\n  and wild animals in passing through get the larvæ deposited on them\r\n  accidentally. The affection is common in Trinidad. Mention is made\r\n  that a little 1 in 40 carbolic lotion syringed into the aperture in\r\n  the skin over the worm quickly killed it.\r\n\r\n  [The cattle worm, or founzaia ngómbe, is the name given to a larva\r\n  which develops beneath the skin of oxen and men in Central Africa,\r\n  especially amongst the natives and stock of Unyamonezi. According to\r\n  P. Dutrieux, the egg is laid by a large fly that accompanies cattle.\r\n  It is unknown between the central plateau or the Ugogo and the East\r\n  Coast.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCAVICOLOUS OESTRIDÆ.\r\n\r\nThe forms belonging to this group inhabit as larvæ the nasal and\r\nfrontal sinuses of ruminants, _Equidæ_ and _Proboscidæ_, which they\r\nleave for the pupal stage. The larva of--\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Oestrus*, Linnæus,\r\n\r\n*Oestrus* (*Cephalomyia*) *ovis*, L.,\r\n\r\noccurring in sheep, has also been observed in man in six cases in the\r\nnose and larynx (Saitta in _Gaz. d. Osp. d. Clinic_, 1903, No. 128). So\r\nfar as is known, the eggs are deposited in the nasal cavity.\r\n\r\n  [_Oestrus ovis_ frequently occurs in man. MM. Sergent (_Ann. de\r\n  l’Inst. Pasteur_, 1907, pp. 392–399) mention that they lay their ova\r\n  on the noses, eyes and mouth of humans in Algeria whilst flying,\r\n  but that they disappear after three to ten days or the inflammation\r\n  produced by them. Portschinsky (_Mem. Bur. Ent. Sci. Com. Cent. Bd.\r\n  Land Adm. and Agric._, 1913, x, No. 3, p. 63) also gives cases. He\r\n  doubts that ova are laid on the nose; evidently the Russian habit is\r\n  anomalous, for the Sergents, Collings and myself find ova laid as a\r\n  common occurrence. I have often seen them on the nose of sheep. This\r\n  fly also occurs in the Argentine (Serres, in _Gaceta Rural_, April,\r\n  1913, vi, pp. 759–761).\r\n\r\n  [The tamné or thimni of the Kabyles, a human myiasis of the Tuareg\r\n  mountains in the Sahara, is caused by _Oestrus ovis_. Here the larvæ\r\n  are said to be ejected on to the conjunctival and nasal mucous\r\n  membrane of humans.\r\n\r\n  [Ed. and Lt. Sergent (_Bull. Soc. Path. exot._, 1913, vi, No. 7,\r\n  pp. 487–488) report their attack from the Ahaggar mountains, in\r\n  Central Sahara. The Tuareg name for the fly, tamné, is the Targui\r\n  form of the word thimni used by the Kabyles.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGASTRICOLOUS OESTRIDÆ.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are deposited on the hairs of _Equidæ_, and the larvæ escaping\r\nfrom them are licked up and swallowed. They pass their larval stage,\r\naccording to the species, in various parts of the intestine and\r\nstomach, and when mature, pass out _per anum_ in order to undergo the\r\npupal stage.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Gastrophilus*, Leach.\r\n\r\n  One of the most frequent species is _Gastrophilus equi_, Fabr.;\r\n  the eggs are laid on the hairs; the larvæ live some ten months in\r\n  the stomach, living attached to the inner surface. The eggs of _G.\r\n  hæmorrhoidalis_, L., are deposited on the lips or the long hairs on\r\n  them. The larvæ adhere to the cardiac end of the stomach, to the\r\n  stomach itself, and finally to the terminal portion of the intestine.\r\n  Here, however, and elsewhere in the intestine, the larvæ of _G.\r\n  pecorum_, Fabr., are also met with, whilst the larvæ of _G. nasalis_\r\n  (so called because the eggs are deposited in the nasal orifices)\r\n  almost exclusively inhabit the anterior section of the duodenum.\r\n\r\n  Cholodkowsky attributes the “wormlet” observed by Samson and Sokolew\r\n  (_Wratsch_, 1895, Nos. 48 and 57) and others (_ibid._, 1896–98)\r\n  to _Gastrophilus_ larvæ. It burrows into the epidermis of man by\r\n  minute passages. This observation should, however, be verified.

The importance of these parasites is not\r\n  the mere fact that they feed upon our blood, but that they often\r\n  carry germs from man to man (tsetse-flies and trypanosomiasis,\r\n  _Tabanidæ_ and anthrax). Amongst the most important biting-mouthed\r\n  _Diptera_ in this section are the following: _Tabanidæ_, or\r\n  gad-flies; _Glossinæ_, or tsetse-flies; and certain other _Muscidæ_.\r\n  Some of the exotic _Asilidæ_ and a few _Leptidæ_ also bite man.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Tabanidæ* (Gad-flies).\r\n\r\n  [The _Tabanidæ_ have a broad, rather flattened body and a large head;\r\n  eyes united in the male (except in some Chrysops). The antennæ are\r\n  composed of three segments, have the third joint composed of five\r\n  to eight annuli--in Chrysops they are fairly long. The proboscis is\r\n  projecting, and sometimes much elongated. The legs are moderately\r\n  stout. The venation of the wings is shown in fig. 415.\r\n\r\n  [This family of gad or horse flies contains a great number of genera,\r\n  all of which may bite animals and man more or less severely. The\r\n  female alone is blood-sucking, the males feed upon the juices of\r\n  flowers. The females deposit their spindle-shaped white, black,\r\n  or brown eggs on leaves, stems of plants that either overhang or\r\n  stand in water, and amongst rushes; they are at first white, but\r\n  become brown or black. The eggs are laid in rounded, flattened or\r\n  conical masses composed of layers one upon the other. The larvæ are\r\n  carnivorous, feeding upon snails, worms, other larvæ, etc., and have\r\n  a distinct head; they are cylindrical, composed of eleven segments,\r\n  the last with a vertical breathing pore, or the last two segments may\r\n  form a breathing tube. The majority taper to a point at each end, in\r\n  colour shining white or dull grey to yellowish, many of the larger\r\n  specimens mottled or banded with dark brown or black. The first seven\r\n  abdominal segments are encircled near the anterior margin with a\r\n  ring of fleshy protuberances consisting of a transverse dorsal ridge\r\n  which may be divided by a depression into two. The young larvæ burrow\r\n  into any soft vegetable substance; they live both in the water and\r\n  under damp soil surrounding water, also in damp earth generally. The\r\n  larvæ are not only carnivorous, but they are cannibals, frequently\r\n  devouring their own species. They may take more than a year to mature.\r\n\r\n  [The pupæ are found close to the surface of mud and earth, and are\r\n  mostly dull yellowish to brown in colour, with rows of spines on the\r\n  distal third of each abdominal segment; the thorax bears a pair of\r\n  ear-shaped spiracular structures, and there are also six denticles at\r\n  the apex of the abdomen.\r\n\r\n  [A habit common to the adults of most of the _Tabanidæ_ of\r\n  considerable economic importance is that of the adults coming to\r\n  water to drink. Portschinsky[421] has found that by applying kerosene\r\n  to the pool they frequent the adults are killed, and Hine[422] that\r\n  the same oil kills the larvæ that fall into the water from eggs laid\r\n  on plants above.\r\n\r\n[421] _Vide Bull._ 20, _N. Sc., U.S. Div. Ent._\r\n\r\n[422] “_Tabanidæ_ of Ohio,” _Ohio State University Bull._ 19, 1903,\r\nsec. 7, p. 14.\r\n\r\n  [_Tabanidæ_ are not only of importance as purely biting insects,\r\n  for they may often convey pathogenic organisms from one animal to\r\n  another, such as the bacillus of anthrax, which they are known to\r\n  carry, and possibly also trypanosomes in regard to man. Chrysops also\r\n  acts as a host of _Filaria loa_ in South Nigeria (Leiper, _Brit. Med.\r\n  Journ._, January, 1912, pp. 39–40). Two species are incriminated,\r\n  _viz._, _C. silacea_ and _C. dimidiata_. With animals these flies\r\n  play a more important part, for MM. Sergent, in Algeria, have proved\r\n  that species of Tabanus are able to transmit three forms of animal\r\n  trypanosomes by biting a healthy animal as long as twenty-two hours\r\n  after having bitten an unhealthy one. In India they have also been\r\n  shown to transmit the parasite of “surra” in dogs and rabbits by\r\n  Rogers. Other observers have since corroborated these results,\r\n  and Mitzmain, who has recently performed valuable work in this\r\n  connection, states that _T. striatus_ is undoubtedly the carrier\r\n  of this disease in the Philippine Islands. Certain members of the\r\n  genus Hæmatopota have also been shown to be capable of the direct\r\n  transmission of _Trypanosoma evansi._ Martoglio (_Ann. d’Ig. sper._,\r\n  1913, xxiii, N.S., No. 3, pp. 363–366) states that the trypanosome\r\n  disease of dromedaries known as salaf is transmitted by _Tabanidæ_,\r\n  especially Pangonia (_P. magretti_ and _P. beckeri_) in Italian\r\n  Somaliland. It is quite likely that these flies play a much greater\r\n  part in the spread of such diseases than is imagined at the present\r\n  time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 415.--The ox gad fly (_Tabanus bovinus_, Linn.).]\r\n\r\n  [The _Tabanidæ_ are divided into two groups or subfamilies: (1) The\r\n  _Pangoninæ_, and (2) the _Tabaninæ_; the former have spurs on the\r\n  hind tibiæ and usually ocelli; the latter have neither tibial spurs\r\n  nor ocelli.\r\n\r\n  [The _Pangoninæ_ contain two main genera, Pangonia and Chrysops. In\r\n  the former the proboscis is much elongated, and the third antennal\r\n  segment is composed of eight rings, and is never angulated or\r\n  ungulated at the base. The proboscis is often very long.\r\n\r\n  [In Chrysops, the so-called blinding storm flies, all the three\r\n  segments of the antennæ are long, the third having only five\r\n  annulations, and the proboscis short but very strong.\r\n\r\n  [There are many genera in the _Tabaninæ_, which are found in all\r\n  parts of the world, of which two only are shown here--_viz._,\r\n  Tabanus and Hæmatopota. The former has the first two segments of the\r\n  antennæ short, the third angulated at the base, sometimes spurred\r\n  and composed of five annulations; the second has the second segment\r\n  short, and the third composed of four annulations--never angulated\r\n  nor spurred at the base--and the wings are adorned with grey or brown\r\n  markings. These latter are usually called “brimps” and “clegs” in\r\n  Britain, the former gad or horse flies, the seruts and mangrove flies\r\n  of tropical countries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 416.--The brimp (_Hæmatopota pluvialis_, Linn.).]\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Asilidæ* (Wolf Flies).\r\n\r\n  [These flies are of little importance in regard to the subject dealt\r\n  with in this book; but I have notes sent concerning the biting habits\r\n  of one or more species belonging to this family from the Malay States\r\n  and Africa.\r\n\r\n  [_Asilidæ_, or wolf flies, are easily told by the following\r\n  characters: Large or moderate-sized flies, thickly hairy; head\r\n  separated from thorax by a narrow neck; eyes separated in both\r\n  sexes; proboscis firm and horny, adapted for piercing; abdomen long,\r\n  pointed, and composed of eight segments. Legs strong and bristly,\r\n  of moderate length. Wings sometimes mottled, lying parallel over\r\n  the abdomen when at rest. There are nearly 3,000 species. They live\r\n  mostly upon insects, but some are said to bite animals and man. They\r\n  are, however, of little importance in this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Leptidæ.*\r\n\r\n  [This widely distributed family of flies has a few species which suck\r\n  the blood of man, and the writer has been personally badly bitten in\r\n  Norway by a Leptis which was apparently _Leptis scolopacea_.\r\n\r\n  [The _Leptidæ_ have usually blotched wings and similar venation to\r\n  Tabanus; they are elongated flies of moderate or large size, and of\r\n  dull colours. The antennæ are varied and consist of three segments,\r\n  either with or without a terminal bristle or with the third segment\r\n  compound, and in a few they may be almost nematocerous. The wing\r\n  veins are distinct, very crowded anteriorly, the third long vein is\r\n  furcate, basal cells large, and there are usually five posterior\r\n  cells, the anal cell being open in some; the squamæ are always small,\r\n  sometimes only rudimentary.\r\n\r\n  [Four are known to be blood-suckers, namely the American\r\n  Symphoromyia, _Trichopalpus obscurus_ in Chili, and _Leptis strigosa_\r\n  and _L. scolopacea_ in Europe. The genus Symphoromyia has a single\r\n  spur on the hind tibiæ, none on the fore or mid tibiæ, the third\r\n  segment of the three-ringed antennæ kidney-shaped, and a short\r\n  proboscis. In the genus Leptis the hind tibiæ have two spurs, and the\r\n  third antennal segment is not reniform.\r\n\r\n  [The other biting genus Trichopalpus can be told at once by the\r\n  elongated proboscis. Most of this family live upon other insects. The\r\n  larvæ live in earth, decaying wood, sand, stagnant waters, and the\r\n  nests of wood-boring beetles; they are usually cylindrical and may\r\n  have fleshy abdominal legs; the anal segment has a transverse cleft,\r\n  and often two posteriorly directed processes and two stigmata between\r\n  them. They are all predaceous, and in one genus (Vermileo) make\r\n  pitfalls in sand like the ant lions (_Myrmeleon_).\r\n\r\n\r\nBlood-sucking Muscidæ.\r\n\r\n  [The blood-sucking _Muscidæ_ are mainly contained in the following\r\n  genera: Glossina, Stomoxys, Hæmatobia, Lyperosia, Stygeromyia,\r\n  Philæmatomyia and Bdellolarynx.\r\n\r\n  [The first is the most important genus on account of the part it\r\n  plays in the spread of trypanosome diseases. Stomoxys may also serve\r\n  as a disease carrier. The remainder and a few more genera cause\r\n  considerable annoyance by their bites, and may also act as occasional\r\n  carriers of pathogenic organisms. All these flies have their mouth\r\n  parts elongated to some extent, forming a distinct proboscis, which\r\n  becomes more or less strongly chitinized; the labella are usually\r\n  serrated or spiny, and thus form a structure easily capable of\r\n  piercing the skin. Unlike the _Culicidæ_, the blood-sucking _Muscidæ_\r\n  have the sanguinary habit common to both sexes.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Glossina*, Westwood.\r\n\r\n  [This genus contains sixteen species,[423] all of which are\r\n  confined to the Ethiopian region. Glossina may be distinguished\r\n  from other allied genera by the proboscis, the antennæ, wings, and\r\n  male genitalia. The proboscis projects forwards and has a swollen\r\n  bulb-like base to the slender labium which holds the two structures,\r\n  the needle-like epipharynx and the thread-like hypopharynx; the whole\r\n  proboscis is ensheathed in the maxillary palpi. The antennæ have the\r\n  first two segments small, the third large with a marked pore, the\r\n  orifice of the sense organ near the base; from the base of the third\r\n  segment also arises the three-jointed arista, the first two segments\r\n  being, however, minute; the third bears a series of from seventeen\r\n  to twenty-one fine branched hairs on one side. The male genitalia or\r\n  hypopygium is more or less oval and tumid, its long axis lying in the\r\n  antero-posterior direction, with a vulviform median groove (the anus)\r\n  running from the anterior margin to beyond the middle.\r\n\r\n[423] This does not include _G. maculata_, Newstead, which is regarded\r\nby Austen as a synonym of _G. palpalis_, Rob. Des.; according to this\r\nauthority the curiously spotted appearance of the type and only example\r\nof _G. maculata_ is due to foreign matter.\r\n\r\n  [Newstead has shown the importance of the study of the genitalia\r\n  in separating species (_vide_ _Bull. Ent. Res._, ii, pp. 9–36 and\r\n  107–110, and iii, pp. 355–360; and _Ann. Trop.

The\r\n  female produces at each birth a single full-grown larva, which is\r\n  retained within the oviduct and there nourished by the secretion of\r\n  special glands, and on being born crawls to some hiding place and at\r\n  once becomes a puparium.\r\n\r\n  [The larva is a yellowish footless maggot nearly as large as the\r\n  mother’s body, the skin shagreened and the anal extremity having a\r\n  pair of large, black, granular prominences separated by a depression\r\n  containing the breathing pores.\r\n\r\n  [The puparium is brown of various shades, the tumid lips of the\r\n  larva being conspicuous, the size and shape of the lips enabling the\r\n  puparia to be identified.\r\n\r\n  [These puparia are often found in masses at the base of trees,\r\n  in hollows in trees and rocks just buried under vegetal debris.\r\n  These insects are generally confined to definite tracts known as\r\n  “fly-belts.” They usually occur in damp, hot places on the borders\r\n  of rivers and lakes, and never far from water in the case of the\r\n  _palpalis_ group, although others of the _morsitans_ group may be\r\n  found a considerable distance from water. They are usually absent\r\n  on grass plains, but may now and then occur there (Kinghorn, _vide_\r\n  Hindles’ “Flies and Disease, Blood-sucking Flies,” 1914, p. 274);\r\n  cover of trees, shrubs, or thick reeds is essential to them.\r\n\r\n  [Their range in Africa extends roughly from 18° N. to 31° S.\r\n\r\n  [_Glossina palpalis_ is the chief carrier of the more prevalent type\r\n  of sleeping sickness. Two distinct types of parasites can produce\r\n  this disease, _viz._, _Trypanosoma gambiense_, which produces the\r\n  ordinary sleeping sickness, transmitted by _G. palpalis_, and\r\n  _Trypanosoma rhodesiense_ the Rhodesian or Nyasaland sleeping\r\n  sickness, transmitted by _G. morsitans_, and possibly identical with\r\n  _T. brucei_, the parasite of N’agana. Koch has also shown that _G.\r\n  pallidipes_, Austen, and _G. fusca_, Walker, can be artificially\r\n  infected with the human trypanosome.

Desv.\r\n\r\n  [This is the chief carrier of sleeping sickness in Nature. It\r\n  is found in places over the whole of West Africa from the mouth\r\n  of the Senegal River to Angola, and extends eastwards into the\r\n  Bahr-el-Ghazal. The eastern boundary follows the valley of the Nile\r\n  and includes the eastern shores of Lakes Victoria and Tanganyika;\r\n  from the southern end of the lake the boundary tends south-west,\r\n  approximately following the frontier between North-eastern Rhodesia\r\n  and the Congo Free State, and passing through the Katanga district\r\n  of the latter country into Angola (Austen). It may occur up to\r\n  3,000 ft.; but, according to Bagshawe, it has not been recorded above\r\n  4,000 ft. It feeds on the blood of many animals, including reptiles,\r\n  amphibia, birds, and even amphibious fishes, as well as all the wild\r\n  mammals. It seems, however, to possess a decided predilection for\r\n  man, and undoubtedly thrives better upon mammals and birds than upon\r\n  cold-blooded animals.\r\n\r\n  [It is not usually found far from water, requiring a humid atmosphere\r\n  and temperature of about 85° F. (shade). But a marked seasonal\r\n  distribution is shown, the flies considerably extending their range\r\n  during the rainy season, and thus visiting districts which are\r\n  dry for the greater part of the year; as the rains diminish the\r\n  fly gradually leaves the temporary haunts and returns to the more\r\n  permanent ones. It bites only by day, and then only in sunny weather,\r\n  and usually lives in shade.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 419.--_Glossina palpalis_ and puparium. (After\r\n  Brumpt.)]\r\n\r\n  [Roubaud has shown that the first larva produced is about three\r\n  weeks after copulation, and that others are produced at an interval\r\n  of nine or ten days. The puparium stage is rapidly produced after\r\n  the expulsion of the larva, often in three-quarters of an hour. The\r\n  puparium stage lasts from thirty-two to thirty-five days. The puparia\r\n  occur in well-drained humus close to water, sheltered by trees or\r\n  bushes, in crevices in rocks, and between the exposed roots of trees,\r\n  sometimes in sand.\r\n\r\n  [Bruce has shown that only a very small percentage of flies fed\r\n  experimentally on infected animals ultimately become infective, and\r\n  that the infectivity of this small percentage depends upon a delayed\r\n  infection of the salivary glands.\r\n\r\n  [A variety, _wellmani_ of Austen, is found in Angola, Gambia, the\r\n  Katanga district of the Congo Free State, the Matondwi Islands of\r\n  Tanganyika, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Glossina morsitans*, Westwood.\r\n\r\n  [This species has been shown by Kinghorn and Yorke, and also by\r\n  Bruce, to be responsible for the transmission of _Trypanosoma\r\n  rhodesiense_, the micro-organism producing sleeping sickness in man\r\n  in Rhodesia and Nyasaland and also in parts of German and Portuguese\r\n  East Africa. Fisher and Taute have demonstrated experimentally\r\n  that _Trypanosoma gambiense_--the sleeping sickness parasite of\r\n  other parts of Africa--may also be transmitted by this fly, and in\r\n  addition it is known to be capable of disseminating several species\r\n  of trypanosomes pathogenic to animals. Of these, _T. brucei_ (=? _T.\r\n  rhodesiense_), the parasite of tsetse disease, first incriminated by\r\n  Bruce, is perhaps the most important.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 420.--The tsetse-fly (_Glossina morsitans_,\r\n  Westwood).]\r\n\r\n  [It is the most widely spread of all tsetse-flies; its range\r\n  extends from Senegambia in the north-west to Southern Kordofan and\r\n  Southern Abyssinia in the north-east, and then southwards to the\r\n  Bechuanaland Protectorate, North-eastern Transvaal and Zululand. The\r\n  actual localities given by Austen are Gambia, French Guinea, Gold\r\n  Coast, Togoland, Dahomey, Northern Nigeria, Congo Free State, the\r\n  Bahr-el-Ghazal, the Uganda Protectorate, German East Africa, and\r\n  Portuguese East Africa.\r\n\r\n  [This species is confined to “belts,” often of very limited extent,\r\n  and appears to prefer regions where there is sufficient vegetation\r\n  for moderate but not excessive cover and a hot, moderately dry\r\n  climate. It is not nearly so dependent upon water as is _G.\r\n  palpalis_, and generally is most active in a dry atmosphere; some\r\n  observers, however, state that in certain districts it is more common\r\n  along the banks and edges of rivers. This tsetse-fly has been taken\r\n  as high as 5,500 ft. altitude. It infests native villages as well\r\n  as the bush. Like other tsetse-flies it bites not only during the\r\n  hottest part of the day, but also on bright warm moonlight nights,\r\n  and it feeds on the blood of all mammals.\r\n\r\n  [The structure of the male genitalia of those representatives of _G.\r\n  morsitans_ occurring on the West Coast of Africa and in parts of the\r\n  Soudan presents certain constant differences from that of the typical\r\n  form of this species; this form is known as _G. morsitans_, race\r\n  _submorsitans_, Newst.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Stomoxys*, Geoffroy.\r\n\r\n  [The members of this genus which occur in temperate and tropical\r\n  countries are provided with a hard, slender, shiny black proboscis\r\n  which projects horizontally from beneath the head; by means of this\r\n  structure they can bite severely. In general appearance they resemble\r\n  house flies, but the proboscis at once distinguishes them. In many\r\n  parts of Britain they are known as storm flies on account of their\r\n  frequent appearance indoors previous to a storm of rain or wind,\r\n  which I have invariably found to be correct; they are also called\r\n  stinging flies. In colour they are greyish, dusky or brownish-grey\r\n  or black, varying from 5 to 7 mm. in length; the thorax has dark\r\n  longitudinal stripes and the abdomen dark spots or bands. In the male\r\n  the eyes are closer together than in the female. These flies usually\r\n  occur in stables and farmyards, along woods and in lanes, and mainly\r\n  attack mammals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 421.--The stinging fly (_Stomoxys calcitrans_,\r\nLinn.).]\r\n\r\n  [One species (_Stomoxys calcitrans_, Linnæus) occurs practically all\r\n  over the world. The female lays her eggs in moist, warm, decaying\r\n  vegetation; as many as eighty may be laid by a single female. The\r\n  ova are white, banana-shaped, with a broad groove on the shorter\r\n  curvature; they may hatch in two or three days. The creamy-white\r\n  larva tapers to a point at the head end, and is truncated at the\r\n  tail end. Two black mouth hooks are plainly visible at the cephalic\r\n  extremity. There are two plates on the posterior surface of the last\r\n  segment which bear the respiratory pores, nearly circular in outline.\r\n  It reaches maturity in fourteen to twenty-one days; when mature it\r\n  is 11 mm. long. The pupal stage is passed in the old larva skin and\r\n  lasts from nine to thirteen days; it is barrel-shaped, 5 to 8 mm.\r\n  long, and of a bright reddish-brown to dark chestnut-brown colour.\r\n\r\n  [This insect may act as a carrier of anthrax, and has been proved to\r\n  be the agent of an extensive epidemic of malignant pustule in the\r\n  Isle of Pines, New Caledonia.[425]\r\n\r\n[425] _Bull. des Séances de la Soc. ent. de France_, 1878, pp. cxliv,\r\ncxlv.\r\n\r\n  [Noè’s[426] experiments tend to show that it is an intermediate host\r\n  and transmitter of _Filaria labiato-papillosa_ of the ox.\r\n\r\n[426] _Atti della Reale Accad. dei Lincei, Anno CCC.

Others have also been\r\n  unsuccessful. Certainly Stomoxys can transmit the disease in French\r\n  West Africa (Bonet and Roubaud), and mechanically has been proved\r\n  to be capable of disseminating other trypanosomes (experimentally):\r\n  sleeping sickness (_T. gambiense_); nagana (_T. brucei_); souma (_T.\r\n  cazalboui_); and el debat (_T. soudanense_).\r\n\r\n  [_S. calcitrans_ may also be a carrier of poliomyelitis (Rosenau and\r\n  Brues, _Harvard Alumni Bulletin_, 1912, xv, No. 9, pp. 140–142).\r\n  Several species are now known (_S. brunnipes_, Grünb.; _S. inornata_,\r\n  Grünb.; _S. nigra_, Macq.; _S. omega_, Newst.; _S. ochrosoma_,\r\n  Speiser, etc.).\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus. *Lyperosia*, Rondani.\r\n\r\n  [A genus of small flies which bite man and animals, but are not so\r\n  far connected with the transmission of any disease in man, but in\r\n  Java it appears to carry surra (P. Schat, _Meeledeel Praefstation\r\n  Oost-Java_, 1903, 3e ser., No. 44), the species being _Lyperosia\r\n  exigua_, Meijere. These flies can be told from Stomoxys by the palpi\r\n  being broader, flattened laterally, and as long, or nearly so, as the\r\n  proboscis. When not feeding the palpi enclose the proboscis, as in\r\n  Glossina. They are usually about half the size of Stomoxys, and are\r\n  the smallest blood-sucking _Muscidæ_. They frequently swarm around\r\n  and upon domesticated animals.\r\n\r\n  [The life-history of the horn fly in America (_L. irritans_, Linn.)\r\n  is well known. It lays its ova singly in freshly dropped cow-dung,\r\n  and there the maggots feed, pupating in the soil beneath.\r\n\r\n  [Patton and Cragg also give some details as to the life-history of\r\n  _Liperosia exigua_ (“Medical Entomology,” p. 375) as follows: “_L.\r\n  exigua_, whose habits have been observed in Madras, usually lays\r\n  twelve eggs at a time. The flies immediately return to the cow and\r\n  the process is repeated when the dung is again dropped. The larvæ\r\n  migrate from the dung when about to pupate, and the puparia are\r\n  always found in the earth at some distance away or under the sides of\r\n  the patch of dung. The fly usually hatches out in five days, though\r\n  sometimes as late as the eighth. Weiss has studied the life-history\r\n  of _irritans_ var. _weisii_ from Algeria; its larval stage lasts five\r\n  days, and the flies hatch out of the puparia in another five days.”\r\n\r\n  [The other biting genera of _Muscidæ_, Hæmatobia, Hæmatobosca,\r\n  Bdellolarynx, Stygeromyia, and Philæmatomyia, although sometimes\r\n  annoying to man, have not in any way been connected with any disease.\r\n\r\n  [The horse fly (_Hæmatobia irritans_, L.[427]) attacks cattle\r\n  chiefly, but now and then man is bitten. The different species can be\r\n  told from Stomoxys by the palpi being nearly as long as the proboscis.\r\n\r\n[427] This is apparently the _stimulans_ of Meigen.\r\n\r\n  [The genus *Philæmatomyia*, Austen, is intermediate between Stomoxys\r\n  and Musca in structure, and between the non-blood-sucking Musca, as\r\n  _M. domestica_, and the blood-sucking _Musca pattoni_, Austen, which\r\n  feeds on the blood exuding from the bites of true blood-suckers. They\r\n  occur in Central Africa and India, Ceylon and Cyprus (_vide_ “The\r\n  Life-history of _Philæmatomyia insignis_, Austen,” _Ann. Trop. Med.\r\n  and Par._, 1912, v, p. 515).\r\n\r\n  [Two flies belonging to the family *Anthomyidæ* also attack man,\r\n  namely:--\r\n\r\n  [_Hydrotæa meteorica_, L. (the meteoric fly). This fly attacks man as\r\n  well as animals. They especially bite around the eyes and nostrils\r\n  of animals, but are not so particular with man; the head, however,\r\n  is usually chosen. Linnæus called it the meteoric fly because it\r\n  often forms clouds around horses’ heads at the approach of rain. The\r\n  Hydrotæas are usually black or blue-black in colour with bare eyes\r\n  and simple abdomen, the front femora peculiarly constructed. _H.\r\n  meteorica_, L., occurs in Britain.\r\n\r\n  [The members of the genus Hydrophoria, Desvoidy, also bite man.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Pupipara* or *Eproboscidæ*.\r\n\r\n  [The _Pupipara_ are all blood-suckers, the majority occurring as\r\n  parasites on mammals and birds, where they are more or less permanent\r\n  parasites. Occasionally some may attack man. They all produce their\r\n  young fully formed, and they assume the pupal stage immediately\r\n  after extrusion. The puparia are large. They are mostly flat,\r\n  louse-like flies which may or may not be winged. In the case of\r\n  Melophagus I have found the puparia are often passed by the female.\r\n  The winged forms have a short quick flight, and when disturbed will\r\n  seek shelter in man’s hair or beard. Two main families occur: (1)\r\n  the _Hippoboscidæ_, and (2) the _Nycteribiidæ_. The former occur on\r\n  animals and birds, the latter on bats only, but may invade man. Two\r\n  other families are known--the _Braulidæ_ (bee parasites) and the\r\n  _Streblidæ_ (bat parasites).\r\n\r\n  [The mouth of the _Hippoboscidæ_ is long and sharp, forming a\r\n  proboscis. The thorax and abdomen are flat and leathery. The legs\r\n  are stout and strong, and terminate in large dentate claws and other\r\n  structures of use in holding on to the hair or feathers of their host\r\n  when blood-sucking.\r\n\r\n  [Austen says it is probable that the _Hippoboscidæ_ are descended\r\n  from ancestors belonging to the _Muscidæ_, which underwent\r\n  modification in bodily structure as the consequence of the adoption\r\n  of a parasitic mode of life.\r\n\r\n  [Two wings are present in the true Hippoboscæ, _Hippobosca equina_\r\n  (of the horse), _H. camelina_ (of the camel), _H. maculata_ (of\r\n  oxen), and _H. capensis_ (of dogs), but are absent in Melophagus, the\r\n  sheep tick or ked fly (_M. ovinus_).\r\n\r\n  [In two genera, Lipoptena and Echestypus, wings are at first present,\r\n  but are lost as soon as the fly finds its permanent host.\r\n\r\n  [With regard to their biting man, such is only occasional. I have\r\n  known sheep shearers to be badly bitten by _Melophagus ovinus_, and\r\n  have more than once been attacked myself when standing where shearing\r\n  is taking place. Sharp records the grouse parasite, _Ornithomyia\r\n  lagopodis_, as once biting severely a gamekeeper in Scotland. There\r\n  are also records of _H. maculata_ biting man in Africa and India.\r\n\r\n  [Although so far not connected with any human disease, it is\r\n  interesting to note Theiler has shown that _Hippobosca rufipes_,\r\n  v. Olfers, and _H. maculata_, Leach, are capable of transmitting\r\n  _Trypanosoma theileri_, Laveran, the cause of gall sickness amongst\r\n  cattle in the Transvaal. It is now considered, however, that\r\n  _Trypanosoma theileri_ is non-pathogenic, and that the cause of\r\n  gall sickness is a piroplasma-like organism known as _Anaplasma\r\n  marginale_. Theiler, Laveran and Mesnil all hold this view (_vide_\r\n  Laveran and Mesnil, “Trypanosomes and Trypanosomiases,” second\r\n  edition, 1912, p. 330).\r\n\r\n  [_Lynchia._--Three members of this genus have been shown to transmit\r\n  the non-pathogenic (?) organism, _Hæmoproteus columbæ_ amongst\r\n  pigeons in Algeria and S.

Field work during\r\n  the past summer, together with a consideration of the epidemiology\r\n  of the disease so far known, points strongly towards biting flies\r\n  as possible carriers of the virus. It seems probable that the\r\n  common stable fly (_Stomoxys calcitrans_, L.) may be responsible to\r\n  a certain extent for the spread of acute epidemic poliomyelitis,\r\n  possibly aided by other biting flies such as _Tabanus lineola_. No\r\n  facts which disprove such a hypothesis have as yet been adduced, and\r\n  experiments based upon it are now in progress.\r\n\r\n  [If the disease should prove to be common to any species of domestic\r\n  animals, as is now strongly suspected, a secondary connection of\r\n  ticks in spreading the disease among such animals seems probable, as\r\n  has been mentioned.\r\n\r\n  [The following is some of the more important literature on\r\n  _Diptera_ in general: Meigen, J. W., “Syst.

This he traced either to a\r\nmite or tick. He figures the possible carriers, namely, a Trombidium\r\nand _Cheyletidæ_.

He states that a young child, perfectly\r\nwell one day, has more or less complete paresis or paralysis on the\r\nnext, fever, a rapid pulse, and other constitutional symptoms. The\r\nchild may be dull and stupid, and may have convulsions. If the tick\r\nis not found and removed the child may die, but if it is removed, the\r\nsymptoms disappear and recovery is complete in a few hours. The tick\r\nmust be entirely removed.\r\n\r\n*Diptera.*--PSYCHODIDÆ: Bolt (_China Med.

The\r\nspecies of Phlebotomus has not been determined.\r\n\r\n*Pulicidæ.*--DERMATOPHILUS (SARCOPSYLLA) PENETRANS, OR THE\r\n“JIGGER.”--This flea (_vide_ p. 544) is believed by Lama (_Giorn. Ital.\r\nMal. Ven._, Milan, 1914, xlix, pp. 465–472) frequently to carry leprosy\r\nand he points out that the early lesions of leprosy usually appear on\r\nthe uncovered parts of the body. This flea also attacks rats.\r\n\r\n*Brachycera.*--LEPTIDÆ (_vide_ p. 603): White, A. (“The\r\n_Diptera-Brachycera_ of Tasmania,” part I, _Papers and Proc. Roy. Soc.\r\nof Tasmania_ for 1914, 1915, pp. 35–74), describes a new blood-sucking\r\nLeptid, _Spaniopsis tabaniformis_, which resembles a small gad fly\r\n(Tabanus) in appearance.\r\n\r\n_Pycnosoma putorium_: This is believed by Roubaud (“Les Producteurs de\r\nMyiases et Agents similaires chez l’homme et les animaux,” Paris, 1914,\r\npart I) to be largely concerned in the spread of amœbic dysentery in\r\nFrench West Africa.\r\n\r\n_Lucilia argyrocephala_, Macquart: This green-bottle fly is described\r\nby Roubaud as producing myiasis in Africa (“Les Producteurs de Myiases\r\net Agents similaires chez l’homme et les animaux,” 1914, Paris, part\r\nI). It attacks ulcers and sores in man and animals.\r\n\r\n_Auchmeromyia luteola_, Fabr.: Schwetz (_Ann. Trop. Med. and Par._,\r\n1914, viii, No. 3, pp. 497–507), collected a large quantity of this\r\ninsect at Kabinda. He placed them in flasks with sand and a few days\r\nlater they pupated, and in fifteen days several flies hatched out. The\r\nlarval period varies from an unknown minimum up to several months.\r\nThe larva may live for at least two months without food. A female\r\noviposited on the 17th, and on the 18th one larva hatched. The pupal\r\nstage seems to last eight to fifteen days. The larvæ appear to bite by\r\nday as well as night according to native information.\r\n\r\n_Cordylobia anthropophaga_, Grünb.: Roubaud (“Etudes sur la Faune\r\nparasitaire de l’Afrique occidentale française,” part I, “Les\r\nProducteurs des Myiases et Agents similaires chez l’homme et les\r\nanimaux,” Paris, 1914) gives the life-history of this species. One\r\nfly laid 150 ova in a glass vessel, on the sides, and on some rotten\r\nfruit, and died the following day. He found that fifteen larvæ just\r\nhatched placed on sand in a glass vessel with a guinea-pig gave rise\r\nto characteristic tumours on the ventral surface of the body and the\r\nanus. Other experiments failed. It thus seems that infection takes\r\nplace from larvæ which have hatched apart from the host. Infection of\r\nman is regarded as accidental; no positive infection of horses, oxen,\r\nsheep or pigs is known--it is rare in goats, and poultry never seem to\r\nbe attacked. The result of experiments tends to show that the apparent\r\nchoice of a host is mainly a question of body temperature. The larva,\r\nwhether freshly emerged or eight to ten days old, penetrates the skin\r\nimmediately, boring obliquely between the epidermis and dermis. Once\r\nremoved from the tumour the maggot cannot bore again. The first moult\r\ntakes place about three days after penetration, and the total period of\r\nresidence in the host is seven to eight days. Upon emerging the larva\r\nfalls to the ground and buries itself. In two or three days it pupates\r\nand this stage lasts no longer than twenty days. High temperatures,\r\nsuch as 95° F., appear to be fatal.\r\n\r\n*Myiasis.*--Coates, G. M., “A Case of Myiasis Aurium accompanying the\r\nRadical Mastoid Operation,” _Journ. Amer. Med. Assoc._, Chicago, Ill.,\r\n1914, lxiii, pp. 479–480: Apparently _C. macellaria_, forty to fifty\r\ncoming away with the gauze after the operation.\r\n\r\nHuber, G. U., and Flack, F. L., “An Unusual Case of Screw-worms in the\r\nNose and Nasal Accessory Sinuses,” _Journ.

Gioenia_, Catania, 1914, No. 31, pp.\r\n15–23. This writer mentions the following parasites in the human ear:\r\n_Sarcophaga carnaría_, L.; _Wohlfartia magnifica_, Schiner; _Chrysomyia\r\nmacellaria_, F.; _Calliphora vomitoria_, L.; and _Anthomyia pluvialis_,\r\nL. He refers to a severe myiasis in Russia, due to a fly variously\r\nrecorded as _Sarcophaga wohlfarti_, Rond.; _S. ruralis_, Meig.; or\r\n_Sarcophila meigeni_, Portsch. These are all probably synonyms of _W.\r\nmagnifica_. _Chrysomyia macellaria_, in Central America and South\r\nAmerica, is quite as harmful as _S. carnaria_, causing perforation of\r\nthe tympanum and meningitis. _Lucilia nobilis_ and _L. cæsar_ have also\r\nbeen incriminated. Of the sub-family _Anthomyinæ_, the larvæ of _Fannia\r\nscalaris_, Meig., _F. canicularis_, Meig., _F. incisurata_, Zett, and\r\n_Hydrotæa meteorica_, L., are chiefly associated with myiasis. He\r\nrecommends, if the larvæ are outside the tympanum, an injection of\r\nchloroform vapour by a few drops of water saturated with chloroform,\r\nby an emulsion of 5 per cent. carbon bisulphide or with benzine. When\r\ndetached they may be removed with forceps or a solution of boric acid.\r\nIf the tympanum has been perforated, the larvæ must be removed at once.\r\n\r\nFrancaviglia also records the larva of _Oestrus ovis_ in the human ear\r\n(_Boll. Sedute Accad. Gioenia_, Catania, 1914, No. 31, pp. 23–27).\r\n\r\n*Body, Head, and Clothes Lice.*--Lobaczewski (_Wien. klin.\r\nWochenschr._, Vienna, 1915, xxviii, pp. 373–374) recommends the\r\nimpregnation of body linen with a 30 per cent. solution of oleum betæ\r\nin 96 per cent. alcohol as an efficient method of keeping the body free\r\nof lice. But the process must be renewed each time the linen is washed\r\nand it takes fifteen minutes to carry out. On adding the oil to the\r\nalcohol, a portion of the former is precipitated, the supernatant fluid\r\nis decanted and poured over the linen, which is wrung out in it and\r\ndried. The garments retain their lice-proof properties until washed.\r\nThree days after wearing the clothes thus treated no lice remain on the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nPortnikov, _Proc. of Conference of Bacteriologists and Representatives\r\nof Medical Sanitary Authorities on the Campaign against Infectious\r\nDiseases in connection with the War, Soc. Russ. Physicians in mem.\r\nPirosov_, Moscow, 1915, p. 131.\r\n\r\n_Pediculus capitis_ and _Phthirus pubis_ are shown to be successfully\r\ncontrolled by applying spirit extract of sabadilla and both white and\r\ngrey mercury ointment, solution of corrosive sublimate of a strength\r\nof 1 in 250 to 1 in 100, amyl and ethyl alcohol, benzine, chloroform,\r\ncarbon tetrachloride, methane, birch tar, liquid of malinin, etc. The\r\ncontrol of _Pediculus vestimenti_ by the mixture of tartaric acid and\r\nsodium sulphite slightly moistened with water is advised. It is placed\r\nin small linen bags underneath the shirt; the heat of the body produces\r\na reaction which continues for two days, giving off a large amount of\r\nSO_{2}, which spreads beneath the shirt and kills all the parasites\r\nbut does not affect the skin. Marzinovsky, in the same _Proceedings_\r\n(pp. 56–68), gives a number of remedies for _Pediculus vestimenti_\r\n(called _humanus_), and mentions quinine or mercury, which latter\r\nthe natives in Turkestan carry on their hands and legs in bracelets\r\nsoaked in mercury compounds. He also mentions ethereal oils, the most\r\neffective being clove oil, eucalyptus, oil of anise and camphor. He\r\nrecommends for disinfecting clothing for army purposes the chamber\r\nused by the Japanese on a large scale. Kummerfelds’ wash is advised,\r\nand is prepared as follows: 20 parts of precipitated sulphur are\r\nincorporated in a mortar with 50 parts of glycerine; 2 parts of camphor\r\nare separately ground with 50 of eau-de-Cologne and 20 of borax, and\r\n870 parts of distilled water are added; the whole is mixed together and\r\n3 drops of an extract of musk are added; shake in order to prevent the\r\nsulphur settling down; 50 parts of ether are added to the mixture. This\r\nsounds an expensive and troublesome preparation to make.\r\n\r\nShipley A. E., “Flowers of Sulphur and Lice,” _Brit. Med. Journ._,\r\n1915, p. 295. It is here stated by Dr. Lounsbury that the South\r\nAfrican troops were supplied by the Government with bags of flowers\r\nof sulphur sewn in small calico bags and secured to the underclothing\r\nnext the skin as a preventive of lice.

The Protozoa that\r\ninfest man are very important, and the literature relating to them and\r\nto the treatment of the diseases that they produce is very extensive.\r\nAll that can be done in this Appendix is to give a very brief outline\r\nof some of the more recent and approved methods of treatment, for\r\nfurther details of which the reader should refer to standard medical\r\nworks, among which the following are noteworthy:--\r\n\r\nAllbutt and Rolleston (1907): “System of Medicine,” vol. ii, part 2,\r\n“Tropical Diseases and Animal Parasites,” London.\r\n\r\nCastellani and Chalmers (1913): “Manual of Tropical Medicine” (second\r\nedition), London.\r\n\r\nLaveran and Mesnil (1912): “Trypanosomes et Trypanosomiases” (second\r\nedition), Paris.\r\n\r\nManson (1914): “Tropical Diseases” (fifth edition), London.\r\n\r\nMense (1905): “Handbuch der Tropenkrankheiten,” Leipzig.\r\n\r\nRoss (1911): “The Prevention of Malaria,” London.\r\n\r\nScheube (1910): “Die Krankheiten der Warmen Länder,” Jena.\r\n\r\nReferences to the treatments tried in many parasitic diseases can be\r\nfound in the _Sleeping Sickness Bulletin_ and _Kala-azar Bulletin_,\r\nboth now superseded and greatly extended in scope in the _Tropical\r\nDiseases Bulletin_, published by the Tropical Diseases Bureau, Imperial\r\nInstitute, London, S.W.\r\n\r\nThe following diseases, due to protozoa and allied forms, are\r\ndiscussed:--\r\n\r\n  I.   Amœbic Dysentery.\r\n  II.  Trypanosomiases.\r\n  III. Flagellate Diarrhœa and Dysentery.\r\n  IV.  Leishmaniases--Kala-azar and Oriental Sore.\r\n  V.   Spirochætoses--Relapsing Fevers, Yaws, Syphilis and Bronchial.\r\n  VI.  Malaria.\r\n  VII. Balantidian or Ciliate Dysentery.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--AMŒBIC DYSENTERY.\r\n\r\nAmœbic dysentery, due to _Entamœba histolytica_ (see pp. 34–41), is\r\npresent throughout the tropical world and also occurs in temperate\r\nzones.\r\n\r\nWalker and Sellards[429] (1913) conducted important experiments\r\nwith amœbæ on prisoners in the Philippine Islands. They showed\r\nexperimentally that cultural amœbæ are non-pathogenic. As regards\r\nexperiments with _Entamœba coli_, after feeding to twenty individuals\r\nthey concluded that _E. coli_ is a parasite of the human intestine but\r\nnon-pathogenic and non-culturable. In a third series of experiments,\r\nafter feeding with motile _Entamœba histolytica_, tetragena cysts were\r\nfound in the stools later; when tetragena cysts were administered,\r\nmotile _E. histolytica_ were present in the subsequent stools. Some\r\nof the histolytica cases developed dysentery after a time. They lay\r\nstress on the necessity for the frequent examination of stools in order\r\nto detect carriers. The incubation period of entamœbic dysentery is\r\nusually long.\r\n\r\n[429] _Philippine Journ. Sc._, B, viii, p. 253.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the symptomatology of amœbic dysentery, Castellani and\r\nChalmers distinguish four types--the acute, chronic, latent, and mixed\r\ntypes.\r\n\r\nThe acute type has an abrupt onset; pain is felt in the lower part\r\nof the abdomen, and the motions, rarely exceeding thirty daily,\r\nare accompanied by much griping and straining. Blood and mucus are\r\npresent in the motions, and occasionally greyish material, consisting\r\nof leucocytes, mucus, Charcot-Leyden crystals, amœbæ, and bacteria,\r\nsometimes with particles of tissue. Nausea and vomiting may occur.\r\nDigestion is usually deranged. The abdomen is sunken, the liver and\r\nspleen are normal, but tenderness is felt along the course of the large\r\nintestine. The urine may be diminished in quantity.\r\n\r\nThe chronic type may succeed the acute, or appear like diarrhœa, the\r\nmotions being fæculent and containing mucus. Between exacerbations,\r\nconstipation may occur. The number of motions may only be twelve to\r\nfourteen per diem. Gangrenous complications may occur at any time, and\r\nchronic dysentery may persist for many years.\r\n\r\nThe latent type is important, as the patients, though free from\r\ndysenteric symptoms, harbour amœbæ and act as parasite carriers. The\r\nlatent condition may lead to acute attacks or to liver abscess.\r\n\r\nThe mixed type occurs where amœbic and bacillary dysentery are\r\ncombined. There is much fever, nausea, and vomiting. The motions are\r\nnumerous and often very offensive.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The most modern method of treatment, due to Leonard\r\nRogers, is by emetine. According to Castellani and Chalmers, it is\r\nwell to relieve griping and straining by either a hypodermic injection\r\nof morphia or by small enemata of 40 minims of laudanum in 1 oz. of\r\nmucilage of starch or by using 1/4 gr. morphia or 1/4 gr. codeine\r\nsuppository. A dose of castor oil (ʒiv to ʒvi) with or without a few\r\nminims of liquor opii sedativus or a few doses of saline may be given\r\nduring the first twenty-four hours. After the castor oil has acted or\r\nsimultaneously, emetine treatment should be commenced; 1/3 to 1/2 gr.\r\nof emetine hydrochloride, dissolved in sterile normal salt solution, is\r\ninjected hypodermically three times a day for two or three days.\r\n\r\nIf emetine cannot be obtained, 5 gr. doses of ipecacuanha every three\r\nto six hours in the form of membroids, or as pills coated with salol or\r\nkeratin, can be substituted.\r\n\r\nAfter acute symptoms have disappeared, intestinal irrigations once or\r\ntwice daily, on alternate days, are useful. A solution of tannic acid\r\n(3 to 5 per 1,000) or of quinine bihydrochloride varying in strength\r\nfrom 1 in 5,000 to 1 in 750 is very slowly injected in quantities of\r\n1/2 to 3 pints by means of a long, soft, rectal tube.\r\n\r\nFor gangrenous dysentery Castellani and Chalmers state that\r\nappendicostomy, with irrigation of the whole lower bowel with quinine\r\nlotion (1 in 1,000) or collargol (1 in 500), is the only chance.\r\n\r\nThe use of emetine should be continued in smaller doses after the\r\ndysenteric symptoms have ceased, in order to prevent relapses and as a\r\npossible safeguard against the development of a liver abscess.\r\n\r\nRecently (July, 1914), Dr. W. E. Deeks[430] has given an account of\r\nhis successful procedure in dealing with the dysenteries in the Ancon\r\nHospital, Panama Canal Zone, of which medical clinic he is the chief.\r\nWith regard to amœbic dysentery he advocates: (1) Rest, to increase the\r\npatient’s resistance; (2) a generous milk diet, which is practically\r\nall absorbed before it reaches the large bowel; (3) saline or plain\r\nwater irrigations, one to three daily; (4) the administration of\r\nbismuth sub-nitrate in heroic doses; 180 gr. is given mechanically\r\nsuspended in about a tumbler of plain or effervescent water every three\r\nhours, day and night in severe cases, only lessening the amount when\r\nimprovement takes place. Mechanical suspension in a large quantity of\r\nwater is essential. When the stools begin to decrease in number and the\r\ntongue becomes clean, the number of doses is reduced to three or four\r\ndaily. In very chronic cases one or two doses daily for a month after\r\nconvalescence are recommended.\r\n\r\n[430] _Annals Trop. Med. and Parasitol._, viii, pp. 321, 353.\r\n\r\nIn exceptional cases of extreme emaciation and exhaustion, showing\r\nmarked toxic symptoms, surgical treatment is necessary, and at Ancon a\r\nwide, open cæcostomy is performed.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of dysentery with bismuth sub-nitrate has been in use\r\nfor some years at Ancon. Latterly, a combined treatment by hypodermic\r\ninjections of emetine and bismuth sub-nitrate by the mouth has been\r\nused, and the authorities there consider that it is better to combine\r\nthe two drugs rather than use each singly. Emetine probably acts as\r\na direct poison to the amœbæ, while the bismuth probably acts by\r\ndestroying the symbiotic organisms necessary for their growth.\r\n\r\nWith regard to preventive measures, all drinking water should be\r\nfiltered and boiled, and uncooked vegetables and salads avoided.\r\nScrupulous care with regard to personal cleanliness, and avoidance of\r\ntouching the mouth or lips after contact with dysenteric patients, are\r\nessential. Isolation of parasite carriers is of great use in combating\r\nand controlling outbreaks of amœbic dysentery. The pollution of soil\r\nand water must be rigorously prevented.\r\n\r\nLiver abscess due to amœbæ must be localized by exploratory\r\npunctures, and then opened and drained. Intramuscular injections of\r\nemetine hydrochloride, 1/6 gr. to 1/2 gr. every day, will reduce the\r\ntemperature and afford relief.\r\n\r\nOral endamœbiasis has been recently investigated by Bass and Johns,\r\nSmith and Barrett and colleagues (see pp. 43, 733). It responds\r\nto treatment with emetine, and 1/2 gr. of emetine hydrochloride\r\nadministered hypodermically each day is of service. Rinsing the mouth\r\nwith a solution of fluid extract of ipecacuanha is also useful.\r\n\r\nRogers[431] (1915) recommends a combined treatment of emetine and\r\nstreptococcal vaccines for pyorrhœa alveolaris.\r\n\r\n[431] _Ind. Med. Gazette_, April, 1915, l, p. 121.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--TRYPANOSOMIASES.\r\n\r\nThe human trypanosomiases are those occurring in Africa, due to\r\n_Trypanosoma gambiense_ and _T. rhodesiense_ and spread by Glossinæ,\r\nand that due to _T. cruzi_, occurring in South America and spread\r\nby the Reduviid bugs, _Triatoma_ spp. These trypanosomiases present\r\ndifferent clinical features and are best dealt with separately.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfrican Sleeping Sickness.\r\n\r\nSleeping sickness, due to _Trypanosoma gambiense_ or varieties thereof,\r\nwas first reported from West Africa and is now present, not only along\r\nthe West Coast and in Nigeria, but throughout the Congo basin into\r\nUganda, north of which it exists in the Bahr-el-Ghazal province of\r\nthe Sudan. In Nyasaland and Rhodesia a more virulent but less widely\r\ndistributed disease is produced by _Trypanosoma rhodesiense_.\r\n\r\nThere is a general similarity between the two diseases, and the\r\nsymptoms as described by the leading authorities agree in the main. The\r\nmalady due to _T. rhodesiense_ has been known only since 1910 and the\r\ndifferences between the malady due to it and to _T. gambiense_ will be\r\nindicated.\r\n\r\nThe course of the disease may be roughly divided into three stages, the\r\nincubation, the febrile or glandular, and the cerebral stage.\r\n\r\nThe exact incubation period is not known with certainty in man.\r\nProbably, in most cases, it does not exceed two to three weeks, but\r\ndisease signs may not appear for months. The bite of the Glossina gives\r\nrise to local irritation, which may be overlooked. The irritation\r\nusually subsides in the course of a few days.\r\n\r\nThe febrile, or glandular stage, is marked by attacks of fever of\r\nan intermittent type. An erythematous eruption is often found on\r\nEuropeans. This rash begins as irregularly shaped pinkish patches which\r\nclear in the centre until a ring is produced. It may occur on any part\r\nof the body but is more frequent on the trunk. A typical symptom is the\r\nenlargement of one or more of the lymphatic glands, especially those\r\nof the neck. A general, deep hyperæsthesia, known as Kerandel’s sign,\r\nmay be present, and if the patient strikes a limb against any hard\r\nobject, a feeling of acute pain is felt, the sensation being slightly\r\ndelayed. As repeated attacks of fever increase, the patient may become\r\nanæmic. The febrile stage may last for years, and cure may be brought\r\nabout at this phase, but frequently, after the febrile stage has\r\nlasted some time, the cerebral stage is reached. Tachycardia is also\r\na symptom. Auto-agglutination of the red blood corpuscles is another\r\nuseful characteristic, as it is said to occur rarely in other tropical\r\ndiseases, but some workers doubt its value.\r\n\r\nThe cerebral, or true sleeping sickness stage is marked by a great\r\nchange in the habits of the victim, who becomes apathetic and dull,\r\ncareless and dirty in habits, and begins to experience difficulty in\r\nwalking. Tremors of varying degrees of severity are common and the\r\ngait is peculiar. There is usually fever with rise of temperature from\r\n100° F. to 104° F. in the evening, becoming subnormal in the morning.\r\nFor some days before death, it often becomes permanently subnormal.\r\nCongestion and œdema of the lungs, with patches of pneumonia, are not\r\ninfrequently observed before death. The torpor gradually deepens, and\r\nthe patient loses flesh. Frequently the lips swell and saliva dribbles.\r\nThe patient usually becomes comatose and death ensues. Mania and\r\ndelusions, and psychical and physical symptoms resembling those found\r\nin general paralysis of the insane, sometimes occur, and death may\r\narise from secondary complications such as pneumonia or dysentery.\r\n\r\nPathologically, the disease seems to consist of a chronic inflammation\r\nof the lymphatic system. The trypanosomes reach the lymphatic glands\r\nwhich become inflamed, and gradually invade the blood and the\r\ncerebrospinal fluid. Sooner or later, as a result of the lymphatic\r\ndisease, changes occur in the membranes and substances of the brain\r\nand spinal cord. There is round-celled perivascular infiltration of\r\nthe pia-arachnoid of the brain and spinal cord. These changes cause\r\ncompression of the blood-vessels, and so lessen the supply of blood to\r\nthe brain and spinal cord. Further changes in the latter organs result\r\nin the production of the symptoms that have given the disease the name\r\nof “sleeping sickness.”\r\n\r\nThe disease due to _Trypanosoma rhodesiense_ generally runs a more\r\nrapid course than that due to _T. gambiense_. The torpor and sleepiness\r\nmay not be obvious or be very slight, and the enlargement of the\r\nlymphatic glands of the neck also may not be marked or may appear to be\r\nabsent. The duration of the disease often appears to be from three to\r\nsix months.\r\n\r\nTreatment is only of use if commenced in the earlier stages of the\r\ndisease. The substances of most value so far are arsenic in the form of\r\natoxyl (introduced by Wolferstan Thomas in 1905) and antimony in the\r\nform of tartar emetic. Castellani and Chalmers and Manson recommend\r\ntreatment by combining the use of both substances. The combined\r\ntreatment is recommended not only because both substances have been\r\nproved of service independently, but also because certain strains of\r\ntrypanosomes resistant to arsenic are known, and trypanosomes can\r\ndevelop a resistance to arsenic. Such forms, that would not be affected\r\nby the atoxyl, are left open to attack by the antimony salt. Daniels\r\nalso recommends combined arsenic and antimony treatment, and (1915)\r\nuses atoxyl and antiluetin.\r\n\r\nAtoxyl is best given intramuscularly in 10 per cent. solution in\r\nsterile normal saline solution. Galyl is also said to have given good\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nCastellani and Chalmers recommend: (1) Manson’s method of\r\nadministration of atoxyl, viz., 2 to 3 gr. of atoxyl are given by\r\nintramuscular injection every third day for at least two years; or\r\n(2) Broden and Rodhain’s method, 7-1/2 gr. of atoxyl by intramuscular\r\ninjection every fifth day. For the combined therapy by atoxyl and\r\nantimony they recommend the following:--“An atoxyl injection (3 gr.) is\r\ngiven every third day or 7-1/2 gr. every fifth day, and sodiotartrate\r\nof antimony (Plimmer’s salt) is administered daily, 2 gr. dissolved\r\nin a large quantity of water (2 pints) by the mouth or by the rectum.\r\nTartar emetic, however, is best given by intravenous injections, using\r\nsolutions of 1 in 100 or 1 in 1,000. The dose of the drug to be given\r\nis 5 to 10 cg. per injection. It is important that none of the fluid of\r\nthe injection should escape into the surrounding tissues, as a violent\r\ninflammation may result. These injections should be administered\r\nmonthly on ten consecutive days for a long period.”\r\n\r\nMacfie and Gallagher (1914) injected 6 gr. of atoxyl intramuscularly\r\nevery week in cases infected with _T. nigeriense_ in the Eket district\r\nof Southern Nigeria.\r\n\r\nLarge doses of atoxyl were often said to cause distressing results\r\nsuch as optic atrophy, and when the onset of such occurred the\r\ndrug was usually discontinued. However, Daniels[432] (July, 1915)\r\npoints out that eye troubles, such as iridocyclitis, are symptoms of\r\ntrypanosomiasis.\r\n\r\n[432] _Journ. Trop. Med. and Hyg._, xviii, p. 157.\r\n\r\nOther arsenical preparations such as soamin and arsenophenylglycin have\r\nbeen used, but less successfully than atoxyl. Fowler’s solution, well\r\ndiluted, has been given by the mouth when treatment by injection was\r\nnot possible, the doses commencing with 5 minims and increasing to 15\r\nminims.\r\n\r\nSalvarsan and neo-salvarsan have also been tried for sleeping sickness.\r\nPlimmer recommended powdered antimony suspended in sterile olive oil.\r\nRanken used precipitated metallic antimony in normal saline solution\r\ninjected intravenously.\r\n\r\nLaveran and Thiroux have recommended a combined treatment of atoxyl and\r\nan inorganic salt of arsenic such as orpiment. The orpiment is given as\r\npills, in doses of 2 gr. of orpiment two or three times daily. Opium is\r\nadded to the orpiment to prevent diarrhœa. This treatment is said to\r\nhave been used in man with good results.\r\n\r\n_Trypanosoma rhodesiense_ seems less amenable to treatment than _T.\r\ngambiense_.\r\n\r\nThe main preventive measures seem to lie in segregation of the sick in\r\nareas not infested with Glossinæ, and in measures against these flies,\r\nsuch as bush clearing and destruction, to some extent, of _proved_\r\nreservoirs in big game.\r\n\r\n\r\nSouth American Trypanosomiasis.\r\n\r\nThe chief clinical features of the trypanosomiasis occurring in Brazil\r\nhave already been indicated (see p. 87). With regard to treatment,\r\naccording to Castellani and Chalmers the indications are the same\r\nas those for African trypanosomiasis, together with treatment for\r\nhypothyroidism. Preventive measures are directed against the Reduviid\r\nbug, _Triatoma megista_, that transmits the disease. The bugs occur in\r\nnumbers in the cracks of the houses of the poor of Minas Geraes, and\r\nmay be destroyed by sulphur fumigation, lime-washing or whitewashing.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--FLAGELLATE DIARRHŒA AND DYSENTERY.\r\n\r\nThe chief causal agents are _Trichomonas hominis_ (_T. intestinalis_),\r\n_Chilomastix_ (_Tetramitus_) _mesnili_ and allied organisms (see pp. 54\r\nto 57), and _Lamblia intestinalis_ (see pp. 57 to 60 and Appendix\r\npp. 734 to 736).\r\n\r\nThese parasites and the associated diarrhœas occur in temperate as\r\nwell as in warm climates. Probably some of the diarrhœas in India are\r\nthus caused. The same, or similar parasites occur in various Muridæ,\r\nespecially rats and mice, which may act as reservoirs.\r\n\r\n(i) Mello-Leitao[433] (1913), writing from Rio de Janeiro, states\r\nthat there is a primary flagellate dysentery, due to _Trichomonas\r\nintestinal_is (Leuckart) and to _Lamblia intestinalis_ (_Lambl_),\r\neither separately or in combination. He considers it a benign disease,\r\nand the most frequent form of dysentery in young children. Trichomonas\r\nand Lamblia were found to be pathogenic to children under 3 years of\r\nage.\r\n\r\n[433] _Brit. Journ. Children’s Diseases_, x, p. 60.\r\n\r\nEscomel[434] (1913) collected 152 cases of dysentery in Peru due solely\r\nto Trichomonas. Examination of the reservoirs containing the water used\r\nfor drinking purposes showed the presence of Trichomonas. After the\r\nreservoirs were cleaned no more Trichomonas was found and the cases of\r\ndysentery ceased.\r\n\r\n[434] _Bull. Soc. Path. Exot._, vi, p. 120.\r\n\r\nBrumpt[435] (1912) described a colitis due to _Trichomonas\r\nintestinalis_ in a patient returned from Tonkin.\r\n\r\n[435] _Ibid._, v, p. 725.\r\n\r\nCases of infection by _Chilomastix_ (_Tetramitus_) _mesnili_, with\r\ncolitis or dysenteric symptoms, are recorded by Brumpt (1912) from\r\nFrance, and by Nattan-Larrier[436] (1912) from the Ivory Coast\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n[436] _Ibid._, v, p. 495.\r\n\r\nMarques da Cunha and Torres[437] (1914) describe five cases of chronic\r\ndiarrhœa in Brazilian children due to the _Chilomastix_ (_Tetramitus_).\r\n\r\n[437] _Brazil Medico_, xxviii, p. 269.\r\n\r\nGäbel[438] (1914) described a case of seasonal diarrhœa contracted\r\nin Tunis and caused by a Tetramitid parasite which he named _Difämus\r\ntunensis_, as the discoverer considered that it lacked an undulating\r\nmembrane in its large cytostome.\r\n\r\n[438] _Arch. f. Protistenkunde_, xxxiv, p. 1.\r\n\r\nDerrieu and Raynaud[439] (1914) record a case of chronic dysentery in\r\nAlgeria due to a Trichomonad possessing an undulating membrane and\r\nfive free flagella. The parasite was named _Hexamastix ardindelteili_,\r\nbut the generic name _Hexamastix_ is pre-occupied. Chatterjee’s\r\n_Pentatrichomonas bengalensis_ (1915) is possibly the same organism.\r\n\r\n[439] _Bull. Soc. Path. Exot._, vii, p. 571.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Escomel (1913), finding ipecacuanha and calomel useless,\r\nrecommends turpentine for Trichomonad dysentery. Two to 4 gr of essence\r\nof turpentine in an emulsion are given by the mouth, and enemata\r\ncontaining 15 to 20 drops of turpentine emulsified in the yolk of an\r\negg to which is added a little water and tincture of opium. Derrieu and\r\nRaynaud found this treatment effective in Algeria. Smithies[440] (1912)\r\nreports two cures of cases of severe dyspepsia, in which Trichomonads\r\nwere found in the stomach contents, after administration of a single\r\ndose of 50 to 60 gr. of thymol, given at bed-time, together with 2 gr.\r\nof calomel, and followed by an ounce of Carlsbad salts in the morning.\r\nThe patients came from the Southern United States, and had been in the\r\nhabit of drinking unfiltered surface water in the localities in which\r\nthey lived. Mello-Leitao[441] used magnesium sulphate and water or milk\r\ndiet. Sometimes enemata of collargol (1 per cent.) or electrargol were\r\nrequired. Rosenfeld recommended calomel. Methylene blue has also been\r\ntried. Recently, Escomel[442] (1914) recommends enemata of an aqueous\r\nsolution of iodine (1 per 1,000) and farinaceous diet. Lynch[443]\r\n(1915), working in South Carolina, recommends a mouth wash of saturated\r\nsolution of bicarbonate of soda three times daily in oral infections. A\r\nsimilar solution was used as a douche in vaginal trichomoniasis.\r\n\r\n[440] _Amer. Journ. Med. Sci._, cxliv, p. 82.\r\n\r\n[441] _Brit. Journ. Children’s Diseases_, x, p. 60.\r\n\r\n[442] _Bull. Soc. Path. Exot._, vii, p. 657.\r\n\r\n[443] _Amer. Journ. Trop. Dis. and Prevent. Med._, ii, p. 627.\r\n\r\nStiles (1913) points out that when amœbæ or flagellates are found in a\r\nlarge percentage (10 to 40, or even 60) of the members of a community,\r\nmeans should be taken to improve the methods for the disposal of the\r\ndejecta, so that the food supply may be carefully protected against\r\nfæcal contamination. Cysts of the parasites may be air-borne or\r\nconveyed to food on the bodies of house-flies.\r\n\r\n(ii) _Lamblia intestinalis_ in man may cause diarrhœa with\r\ndysenteriform stools. The diarrhœa may be of a chronic recurrent\r\ncharacter. The flagellate, or a variety of it, is fairly common in the\r\ndigestive tract of rats and mice.\r\n\r\nMathis[444] (1914) gives an interesting account of cases in Tonkin. In\r\na child, aged 3, the stools were at first glairy and blood-stained,\r\ncontaining many encysted Lamblia. The child’s home was infested with\r\nmice. In another case, the house of the patient harboured numerous rats.\r\n\r\n[444] _Bull. Soc. Med. Chirurg. Indo-Chine_, v, p. 55.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mathis, prognosis is favourable, but emetine hydrochloride\r\nis without action on Lamblia. Prowazek and Werner[445] (1914), however,\r\nstate that emetine will act upon the flagellates, but not upon the\r\ncysts. They recommend uzara (two tablets, three times daily) and\r\nextract of male fern as useful in certain cases. Martin Mayer (1914)\r\nfound emetine hydrochloride successful in a case in the Hamburg\r\nSeamen’s Hospital, but Assmy (1914) points out that a suitable diet and\r\ndaily doses of magnesium sulphate are sufficient, in his experience, to\r\neffect an improvement, and he doubts the specific action of emetine.\r\nEscomel (1914) recommends milk diet, then calomel succeeded by castor\r\noil.\r\n\r\n[445] Beihefte z. _Arch. f. Schiffs- u. Tropen-Hyg._, xviii, 5, p. 155.\r\n\r\nAccording to Noc, Lamblia may also be water-borne. Healthy carriers of\r\nLamblia cysts are known. Food should be protected from being soiled by\r\nrats and mice.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--LEISHMANIASES.\r\n\r\nA. *Kala-azar.*\r\n\r\n(i) _“Indian” Kala-azar due to_ Leishmania donovani.\r\n\r\nIndian kala-azar due to _Leishmania donovani_ is a very fatal disease\r\nwith a rate of mortality varying from 70 to 98 per cent. of the cases.\r\n\r\nThe incubation period is very variable and the early symptoms not\r\nwell defined. The incubation period seems to range from three weeks\r\nto several months after exposure to infection. The onset seems to\r\ncommence with a rigor and attack of irregular, remittent fever, which\r\nmay show two remissions per day in a four-hourly temperature chart.\r\nRogers considers the daily double remission almost diagnostic. The\r\nduration of this first attack is from two to six weeks. The spleen\r\nand liver enlarge, especially the former, and are painful and tender.\r\nTowards the end of the time the temperature declines and the first\r\nperiod of the disease ends. After this period an apyrexial interval\r\noccurs, which, after some weeks, ends in an attack of fever resembling\r\nthe first. Periods of pyrexia and apyrexia alternate. Anæmia commences\r\nand asthenia appears and deepens steadily. The patient is now thin\r\nand wasted, the abdomen much swollen and protuberant, the ribs show\r\nclearly, the limbs are wasted and skin and tongue darker than normal.\r\nIn Europeans the skin is of a remarkable earthy hue, and in natives of\r\nIndia darker than normal, approaching black. Intestinal disturbances,\r\noften in the form of very obstinate and intractable diarrhœa or\r\ndysenteric attacks, are common. Papular eruptions often appear,\r\nparticularly on the thighs; hæmorrhages also may occur. The disease\r\nlasts for periods varying from seven months to two years, and usually\r\nends fatally.\r\n\r\nTreatment, unfortunately, has not been very successful up to 1915.\r\nManson has reported two cases of cure by intramuscular injections of\r\natoxyl daily or every other day in doses of 3 gr. Rogers has advocated\r\nlarge doses of quinine, 60 to 90 gr. daily until the temperature falls\r\nand then 20 gr. daily. Castellani and Chalmers consider the best\r\nresults are obtained by large doses of quinine given intramuscularly,\r\nsupplemented by a course of quinine cacodylate injections or atoxyl\r\ninjections. Tartar emetic should be tried (see pp. 627, 629),\r\nespecially as L. Rogers (July, 1915) has had promising results in ten\r\ncases. Castellani (1914) and Mackie (1915), have also had successful\r\nresults. Leishman states that the administration of red bone-marrow,\r\neither raw or in the form of tablets, may be beneficial. Good nursing\r\nand careful diet are essential, and diarrhœa or dysentery must receive\r\nthe appropriate treatment.\r\n\r\nWith regard to preventive measures, the extermination of bugs and\r\nother biting insects seems to be of most service. Domestic and personal\r\ncleanliness is of great importance. Patients should be segregated. It\r\nwould probably be as well if houses in which many cases of kala-azar\r\noccurred were destroyed. Dodds Price, in Assam tea gardens, moves the\r\ncoolie lines 300 to 800 yards from old infected ones, with satisfactory\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n\r\n(ii) _Infantile Kala-azar due to_ Leishmania infantum.\r\n\r\nThis malady is found among children, rarely in adults, along the\r\nMediterranean littoral.\r\n\r\nThe disease commences insidiously and is often unrecognized until some\r\nintestinal disturbance occurs. The spleen is then found to be somewhat\r\nenlarged, and the case has often been regarded as one of malaria.\r\nThe child becomes anæmic, suffers from diarrhœa, alternating with\r\nconstipation, and has attacks of irregular fever. The spleen continues\r\nto enlarge and protrudes from under the cover of the ribs. Hæmorrhages\r\nfrom the nose and gums and into the skin occur. Anæmia and wasting set\r\nin. The abdomen then becomes very enlarged. The child becomes much less\r\nactive both physically and mentally, and looks prematurely old. Death\r\noften occurs from exhaustion, though some cases of spontaneous recovery\r\nare known.\r\n\r\nTreatment up till recently has been unsatisfactory. Some of the\r\nremedies tried, as quoted by Castellani and Chalmers, are 15 cg. doses\r\nof atoxyl, benzoate of mercury (2 to 4 mg. as a daily injection),\r\nthiarsol (5 to 15 mg. by subcutaneous injection), salvarsan, etc.\r\nRecently Cristina and Caronia (1915)[446] have given repeated\r\nintravenous injections of 1 per cent. aqueous solution of tartar\r\nemetic, the dose varying from 2 to 10 cg. The treatment in various\r\ncases has lasted from 15 to 40 days.\r\n\r\n[446] _Bull. Soc. Path. Exot._, viii, p. 63.\r\n\r\nProphylactic measures seem to lie in the destruction of infected dogs\r\nand diminishing the breeding of fleas (see p. 111).\r\n\r\n\r\nB. *Oriental Sore, due to Leishmania tropica.*\r\n\r\nOriental sore, known under many other names (see p. 107), is a local\r\ninfection of the skin due to _Leishmania tropica_. The incubation\r\nperiod varies from a few days to some weeks, or even months, and\r\nthen one or several small itching papules appear. Each spot becomes\r\nred and shotty, the papules increase slowly in size and the surface\r\nbecomes covered with papery scales. After a variable time, usually\r\nnot exceeding three to four months, ulceration occurs and a yellowish\r\nsecretion is exuded that soon dries into a scab. Under the scab\r\nulceration continues by erosion of the edges, and subsidiary sores\r\narise around the parent ulcer and usually fuse with it. Healing\r\ncommences after six to twelve months. Granulation begins at the centre\r\nand spreads outwards, and when healing is complete, a depressed,\r\nwhitish or pinkish scar remains.\r\n\r\nMany treatments for Oriental sore have been devised but do not seem\r\nparticularly satisfactory. Castellani and Chalmers state that the\r\nscabs should be removed by boracic acid fomentations, and the ulcers\r\nthoroughly disinfected once or twice daily with a 1 per 1,000 solution\r\nof perchloride of mercury, after which an ordinary antiseptic ointment\r\nis applied.\r\n\r\nThe use of permanganate of potash has been advocated both by French\r\nand English doctors. Both large and small sores can be treated.\r\nThe patient’s skin around the sore is protected by a thick layer\r\nof vaseline, and the surface of the ulcer powdered with potassium\r\npermanganate, which is kept in position by a pad of gauze and a\r\nbandage. The treatment is said to cause great pain for six to eight\r\nhours, but at the most, three treatments are necessary before the sore\r\nbecomes a simple ulcer, well on the way to healing. The permanganate\r\nmay also be used in ointment. Excision of the ulcer when small is\r\nadvisable when the site of the ulcer permits of this. According to\r\nManson, reports on treatment by radium, salvarsan and carbon dioxide\r\nsnow are decidedly promising. Mitchell (1914)[447] reports favourably\r\non the use of carbon dioxide snow in the form of a pencil, in India.\r\nIn Brazil several workers (1914) record successful results from the\r\nintravenous injection of a 1 per cent. solution of tartar emetic in\r\ndistilled water. Low (1915) has successfully treated a case by direct\r\nlocal application of tartar emetic. Row (1912) has treated cases of\r\nOriental sore by inoculation of killed cultures of the causal organism.\r\n\r\n[447] _Journ. Roy. Army Med. Corps_, xxiii, pp. 440–446 (see _Trop.\r\nDis. Bull._, v, No. 5, p. 276).\r\n\r\nAs the disease is very contagious, the slightest wound, and any insect\r\nbite, should be thoroughly disinfected with 5 per cent. carbolic acid\r\nor iodine. Destruction of bugs, lice, and other biting insects should\r\nbe enforced. As dogs may contract the disease (see p. 108), it is well\r\nnot to allow them in the house and not to encourage undue contact with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Naso-oral Leishmaniasis_ (_Espundia_) _due to_ Leishmania tropica.\r\n\r\nThis form of Leishmaniasis has been reported from South America and\r\nrecently by Christopherson[448] (1914) from the Sudan. In South America\r\nit is often called Espundia, also Buba and Forestal Leishmaniasis. The\r\nprimary lesion is found usually on the forearms, legs, chest or trunk.\r\nThis ulcer is of the Oriental sore type, and after some months, or\r\neven as long as two years, heals up, leaving a thick scar. While the\r\nulcer is open, or more often after it has healed, lesions appear on the\r\nmucosa of the mouth and nose. The hard and soft palate, gums and lips\r\nall may be attacked. The mucosa of the nose is usually attacked and the\r\ncartilages become destroyed, producing great deformity. In bad cases\r\nthe pharynx and larynx may become infected.\r\n\r\n[448] _Annals Trop. Med. and Parasitol._, viii, p. 485.\r\n\r\nTill recently it was believed that treatment was of little use unless\r\nthe case could be investigated early. Escomel considered that if the\r\nprimary cutaneous lesion was excised or destroyed, further progress of\r\nthe disease was prevented. When lesions have appeared on the mucosa of\r\nthe mouth or nose, little could be done. The ulcers might be cauterized\r\nand mild antiseptic mouth washes used.\r\n\r\nIn 1913 Vianna, working in Brazil, introduced treatment by tartar\r\nemetic, which is now becoming more widely known and proving\r\nefficacious. Carini[449] (1914) applies it thus. Tartar emetic (that\r\nis, potassium antimonyl tartrate) in 1 per cent. aqueous solution is\r\nintroduced slowly into a vein, such as the vein at the bend of the\r\nelbow, in doses of 5 to 10 c.c. daily or on alternate days according to\r\nthe tolerance of the patient to the drug. Eighteen to forty injections\r\nhave been used. In some of the memoirs on the subject, the drug is\r\nreferred to as antimony tartrate.\r\n\r\n[449] _Bull. Soc. Path. Exot._, vii, p. 277.\r\n\r\nThe course of the disease is chronic and may last for twenty to thirty\r\nyears, death usually resulting from some intercurrent disease.\r\n\r\nAt present the actual transmitter of Espundia is not known with\r\ncertainty. Various sand-flies (Simulidæ) have been suspected of\r\ntransmitting the disease, though so far proof is wanting. It has also\r\nbeen suggested that the natural food sources of some Simulidæ known to\r\nbite man, namely, certain snakes[450] and lizards,[451] are possible\r\nreservoirs of the disease.\r\n\r\n[450] Lindsay (1914), _Trans. Soc. Trop. Med. and Hyg._, vii, p. 259.\r\n\r\n[451] Sergent (Ed. and Et.), Lemaire and Senevet (1914), _Bull. Soc.\r\nPath. Exot._, vii, p. 577.\r\n\r\nProphylactic measures would seem to consist in the immediate\r\ndisinfection of insect bites by tincture of iodine, and by avoidance of\r\nareas known to be infested with snakes and lizards, and insects that\r\nprey on them and man indifferently. The destruction of the primary\r\nlesion as soon as detected is essential, and the isolation of advanced\r\ncases of the disease seems advisable.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--SPIROCHÆTOSES.\r\n\r\nA. *Relapsing Fevers.*\r\n\r\nThe relapsing fevers of Europe and of America, due to _Spirochæta\r\nrecurrentis_ and _S. novyi_ (probably a race of _S. recurrentis_),\r\npresent much the same symptoms, which differ in some respects from\r\nthose due to _S. duttoni_, the excitant of “tick” or “relapsing” fever\r\nin Africa (see pp. 116–122).\r\n\r\nThe incubation period of _S. recurrentis_ varies from two to twelve\r\ndays, during which time a very slight indisposition may be noticed. The\r\nonset is usually sudden, with severe headache, pains in the back, limbs\r\nand stomach and a feeling of weakness. There is a rise of temperature\r\nto 103° F. or 104° F., and the temperature continues high till about\r\nthe sixth or seventh day. The skin is yellowish, hot and damp; a rash,\r\ndisappearing on pressure, may occur on the trunk and legs, nausea is\r\nalways present and thirst is usual. The liver and spleen both enlarge.\r\nThe number of respirations and pulse-rate become increased. On the\r\nsixth or seventh day a crisis occurs. There is violent perspiration,\r\nwith a rapid fall of temperature, pulse and respiration become normal\r\nand the patient sleeps and awakes better. Improvement continues for\r\nsome days, and recovery may ensue, but usually about the fourteenth day\r\nrelapse occurs, lasting usually three or four days. A second relapse\r\nis unusual. Numerous complications are known, _e.g._, bronchitis,\r\npneumonia, diarrhœa and dysentery.\r\n\r\nWith regard to treatment, the specific appears to be salvarsan.\r\nCastellani and Chalmers recommend salvarsan administered intravenously.\r\nIntramuscular inoculations (for example, into the buttock) of a\r\nsuspension of “606” in oil can also be given. The drug is very\r\nefficacious, but large doses should not be given. An intravenous\r\ninjection of 4 or 5 gr. does not give rise to unpleasant symptoms but\r\nis sufficient to effect a cure.\r\n\r\nThe incubation period for the American form of the disease is at least\r\nfive to seven days, and the first attack lasts about five to six days.\r\nThe treatment is by salvarsan as detailed previously.\r\n\r\nAs relapsing fever is spread by body lice and possibly by bugs,\r\npreventive measures are directed against these insects. Strict\r\ncleanliness of person, clothing, bedding and dwellings is essential.\r\nFurniture, _e.g._, wooden bedsteads, liable to harbour such insects\r\nshould not be used.\r\n\r\nThe principal and best-known relapsing fever of Africa is that excited\r\nby _Spirochæta duttoni_, and transmitted to man by ticks, chiefly\r\n_Ornithodorus moubata_. The incubation period is usually about seven\r\ndays but may be longer. The patient is dull and lethargic, perspires\r\nfreely and is often constipated. The temperature rises to 103° F.\r\nor 105° F., there is headache, pains in the back and limbs, general\r\nchilliness and great pain in the region of the spleen, which often\r\nenlarges. The symptoms become worse, there is a fall of temperature\r\nwith improvement in the morning, and a rise, with increase of pain,\r\nin the evening. Spirochætes are now found in the blood in greater\r\nnumbers. The symptoms last three to four days and end in a crisis with\r\nprofuse sweating and fall of temperature below normal. The day before\r\nthe crisis there is a pseudo-crisis, when the temperature falls but\r\nthere is no improvement. The patient is left weak and tired. Recovery\r\nmay follow, but more usually a relapse occurs. The intermission period\r\nvaries; five to eight days is common. The symptoms of the relapses are\r\nlike those of the first attack. The number of relapses varies, five to\r\neleven may occur.\r\n\r\nThe treatment recommended is by salvarsan, as for the European\r\nrelapsing fever.\r\n\r\nWith regard to prophylaxis, localities where ticks abound must be\r\navoided and the parasites themselves destroyed. Native huts should be\r\navoided. Mosquito nets, a bed well off the ground and the use of night\r\nlights are advised by Manson to avoid attacks by ticks, which are often\r\nnocturnal in their habits.\r\n\r\nIn North Africa (Algeria, Tunis, Tripoli, Egypt), and sometimes in\r\nthe Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, a spirochætosis due to _S. berbera_ occurs.\r\nAccording to Castellani and Chalmers, the incubation period varies\r\nsomewhat. The fever reaches its height during the first twenty-four\r\nhours, and afterwards shows a morning remission. Jaundice is often\r\nabsent, but there may be hepatic tenderness and splenic enlargement.\r\nOne or two relapses usually occur. The treatment is on the same\r\nlines as for the other spirochætal fevers. Sergent and Gillot[452]\r\n(1911), working at the Institut Pasteur of Algeria, have had good\r\nresults by using injections of salvarsan in doses of 0·75 to 1·0 cg.\r\nper kilogramme weight of the patient. The prophylactic measures are\r\ndirected against lice and other biting insects. Personal cleanliness is\r\nmost necessary.\r\n\r\n[452] _Bull. Soc. Path. Exot._, iv, p. 440.\r\n\r\nIn Asia, a relapsing fever, due to the spirochæte named _S. carteri_ by\r\nManson in 1907, producing a mortality of about 18 per cent., occurs.\r\nThe symptoms have a general resemblance to those produced by _S.\r\nrecurrentis_, but on the fall of temperature to subnormal on the sixth\r\nor seventh day, when profuse perspiration and polyuria occur, instead\r\nof improvement following, the patient often becomes collapsed, with a\r\nclammy skin and feeble pulse. Improvement is slow. The first relapse\r\noccurs about the fourteenth day of the attack, when the temperature may\r\nbe higher than for the first attack. There are seldom more than four\r\nrelapses. The treatment is by salvarsan, of which doses of not more\r\nthan 5 gr. intravenously should be given. Sudden heart failure being\r\ncommon, Castellani and Chalmers state that cardiac stimulants should be\r\ngiven. Prophylaxis is the same as for European relapsing fever.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. *Yaws or Frambœsia tropica.*\r\n\r\nYaws is essentially a tropical disease, though it is found in the\r\ntropical and subtropical zones in all parts of the world, except\r\nin the mountains and cold districts. In 1905, Castellani found the\r\ncausal organism, _Treponema pertenue_ (sometimes called _Spirochæta\r\npertennis_) (see p. 127). The disease shows three periods: (1) The\r\nprimary stage, consisting of the development of the primary lesion or\r\npapule, which is usually extragenital. The papule dries into a crust\r\nbeneath which an ulcer lies. (2) The secondary or granulomatous stage,\r\nwhich commences from one to three months after the primary lesion is\r\nfirst seen. It consists of a general eruption of small papules, some of\r\nwhich enlarge and become granulomatous nodules covered with a yellowish\r\ncrust. They are common on the limbs and face. (3) The tertiary stage,\r\nin which deep ulcerations and gummatous nodules appear. Any of the\r\ntissues may be involved. Osseous lesions may occur. The disease does\r\nnot appear to be hereditary; it is usually spread by contact.\r\n\r\nThe best treatment appears to be by salvarsan or neo-salvarsan.\r\nCastellani and Chalmers recommend intramuscular and intravenous\r\ninjections. For intramuscular injection an alkaline or neutral solution\r\nof the drug is preferable, or a suspension of the drug in oil may be\r\nused. The dose varies from 0·3 to 0·5 gr according to the age and sex\r\nof the patient. For use intravenously, a slightly smaller dose is\r\nrequired. Galyl is also being used.\r\n\r\nIn countries where frambœsia is endemic, slight skin abrasions should\r\nbe carefully treated with antiseptics. Yaws patients should be isolated\r\ntill cured, and their dwellings and personal possessions disinfected.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. *Syphilis.*\r\n\r\nSyphilis, due to _Treponema pallidum_ (sometimes called _Spirochæta\r\npallida_), is prevalent throughout the tropics as well as in\r\ntemperate zones. The disease is amenable to treatment by salvarsan\r\nand neo-salvarsan, for administration of which see relapsing fever\r\nand yaws. Galyl is also being used with favourable results. Lambkin’s\r\nmercury cream has been found useful in treating numerous cases in\r\nUganda. The life-history of the parasite is given on p. 124, and\r\nfurther medical details hardly come within the purview of this book.\r\n\r\n\r\nD. *Bronchial Spirochætosis.*\r\n\r\nBronchial spirochætosis, due to _Spirochæta bronchialis_ (see pp. 122,\r\n739) is probably of wide distribution in the tropics. The spirochætes\r\nhave been found in cases of chest complaints, especially those with\r\nbronchitic symptoms. The disease may be suspected in atypical cases of\r\npneumonia and bronchitis, and may be mistaken for incipient phthisis.\r\n\r\nChalmers and O’Farrell[453] (1913), writing from Khartoum, recommended\r\nrest in bed, good food and ventilation, coupled with treatment by\r\narsenic in some form, preferably associated with glycerophosphates.\r\nThese may be given by the mouth, or intramuscularly as an injection\r\nof:--\r\n\r\n  Sodium cinnamate           0·05 grm.\r\n  Sodium cacodylate          0·10  \"\r\n  Sodium glycerophosphate    0·10  \"\r\n\r\n[453] _Journ. Trop. Med. and Hyg._, xvi, p. 329.\r\n\r\nTaylor[454] (1913–14), writing from Entebbe, Uganda, prescribes\r\narsenious acid by the mouth in increasing doses. Creosote has been used\r\nin West Africa.\r\n\r\n[454] _Annual Med. and Sanit. Rept., Uganda_, for 1913, p. 80.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.--MALARIA.\r\n\r\nMalaria, known also under the names of ague, paludism, marsh fever,\r\nremittent fever, intermittent fever and climatic fever, among others,\r\nis a very widely spread disease. It is most prevalent in the equatorial\r\nregions and gradually diminishes north and south of the equator. The\r\nvarious malarial parasites (see pp. 155 to 172) are spread by species\r\nof Anophelines, and hence malaria is present in districts favourable\r\nto these intermediate hosts, that is, in places where there is a\r\nconsiderable amount of atmospheric moisture and rain, as well as heat.\r\n\r\nThe principal malarial parasites are: _Plasmodium vivax_, the agent of\r\nsimple tertian fever; _Plasmodium malariæ_, the parasite of quartan\r\nmalaria, and _Laverania malariæ_ or _Plasmodium falciparum_, producing\r\nmalignant tertian or sub-tertian malaria (and quotidian, see p. 167).\r\nThese various malarial fevers present certain clinical features in\r\ncommon, which will be stated here (see also pp. 155 to 157). For\r\nfurther particulars regarding malaria in all its aspects the reader is\r\nreferred to the book by Sir Ronald Ross on “The Prevention of Malaria,”\r\nto the “Manual of Tropical Medicine,” by Drs. Castellani and Chalmers,\r\nand to the “Tropical Diseases” of Sir Patrick Manson.\r\n\r\nTypical malarial fevers consist of a series of pyrexial attacks which\r\nrecur at definite intervals of twenty-four (quotidian), forty-eight or\r\nseventy-two hours, according to the parasite present in the patient’s\r\nblood. Each attack shows three stages, a stage of rigor, a heat stage\r\nand a stage of profuse perspiration. Following on these three stages,\r\nthere is an interval relatively or actually without pyrexia. Then the\r\nfever returns again. A rise of temperature, often accompanied by a\r\ngeneral feeling of malaise, may precede the initial stage of rigor.\r\nWhen the latter sets in, the patient feels intensely cold, shivers\r\nviolently, the skin becomes cold and the features pinched. There may\r\nbe violent vomiting and convulsive attacks in young children. The\r\ntemperature, however, is really above the normal, and continues to\r\nrise. After about an hour, the shivering abates and the heat stage\r\nsucceeds it. The temperature rises rapidly, even to 106° F. The patient\r\nbecomes very flushed, the pulse is rapid, headache may be intense and\r\nthe skin dry and burning. This stage, that causes acute distress to the\r\npatient, may last for one or often three to four hours, and then the\r\npatient commences to perspire profusely, the clothing and bedding often\r\nbeing saturated with sweat. After this, the fever rapidly declines, and\r\nwhen the sweating ceases, the patient may feel almost well although\r\nsomewhat languid. The sweating stage persists from two to four hours,\r\nso that the attack lasts as a rule from six to ten hours. After an\r\ninterval of one, two or three days, a recurrence takes place. During\r\nthe early part of the attack, especially at the stage of rigor, there\r\nis great splenic enlargement. At first the enlargement disappears in\r\nthe interval, but in the case of repeated attacks the spleen tends\r\nto become permanently enlarged. During malarial attacks and during\r\nthe intermission period, there is a great increase in the amount of\r\nnitrogen excreted by the kidneys, while the excretion of iron and bile\r\nin the fæces is increased.\r\n\r\nStitt[455] (1914) points out that it is characteristic of malignant\r\ntertian paroxysms that they set in with chilly sensations rather than a\r\nfrank, definite chill, and that the fever is of the remittent type.\r\n\r\n[455] “The Diagnostics and Treatment of Tropical Diseases.” London:\r\nH. K. Lewis.\r\n\r\n_Plasmodium malariæ_ and _P. vivax_ rarely produce marked lesions\r\nin the bodies of their hosts, as they sporulate in the circulating\r\nblood and so do not accumulate in any one organ. On the other hand,\r\n_Laverania malariæ_ (_Plasmodium falciparum_) multiplies within the\r\ninternal organs of its host, and consequently aggregates or clusters of\r\nthe parasites occur therein. The organ in which most sporulation occurs\r\nsuffers most. The liver is generally enlarged, soft and congested.\r\nThe capsule of the spleen is tense, but the splenic consistency is\r\nless than normal. The bone-marrow is often dark and congested in the\r\nspongy bones and brownish-red in long bones. The blood-capillaries of\r\nthe brain and spinal cord are often filled or blocked with sporulating\r\nparasites and large quantities of pigment are found in these organs.\r\nEven if the parasites are absent, the pigment is present in the\r\nendothelial cells. Pigment is found in most organs of the body.\r\n\r\nAtypical forms of malaria may occur in which some or all of the\r\nsymptoms are much modified. Irregular fevers also may be produced by\r\nsuccessive infections by the same parasite, or by the presence of two\r\ndifferent malarial parasites.\r\n\r\nAs regards the diagnosis of malaria, according to Manson the three\r\npathognomonic signs are--periodicity, the effect of quinine, and the\r\npresence of the malarial parasite.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The great specific for malaria is quinine. It attacks the\r\nmerozoites or asexual generation. The drug can be administered by the\r\nmouth, by the rectum, by intramuscular injections or by intravenous\r\ninjections, the two latter methods being adopted in serious infections\r\nor where gastric complications are present. When quinine is taken by\r\nthe mouth, the more soluble acid salts, _e.g._, quinine bihydrochloride\r\nand bisulphate, are better than the sulphate, the form in which quinine\r\nis usually sold. Tablets, pills and capsules are convenient means of\r\ntaking quinine but must not be old or hard, or they may pass unchanged\r\nthrough the body. In the case of mild tertian or quartan malaria,\r\nCastellani and Chalmers recommend the administration of a dose of\r\nquinine four hours before the sporulation of the parasite is due.\r\nAnother modification is to give 10 gr. of quinine by the mouth in the\r\nmorning and a second dose of 10 gr. as above. In many cases they give 5\r\nto 10 gr. of the drug three times a day. Administration of quinine _per\r\nrectum_ may be useful but they recommend intramuscular inoculation.\r\nThe solutions used must be sterile, and the “sterilettes,” small,\r\nhermetically sealed vials, containing 1 grm.) or 1/2 grm. (7-1/2 grm.)\r\nof quinine in solution, are recommended. A deep injection into the\r\ndeltoid or gluteus muscle is usual.\r\n\r\nFor pernicious infections, intravenous inoculation with not less than\r\n1 grm. at a time is recommended.\r\n\r\nAfter the fever has subsided, the administration of quinine in smaller\r\ndoses must be continued for some time, in order to avoid relapses.\r\n\r\nStitt (1914) writes that “there now seems to be a tendency to use\r\nthe alkaloid itself instead of its salts, it having been found that\r\nthe alkaloid and its very insoluble tannate are absorbed from the\r\ndigestive tract equally as well as the soluble salts.” Euquinine or\r\nethylcarbonate of quinine contains 81 per cent. of quinine, but is\r\nexpensive.\r\n\r\nDuring malarial attacks, constipation must not be allowed. Headache can\r\nbe relieved by cold applications, and perspiration must be encouraged\r\nin the early stage by hot tea, warm lime drinks, etc. After bad\r\nattacks, a change to a cooler climate is desirable, but the quinine\r\ntreatment must not be discontinued.\r\n\r\nPreventive measures take two main forms, directed respectively against\r\nthe malarial parasites in man, and against the mosquitoes that convey\r\nthe parasite from man to man.\r\n\r\nWith regard to man, houses should be built away from low-lying\r\nmarshy ground, and kept free from vegetation such as grass or brush\r\nwhich furnishes shelter to the mosquitoes. In the tropics, the chief\r\nreservoirs of the malarial parasites are the native children, hence\r\nEuropean quarters should be away from native dwellings as far as\r\npossible. Mosquito nets, having twenty to twenty-four meshes per\r\nsquare inch, should be used invariably, and houses should be screened.\r\nMalaria-conveying mosquitoes bite chiefly towards evening. Quinine\r\ntreatment for preventive purposes is important. A dose of 5 gr. of\r\nquinine daily, with a dose of 10 gr. on the seventh day (Castellani),\r\nis efficacious. Some workers, however, recommend a large dose (15 gr.)\r\non two consecutive days every eight or ten days for three months, while\r\nothers recommend 10 gr. twice a week. Celli administered 3 gr. of\r\nquinine morning and evening.\r\n\r\nThe second line of attack is directed against mosquitoes, especially\r\nAnophelines, on the lines so well set forth by Sir Ronald Ross.[456]\r\nThe accumulation of small quantities of water in various vessels, many\r\nof them unnecessary, should be prevented, as _Stegomyia_ (Culicines)\r\nbreed in such receptacles. Anophelines breed in small pools. All\r\ndrinking water and household vessels, water-butts and cisterns must be\r\neffectively screened with wire gauze. Cesspools, etc., must also be\r\nscreened, and they, and all collections of water, should be oiled with\r\ncrude petroleum sprays every week or ten days, or fortnight according\r\nto some workers. The petroleum is a good larvicide and suffocates the\r\nAnopheline larvæ, while its presence renders the site obnoxious to\r\nthe adult mosquitoes. The amount of crude petroleum or kerosene will\r\nvary according to the locality concerned, due regard being paid to its\r\npowers of spreading on the surface treated. Different authorities have\r\nused different quantities, such as 1 oz. of oil to 1 square yard or to\r\n15 square feet. Others have used 1 pint of the petroleum to a circle\r\nof 20 feet in diameter, while 1/2 pint for every 100 square feet of\r\nsurface has also been recommended. The larvicide used so successfully\r\nin Panama consisted of:--\r\n\r\n                                                        Average mixture\r\n  Crude carbolic acid (containing 15 per cent. phenol)    300 gallons\r\n  Caustic soda                                             30 lb.\r\n  Resin                                                   200 lb.\r\n\r\n[456] “The Prevention of Malaria.” Second Edition (1911). London: John\r\nMurray.\r\n\r\nOne part of this mixture in 5,000 parts of water containing mosquito\r\nlarvæ destroys them within five minutes; 1 part in 8,000 of water kills\r\nlarvæ in thirty minutes. Small fish, such as the “millions” fish, that\r\nfeed on the larvæ, can be introduced into collections of water and are\r\nof local service. Ducks may also act as destroyers of larvæ. The growth\r\nof water-weeds and rank vegetation, that affords shelter to the larvae,\r\nmust be prevented as far as possible.\r\n\r\nWherever possible hollows should be filled up, swamps and roads should\r\nbe well drained. Much good has followed the use of such measures in\r\nPanama, Egypt, British Guiana and other places. The ideal conditions\r\nfor malaria reduction appear to consist in a combination of general\r\nquinine prophylaxis with anti-mosquito measures.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.--BALANTIDIAN DYSENTERY.\r\n\r\nThis disease is also known as ciliate or ciliary dysentery. The chief\r\ncausal agent is _Balantidium coli_. Others are _Balantidium minutum_,\r\n_Nyctotherus faba_, etc. (see pp. 200–206).\r\n\r\nBalantidiasis is insidious and is marked by alternate attacks of\r\ndiarrhœa and constipation with vomiting, while mucus is passed in the\r\nmotions, which are foul smelling. There may be chronic ulceration of\r\nthe colon. Œdema of the face and limbs and anæmia may occur.\r\n\r\nTreatment is at present rather unsatisfactory. Castellani and Chalmers\r\nstate that “the symptomatic treatment for entamœbic dysentery may\r\nbe tried.” Various treatments, more or less empirical, by calomel,\r\nquinine, carbolic acid in pill form, salicylic acid, extract of male\r\nfern, methylene blue, iodine solution, rice water and tannin enemata\r\nare mentioned by Prowazek[457] (1913) and by Seifert. E. L. Walker[458]\r\n(1913) found, from experimental work, that organic compounds of\r\nsilver, _e.g._, protargol, were most effective. Local treatment\r\nby large enemata of collargol or protargol seems to be indicated.\r\nBehrenroth[459] (1913) successfully treated a Prussian case with\r\nthymol, given in 4 grm. doses every two days, followed at the end of\r\na fortnight by de-emetinized ipecacuanha, given in pills containing 6\r\ncg. each, to the number of thirty a day. In about another fortnight\r\nthe symptoms had subsided. The thymol checked the diarrhœa, but it\r\nwas necessary to give the de-emetinized ipecacuanha to kill off the\r\nbalantidia still present. Phillips (1915) also recommends thymol.\r\nArdin-Delteil, Raynaud, Coudray and Derrieu (1914) found neither\r\nemetine hydrochloride nor protargol of use.\r\n\r\n[457] Beihefte z. _Arch. f. Schiffs- u. Tropen-Hyg._, xvii, 6, p. 371.\r\n\r\n[458] _Philippine Jl. Sc._, Sect. B, viii, pp. 1–15, 333–349.\r\n\r\n[459] _Arch. f. Verdauungs Krankheiten_, xix, p. 42.\r\n\r\nAs regards prophylaxis Walker states that pigs “should be confined\r\nand not allowed to run in yards and dwellings.” Behrenroth considers\r\nthat dirty hands, for example, those of farm workers brought into\r\ncontact with pigs, are probably the medium of infection. The personal\r\ncleanliness of such persons is, then, of the greatest importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n   ------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  |This section, except for minor corrections, is practically a|\r\n  |translation of the original.                                |\r\n   ------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*PLATHELMINTHES* (Flat Worms).\r\n\r\nBY\r\n\r\nJ. W. W. STEPHENS, M.D., B.C., D.P.H.\r\n\r\n\r\nFASCIOLIASIS.\r\n\r\nFasciola hepatica.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of disease evoked by _Fasciola hepatica_ are rarely\r\nobserved in our part of the world, whereas Kermogant[460] states\r\nthem to be of frequent occurrence in Tonkin[461]; the parasites are\r\nthere called “Douves.” In our experience they are only accidentally\r\nfound _post mortem_ in a certain number of cases, as no changes are\r\nmanifested during life which would permit of any conclusion being drawn\r\nas to the presence of these parasites. In three cases (Bierner,[462]\r\nBostroem[463] and Sagarra[464]) icterus was present; in a fourth case,\r\nrecorded by Duffek,[465] the parasites had led to a severe and acute\r\ndistomiasis of the liver, combined with chronic purulent and ulcerative\r\ncholecystitis, with purulent cholangitis and dilation of the bile-ducts\r\nand numerous small abscesses of the liver. The total number of flukes\r\nfound in these cases amounted to about fifty. The parasites passed from\r\nthe duodenum into the bile-ducts, and first obstructed the flow of bile\r\nand then set up icterus, followed by cholecystitis and cholangitis.\r\n\r\n[460] Kermogant, _Soc. méd. des Hôp._, February 7, 1905.\r\n\r\n[461] [The distomiasis of Tonkin is due to _Clonorchis sinensis_ and\r\nnot to _F. hepatica_.--J.

Wochenschr._, 1902, xxx.\r\n\r\nAs regards localization of the liver fluke in the pharynx, see p. 242.\r\n\r\nThe treatment must be directed to the principal symptoms; prophylaxis\r\nis especially important in districts where distomiasis is of frequent\r\noccurrence. As the embryos live in water, only boiled or filtered\r\nwater should be drunk. The attempts of Tappeiner[466] to discover an\r\neffective remedy against liver-fluke disease (liver rot), so prevalent\r\namong sheep, were unsuccessful.\r\n\r\n[466] Tappeiner, _Münch. med. Wochenschr._, 1900, l.\r\n\r\n\r\nFasciolopsis buski.\r\n\r\nThis parasite lives in the intestine, not in the liver of man; it\r\nproduces bloody stools and typical symptoms--high fever and a condition\r\nof apathy (Odhner).[467]\r\n\r\n[467] Odhner, _Centrall l. f. Bakt._, 1902, xxxi.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARAGONIMIASIS.\r\n\r\nParagonimus ringeri.\r\n\r\nThe disease produced by the lung fluke is specially endemic in Japan,\r\nalso in isolated parts of China, Formosa and Korea. The fact that the\r\nlung-fluke disease is most frequently found in mountainous districts\r\n(Katsurada[468]) is worthy of special attention. The onset of pulmonary\r\nparagonimiasis is generally insidious (Looss[469]); generally the\r\nonly symptom is a slight cough, occurring at first at longer, and\r\nlater at shorter intervals; it is accompanied by the expectoration\r\nof discoloured sputum, frequently blood-stained. Though now and\r\nthen severe hæmorrhages result, up to the present no case has been\r\nestablished in which they have been the direct cause of death.\r\n\r\n[468] Katsurada, Ziegler’s _Beitr. z. path. Anat._, 1900, xxviii.\r\n\r\n[469] Looss, “Handb. d. Tropenkrankh.,” von Mense, 1905, i.\r\n\r\nExamination of the thorax frequently fails to reveal anything abnormal.\r\nInouye[470] states that the most frequently observed changes consist\r\nin retraction of the thorax and in a contraction of its infrascapular\r\nportion. Scheube[471] repeatedly observed that the one side, presumably\r\nthat which harboured the worm, moved less freely than the other. The\r\nphysical changes are not uniformly spread over the whole lung, but are\r\nlocalized. The disease may come to a standstill for long intervals and\r\nthen set in again, lasting on the whole from ten to twenty years. In\r\naddition to paragonimiasis of the lungs, cysts are frequently found\r\non the eyelids, which occasionally extend deeply into the orbit and\r\nhinder the movements of the eyes. _Post mortem_, cysts the size of\r\nhazel nuts containing one, two, or three adult worms are found in the\r\nlungs, and in addition, not uncommonly there exist pulmonary emphysema\r\nand bronchiectasis. Besides being present in the lungs and in the\r\neyelids, the parasites have also been found in the pleura, the liver,\r\nthe intestinal wall, the peritoneum, the cervical glands, and in the\r\nscrotum, without actually occasioning any actual symptoms in these\r\ntracts.\r\n\r\n[470] Inouye, quoted by Looss.\r\n\r\n[471] Scheube, “Die Krankh. d. warm. Länder,” 1896.\r\n\r\nThe most dangerous locality is in the brain. Otani,[472] Inouye,[473]\r\nYamagiva,[474] and recently also Taniguchi,[475] have found _post\r\nmortem_ the worms and their ova in tumours of the brain, or, in areas\r\nof softening in cases of Jacksonian epilepsy; in Taniguchi’s case the\r\neggs were found in masses in the inflammatory areas of softening. In\r\nthe nineteen cases of paragonimiasis of the brain collected by Inouye,\r\nthe following symptoms were observed: general convulsions on eight\r\noccasions, unilateral convulsions on six occasions, convulsions with\r\nparalysis on the same side and hemiplegia, five times each; in\r\nTaniguchi’s case, attacks of cortical epilepsy, choreiform twitchings\r\nin the right extremities, which gradually become athetotic. The\r\nfollowing were symptoms of rarer occurrence: paresis of the right upper\r\nextremity, vertigo, dementia, and amnesic aphasia, disturbances of\r\nvision. Paragonimiasis of the brain appears to arise by embolism from a\r\nprimary pulmonary lesion.\r\n\r\n[472] Otani, quoted by Looss.\r\n\r\n[473] Inouye, quoted by Looss.\r\n\r\n[474] Yamagiva, quoted by Looss\r\n\r\n[475] Taniguchi, _Arch. f. Psych. u. Nervenkrankh._, xxxviii.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis depends upon the finding of ova in the sputa; if together\r\nwith ova in the sputa, cerebral disturbances make their appearance, in\r\nall probability the cause is the presence of worms or ova in the brain.\r\n\r\nThe prognosis of pulmonary paragonimiasis is favourable; on the other\r\nhand, that of cerebral paragonimiasis is very doubtful.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of the pulmonary lesion consists only in paying attention\r\nto the general condition (good food, rest, cough remedies), as all\r\nattempts to destroy the worms in the lungs by means of vermicidal\r\ndrugs administered internally or by way of inhalation have so far\r\nbeen without result. The treatment of the cerebral lesion is entirely\r\nhopeless. Trephining has been proposed for cases the condition of which\r\nis more favourable, but it has not reached the stage of performance.\r\n\r\nProphylaxis consists in general management: cleansing and if need be\r\nboiling of everything that is eaten or drunk.\r\n\r\n\r\nClonorchis sinensis.\r\n\r\nAccording to our present knowledge _Clonorchis sinensis_ is only\r\nfound in China and Japan; even the _post-mortem_ case reported by\r\nLaspeyres[476] was that of an Asiatic sailor who was admitted into the\r\nGeneral Hospital St. George, Hamburg, in a moribund condition with\r\nthe clinical diagnosis of beri-beri. The bile-ducts are the usual\r\nsite of the parasite, though Katsurada[477] has found them also in\r\nthe pancreatic ducts. In addition, it is found not uncommonly in the\r\nupper portion of the small intestine, especially in the duodenum, also,\r\nthough decidedly rarely, in the stomach. As these sites, however, do\r\nnot afford the conditions necessary to life, they are only found here\r\non their way out of the body of the host.\r\n\r\n[476] Laspeyres, “Dissert. Kiel,” 1904.\r\n\r\n[477] Katsurada, Ziegler’s _Beitr. z. path. Anat._, 1900, xxviii.\r\n\r\nThe initial stage of infection with this fluke generally runs\r\na symptomless course; in proportion as the worms multiply the\r\nfollowing symptoms are manifested: First there is a morbid sense of\r\nhunger and irregularity in defæcation; at the same time the patient\r\nexperiences a feeling of pressure and pain in the epigastrium and\r\nright hypochondrium, or just a dull pain. Pressure increases the\r\npain considerably. The liver appears to be enlarged, sometimes the\r\nenlargement is specially perceptible over the left lobe of the liver.\r\nThe patients maintain a proportionately good general state of health\r\nin this state for a long time and may hope to recover. In severe cases\r\nthere occurs copious and generally bloody diarrhœa, also icterus.\r\nThe next stages are anæmia, emaciation, epistaxis, ascites, enlarged\r\nspleen, and cachexia, to which the patient finally succumbs. In general\r\nthe course of the disease is very chronic and irregular; in winter\r\nand spring there is generally improvement, in the summer and autumn\r\nthe patient gets worse. At _post-mortem_ the bile-ducts are enlarged\r\nand thickened, there is interstitial hepatitis with enlargement of\r\nthe liver, but not to such an extent as in hypertrophic cirrhosis.\r\nAfter the initial enlargement contraction of the liver sets in, the\r\nperitoneal coat and capsule proper of the liver become more or less\r\nthickened in places. In the pancreas also dilatation and thickening\r\nof the ducts occur, as well as interstitial inflammatory processes.\r\nObstructions in the portal circulation may lead to catarrhal changes in\r\nthe stomach.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis is based on the demonstration of ova in the fæces.\r\n\r\nAs a radical treatment is still unknown, consequently it can only be\r\npurely symptomatic. Prophylaxis consists in the prohibition of drinking\r\nunboiled water or eating uncooked molluscs, fish, etc., of canal water.\r\nLeaving the epidemic region may bring about gradual recovery.\r\n\r\n\r\nBILHARZIASIS.\r\n\r\nSchistosoma hæmatobium.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of bilharziasis are manifested chiefly in the urinary\r\napparatus, and above all as hæmaturia, at the outset without any\r\nspecial troubles. Later, however, it is accompanied by subjective\r\nsymptoms in the shape of feelings of pain, and of vague pains in the\r\nperinæum and lumbar region, and of burning in the urethra during\r\nthe passing of urine. All the symptoms are usually aggravated after\r\nexcesses in eating and drinking, and after considerable bodily\r\nexertion. Another condition found, but not often mentioned, is lipuria\r\n(Stock[478]); the highest amount has been 2 per cent. fat in the\r\nurine. Stock found 6 to 20 per cent. of eosinophile cells in ten\r\ncases examined by him. They appear to be increased, especially in\r\nthe early cases; Kautsky[479] also called attention to the excessive\r\ndegree of eosinophilia, whilst Goebel[480] expresses the opinion that\r\na specific toxic action on the organism generally is not developed\r\nin bilharziasis. Kautsky[481] assumes a toxic anæmia as in the case\r\nof ancylostomiasis. English authors also have called attention to\r\nthe eosinophilia and to a considerable amount of leucocytosis\r\n(Balfour,[482] Douglas and Hardy[483]). The severe forms occur almost\r\nexclusively in men; symptoms of catarrh of the bladder make their\r\nappearance, vesical calculi are frequently found, whilst the formation\r\nof stone in the kidneys and ureters is rare. Urethral fistula occurs\r\nin bilharziasis, often without stricture, and if granulations occur\r\nthe fistula is distal to them. Goebel[484] regards the bilharzia\r\nfistula as a chronic burrowing of pus, caused by the irritation set up\r\nby the ova as foreign bodies and consecutive restricted suppuration;\r\nand secondly as due to the passage of urine through the defect in the\r\nepithelium or the wall of the urethra. The fistulæ, which are generally\r\nsituated at the neck of the bladder and at the membranous portion, are\r\nvery tortuous and frequently very numerous; they often lie embedded\r\nin well-marked tumours--in fact, in granulation tumours with marked\r\ninclination to excessive formation of cicatricial tissue. The opening\r\ngenerally is in the perineal and scrotal regions. In the case of a\r\npatient, aged 21, from the Transvaal, Kutner[485] found by cystoscopic\r\nexaminations the whole summit and walls of the bladder covered with\r\nlarge and small tumours. In addition to smooth glistening tumours,\r\nothers were more or less disintegrated, and scattered large and small\r\ncauliflower-like growths occurred. Like malignant growths, the tumours\r\nwere inclined to break down, the process extending from within outwards\r\ntowards the surface. Whether the hydrocele so frequent in Egypt has\r\nany connection with bilharzia is not known. A frequent sequela of\r\nbilharziasis is complete sexual impotence (Petrie[486]).\r\n\r\n[478] Stock, _Lancet_, September 29, 1906.\r\n\r\n[479] Kautsky, _Wien. klin.

Journ._, July, 1903.\r\n\r\nBilharziasis of the rectum is manifested by symptoms of dysentery; the\r\nrepeated violent attempts at defæcation lead in time to prolapse of the\r\nrectum, which sooner or later induces septic infection and so death.\r\nIn the mucosa of the rectum, polypoid growths similar to those in the\r\nbladder are met with, due to the ova of the parasites in the mucosa\r\nand submucosa. In the case of a man, aged 36, who had lived for a long\r\ntime in South Africa, Burfield[487] found in the excised vermiform\r\nappendix ova of _Schistosoma hæmatobium_; he assumed this to be a\r\ngradual secondary infection of the appendix, whilst Kelly[488] mentions\r\na case of primary bilharziasis of the appendix; the eggs lay in the\r\nsubmucosa directly above the muscularis. Tumours containing numerous\r\nova are frequently found in the region of the genitalia, thighs and\r\nscrotum. In one case Symmers[489] found numerous male schistosomes\r\nin the portal blood and a copulating pair in the left lung. Though\r\nschistosome eggs have been found by some observers in the lung tissue,\r\nthis is nevertheless the first case in which living parasites have been\r\nfound in the lesser circulation. Perhaps they got there by way of the\r\nexternal iliac vein from the veins of the bladder and rectum.\r\n\r\n[487] Burfield, _Lancet_, February 10, 1906.\r\n\r\n[488] Kelly, quoted by Burfield.\r\n\r\n[489] Symmers, _Lancet_, January 7, 1905.\r\n\r\nIn the female sex bilharziasis is incomparably rarer than in the male\r\nand is generally limited to hæmaturia. Bilharziasis of the vagina,\r\nwhich takes the form of an acute vaginitis, is frequent according to\r\nMilton.[490] Horwood[491] found in one case a polypoid tumour of the\r\ncervix uteri, and in the connective tissue of the tumour Schistosoma\r\nova, both in masses and singly. It could not be established whether the\r\nova reached the vagina and thence the cervix directly, or through the\r\nurine from the bladder.\r\n\r\n[490] Milton, quoted by Looss, “Handb. d. Tropenkrankh.,” v. Mense,\r\n1905, i, p. 95.\r\n\r\n[491] Horwood, _Brit. Med. Journ._, March 10, 1906.\r\n\r\nThe course of the disease is chronic, and in slight cases, provided\r\nfresh infections do not occur, is not unfavourable; in severe cases the\r\ncachexia caused by loss of blood, or intercurrent diseases to which the\r\npatients easily succumb--_e.g._, pyelitis, pyelonephritis, pyæmia, or\r\nuræmia--lead to a fatal issue.\r\n\r\nIn regions in which _Schistosoma hæmatobium_ is endemic, or in patients\r\nfrom such regions, the diagnosis is easy by microscopically finding the\r\neggs in the urine.\r\n\r\nAs regards the treatment of the affection this much must be said, that\r\nso far there is in existence no certain remedy. In countries where\r\nbilharziasis is endemic copaiva balsam is considered a specific. Kutner\r\n(_loc. cit._), however, in the case of his patient who for a long\r\ntime had taken no inconsiderable amounts of copaiva, had no success\r\nworth speaking of to record. Urotropin (three times daily, 1 grm.)\r\nhas similarly failed, salol (0·75 grm. several times daily) perhaps\r\naffords relief in affection of the bladder (Milton). Methylene blue,\r\noil of turpentine with extract of male fern (Brock[492]), or the latter\r\nalone and santonin given in small doses for a week at a time, in the\r\nmorning, are said by Petrie[493] to be of value. Sandwith[494] and\r\nHarley[495] were not very successful. By way of experiment Kutner for\r\nsome time used collargol _per rectum_, proceeding on the assumption\r\nthat this preparation, which has proved of such remarkable service\r\nin bacterial infection, would perhaps render a continuance of life\r\ndifficult for the bilharzia worms. But this hope proved illusory. In\r\norder so far as possible to limit the loss of blood, Kutner regularly\r\nemployed stypticin for long periods (three times daily, two tabloids\r\nof 0·01 grm.) with undoubted success, in so far that the hæmorrhages\r\nbecame considerably less in amount. As two patients in the course\r\nof enteric fever lost their hæmaturia, Stock accordingly recommends\r\nsubcutaneous injections of Wright’s typhoid vaccine. In the early\r\nstages of the rectal lesion suppositories of iodoform, ichthyol, or\r\nnarcotics might possibly be of use. In the case of urethral fistulæ,\r\ndivision, excision and scraping out of the granulation tissue are\r\nrecommended; in cystitis with formation of tumours high resection with\r\ncuretting of the tumours or their destruction with the cautery; in the\r\ncase of vesical calculi, high resection, curetting the bladder, and\r\nthen drainage.

The favourable influence\r\nof change of climate can only show itself where fresh infections are\r\navoided.\r\n\r\n\r\nCESTODES.\r\n\r\nGENERAL.\r\n\r\nIt seems advisable to preface the section on the Cestodes with some\r\ngeneral observations on the symptoms of disease provoked by tapeworms,\r\nespecially so far as they relate to the question of toxic effects, and\r\nto include the Nematodes in this discussion. After this will follow\r\na brief exposition of the most important intestinal lesions causally\r\nconnected with intestinal parasites.\r\n\r\nIt is known to every experienced practitioner that the different\r\nintestinal parasites can give rise to a series of nervous symptoms,\r\nslight or severe, and produce, above all, blood changes--anæmia of the\r\nmost varied nature, to the extent of severe progressive anæmia. These\r\nsymptoms are regarded by many authors as reflex, or, as in the case of\r\nancylostomiasis, the main feature from the loss of blood caused by the\r\nhabit of life of the intestinal parasites. More frequently, however,\r\nthey are regarded as toxic conditions produced by the parasites. In\r\nview of this divergence of opinion there appears to be some advantage\r\nin defining clearly the present position as to the toxic action of\r\nparasites. Most interesting in this respect are _Dibothriocephalus\r\nlatus_ and _Ancylostoma duodenale_.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to the clinic at Helsingfors for our most detailed\r\nknowledge of bothriocephalus anæmia. Reyher[496] was the first to\r\ndemonstrate that this parasite under certain circumstances can produce\r\na severe, progressive and sometimes fatal anæmia, which can be cured,\r\ngenerally in a surprisingly short time, by expulsion of the worm.\r\nAmong the various hypotheses which have been advanced as to the mode\r\nof origin of bothriocephalus anæmia, the greatest importance has been\r\nattached to the assumption already mentioned by Reyher, but definitely\r\nexpressed by von Shapiro,[497] to the effect that _Bothriocephalus\r\nlatus_ produces a poison which is absorbed by the intestine and\r\nexercises a deleterious influence on the composition of the blood,\r\nespecially on the erythrocytes, perhaps also on the blood-forming\r\norgans. This assumption is supported by no slight number of clinical\r\nand experimental investigations. Podwissotsky[498] observed severe\r\nblood changes in a child, aged 4-1/2, affected with _B. latus._\r\nIn the case reported by Pariser[499] the severe anæmia in a girl\r\ndisappeared fairly soon after expulsion of the worm. In that reported\r\nby Schaumann[500] high fever accompanied the bothriocephalus anæmia;\r\nhe also proved the hæmolytic properties of the broad tapeworm. The\r\ncase reported by F. Müller[501] was one of severe anæmia. Also, in\r\nthe first of the cases described by Kurimoto[502] of _Diplogonoporus\r\ngrandis_ there were present the same symptoms of anæmia as in the case\r\nof _B. latus_. Meyer[503] observed severe anæmia in two youths caused\r\nby _B. latus_. Rosenquist[504] has discussed the proteid metabolism in\r\nanæmia. The presence of _B. latus_ produces in the majority of cases\r\nan increased proteid consumption, to which the blood change generally\r\ncorresponds--toxic anæmia; in a further communication he reports on\r\ntwenty cases of bothriocephalus anæmia, nineteen of which were cured\r\nby expulsion of the worms, while one case proved fatal, and he again\r\nemphasizes the toxic properties of the intestinal parasites. In the\r\ncase reported by Bendix,[505] that of a girl, aged 4-1/2, the anæmia\r\nwas moderate, whilst in the case of Zinn[506] (a woman, aged 30) the\r\nanæmia was so excessive that the patient succumbed five days after\r\nexpulsion of six bothriocephalus heads. Isaac and van den Velden[507]\r\nhave established that in the serum of patients who suffer from anæmia\r\ndue to _B. latus_, parasitic products are dissolved, as shown by\r\na distinct precipitin reaction. Galli-Valerio[508] considers it\r\nlikely that toxic substances are secreted by the living helminthes\r\nwhich produce a lowering or raising of the body temperature, nervous\r\ndisturbances and hæmolysis. Tallqvist[509] succeeded in extracting from\r\n_B. latus_ a lipoid-like body which had a strong hæmolytic action. The\r\nexperimental anæmia thereby produced differed in no respect from the\r\nsevere chronic bothriocephalus anæmia of man. The question as to under\r\nwhat special conditions severe, and sometimes fatal bothriocephalus\r\nanæmia is developed is answered by Leichtenstern[510] and by\r\nLenhartz,[511] by the assumption that among the Bothriocephali some are\r\ntoxic, that is, manufacture a poison which, when absorbed by the host,\r\nproduces a severe anæmia.\r\n\r\n[496] Reyher, _Deutsch.

As is shown by a\r\nshort historical résumé of the toxic action that has to be considered\r\nin ancylostome anæmia, we must admit that doubtless here, as in the\r\ncase of bothriocephalus anæmia, the toxins secreted by the parasites\r\nexercise a hæmolytic action, even while admitting Leichtenstern’s\r\ncontention that the significance of the loss of blood due to\r\nancylostomes must not be underrated. The toxic hypothesis acquired a\r\ndefinite standing through a series of experiments of Lussana[513] on\r\nrabbits, where he succeeded in producing anæmia by injecting urinary\r\nextracts of ancylostome patients. Arslan[514] extracted toxins from the\r\nurine of two ancylostome patients and injected them into rabbits, which\r\nthereupon sickened and showed the same blood changes as the ancylostome\r\npatients. Retinal hæmorrhages, so frequent in ancylostome anæmia,\r\nwhich, according to Fischer[515] and Samelsohn,[516] are not due to\r\ndirect loss of blood, must also be ascribed to a parasitic toxin. A\r\nfurther argument in favour of the toxic hypothesis is furnished by\r\nthe blood changes recorded by Zappert,[517] Müller and Rieder,[518]\r\nBücklers,[519] and Neusser,[520] which must be regarded as the\r\nexpression of toxic action, especially with reference to eosinophilia.\r\nThe striking increase in proteid destruction in ancylostomiasis\r\nobserved by Bohland,[521] and which ceased after the parasites had been\r\nexpelled, also gives additional support to the assumption of toxic\r\naction. The observation of Daniels[522] also deserves consideration in\r\nthis connection, according to which the presence of yellow pigment in\r\nthe liver and kidney cells is to be attributed to blood destruction by\r\na verminous toxin absorbed from the gut. Looss[523] considers it not at\r\nall improbable--in fact, almost certain--that Ancylostoma, in addition\r\nto withdrawing blood, exert a kind of toxic action on their host.\r\n\r\n[512] Leichtenstern, _Deutsch. med.

Bakt._, 1897.\r\n\r\nScheube[524] attributes almost equal importance to the loss of blood,\r\nthe digestive disturbances, and the intoxication induced by certain\r\nmetabolic products of the parasites. According to v. Jaksch[525]\r\nancylostome anæmia is not induced solely by loss of blood, but by the\r\nfact that the parasites produce a ferment which has a toxic action\r\nand produces stimulation in those organs in which the eosinophile\r\ncells arise. The hæmolytic action of ancylostomes has frequently been\r\nobserved by Galvagno[526] in men employed in sulphur mines. According\r\nto Loeb and Smith[527] the anterior half of the body of ancylostomes\r\ncontains a substance which probably causes anæmia. Bauer[528] found in\r\nthe urine of ancylostome patients glycuronic acid, which he considers\r\nto be a sign of metabolic disturbance due to parasitic toxins. As has\r\nbeen demonstrated by Allessandrini,[529] the secretion of glands in\r\nthe anterior part of the body has a distinct hæmolytic effect on the\r\nerythrocytes. While the worm attaches itself to the mucosa by means of\r\nits teeth, these glands discharge their secretion, producing hyperæmia.\r\nThe extravasated blood is acted on by this secretion, so that it can\r\nserve as food for the parasites. Hynek[530] attributes eosinophilia (up\r\nto 20 per cent.) to a toxic action. Goldmann[531] expresses a similar\r\nopinion, though he assumes that the anæmia is secondary, as the toxin\r\nof the cephalic glands, as the parasites bite, penetrates the mucosa\r\nand thence into the blood, where it dissolves the red blood corpuscles.\r\nRomani[532] discusses the agglutinating hæmolytic action of the serum\r\nof ancylostome patients. Whether Ancylostoma produce toxins and what\r\nis their nature, or whether the loss of blood causes the anæmia,\r\nLiefmann[533] was unable definitely to determine; hæmolytic substances\r\ndo not appear to take any part in it.\r\n\r\n[524] Scheube, “Die Krankh. der warm.

Hyg._, 1905, l.\r\n\r\nBerti[534] also is inclined to attribute the anæmia to metabolic\r\nproducts of the ancylostomes; he found, in fact, that a serum obtained\r\nfrom a sheep (after subcutaneous injections of the culture fluid of\r\nancylostome larvæ) was efficacious in the treatment of ancylostome\r\nanæmia. Peiper[535] likewise assumes that the parasite secretes a cell\r\ntoxin. Löbker[536] at the present day still maintains that the cause\r\nof the disease must be looked for really, if not perhaps entirely, in\r\nthe continued withdrawal of blood by the parasites; the secretion of\r\ntoxins by ancylostomes has not yet, in his opinion, been conclusively\r\nproved. Except in the case of _Bothriocephalus latus_, referred to\r\npreviously, toxic action appears to be of quite subordinate importance\r\nfor the other Cestodes occurring in man--especially _Tænia solium_\r\nand _T. saginata_, which are most frequently found; thus Cao[537]\r\nflatly denies the presence of toxins in the body of Tæniæ, while\r\nothers, such as Messineo and Calmida,[538] Jammes and Mandoul,[539]\r\nconsider they are justified from their investigations in concluding\r\nthat Tæniæ contain a specific toxin. Messineo[540] injected, with\r\nall bacteriological precautions, extracts of Tænia, dissolved in\r\nphysiological salt solution. He invariably obtained severe motor\r\ndisturbances and frequently death. The observation by Pereira[541] of\r\na case of chorea in which rheumatic and cardiac symptoms were absent\r\nand which after expulsion of a Tænia was quickly cured, also favours\r\nthe view of a toxic action. Barnabo,[542] however, was unable to\r\nobtain a toxin from _Tænia saginata_. Gagnoni,[543] on account of a\r\nmarked eosinophilia which, after expulsion of a _Tænia saginata_, fell\r\nwithin fourteen days to 1 per cent., assumes the formation of a Tænia\r\ntoxin. Dirksen’s[544] observation has reference to a sailor affected\r\nwith serious anæmia, who, after expulsion of twelve pieces of _Tænia\r\nsolium_, was rapidly cured. A portion of the worm was already breaking\r\ndown, the absorption introducing into the body highly toxic hæmolytic\r\nproducts, to which the anæmia must be ascribed. How far the serious\r\ndisturbances of the nervous system, frequently to be observed in cases\r\nof _Hymenolepis nana_, are to be considered as of purely reflex nature\r\nor toxic must remain an open question; the same applies to _Dipylidium\r\ncaninum_, in which case Brandt[545] observed serious central nervous\r\nsymptoms. Caution is necessary in judging as to any connection between\r\nworm stimulus and nervous symptoms in cases of Ascaris infection.\r\nPeiper[546] is inclined to regard such nervous symptoms not as reflex,\r\nbut rather as due to a toxin contained in the helminthes, or metabolic\r\nin origin.\r\n\r\n[534] Berti, _Gaz. d.

In a case of Kutner’s,[548] that of a girl,\r\naged 12, there was a hæmolysis which was cured after expulsion of\r\ntwenty-four _Ascaridæ_. Attacks of opisthotonos in a girl, aged 16,\r\nceased after seventy-eight _Ascaridæ_ had been expelled (Lutz[549]).\r\nUnusually serious disturbances were observed in a man, aged 26,\r\nwho was rapidly cured by Drouillard[550] by the removal of a great\r\nnumber of _Ascaridæ_. The observations on pseudomeningitis are of\r\nespecial interest; they are evidently toxic in origin as in the case\r\nof Annaratone,[551] of a man who was taken ill with gastro-intestinal\r\nsymptoms and who died with meningitic symptoms. _Post mortem_ the brain\r\nwas normal, but the stomach contained a great coil of _Ascaridæ_.\r\nThe cases of Delille,[552] Mériel,[553] Papi[554] (the occurrence of\r\nCheyne-Stokes respiration has been ascribed to the action upon the\r\ncentre in the medulla oblongata of the products of the _Ascaridæ_),\r\nand Taillens[555] related to children in which the meningitic\r\nsymptoms (meningismus), partly serious, disappeared with the removal\r\nof the _Ascaridæ_. Máreo[556] designates this disease helminthiasis\r\nmeningitiformis, which exhibits all the symptoms of meningitis, but\r\nwhich is caused by the metabolic products of _Ascaridæ_.\r\n\r\n[547] Demme, _vide_ Seifert, _ibid._\r\n\r\n[548] Kutner, _Berl. klin.

Schupfer assumes in such cases, as he observed\r\nit once in a man, aged 23, that the disease termed _Lombricoise à\r\nforme typhoïde_ by Chauffard was due to _B. coli_ of marked virulence\r\ndue to the action of the _Ascaridæ_. The Widal reaction was negative.\r\nKoneff[561] reports a case in which acute attacks of cramp, trismus,\r\nand rigidity of the pupil disappeared after expulsion of seven\r\n_Ascaridæ_. Tetanus, as observed by Buchholz[562] in a girl, aged 17,\r\nand rapidly cured after expulsion of sixteen _Ascaridæ_, is manifestly\r\nrare, since only Rose[563] mentions this as a cause in his article on\r\nTetanus. Only a few experimental data exist. Cattaneo[564] could detect\r\nonly a very weak toxin in Ascaris, while Messineo,[565] by injecting\r\ninto animals extracts in physiological salt solution, invariably\r\nsucceeded in producing serious motor disturbances and frequently death.\r\nInteresting also are the observations of Huber,[566] who, after working\r\nwith _Ascaridæ_, suffered from itching of the head and neck, blisters,\r\nswelling of the ear, conjunctivitis, ecchymosis and troublesome\r\npalpitation in the head. He consequently assumes that _Ascaridæ_ can\r\ninduce irritation by chemical (toxic) means.\r\n\r\n[557] Schupfer, _Gaz. d.

Barth[567]\r\nfound the brain normal in a man who had died with meningitic symptoms,\r\nbut the intestines were full of _Trichocephalus dispar_; Gibson[568]\r\nrecords the rapid cure of serious cerebral symptoms after expulsion of\r\nTrichocephalus, so also Pascal,[569] Burchhardt[570] and Rippe.[571]\r\nMoosbrugger[572] was the first to draw attention to grave anæmic\r\nconditions induced by Trichocephalus, Morsasca[573] and Becker[574]\r\nto progressive grave anæmia (trichocephalus anæmia is accompanied by\r\nmarked reduction of the number of red blood corpuscles, of the specific\r\ngravity and of the hæmoglobin, well-marked morphological changes of the\r\nred cell, micro-, macro-, and poikilocytosis and nucleated red cells).\r\nSandler,[575] in his case of a boy, aged 11, who died of anæmia,\r\nassumes a trichocephalus toxin to be the cause of the disease, and\r\nKahane also reports on anæmic conditions induced by Trichocephalus.\r\nGirard,[576] in addition to symptoms in the gastro-intestinal\r\ntract, calls attention to those arising in the blood--anæmia and\r\nits sequelæ--and also to nervous symptoms: cerebral phenomena,\r\nheadache, giddiness, aphonia, symptoms of meningitis. In a case of\r\nSchiller’s[577] high fever was present, which probably set in when\r\nthe Trichocephali present in the gut in great numbers commenced their\r\nparasitic activity. Hausmann,[578] in order to explain the adaptability\r\nof Trichocephalus, assumes that according to the _locus minoris\r\nresistentiæ_, at one time the reflex at another the toxic action is\r\neffective, now on one organ, then on another; anæmia being present in\r\nmost cases, frequently general and local neuroses and cerebral symptoms\r\nof various kinds.\r\n\r\n[567] Barth, reported by Valleix, Paris, 1845.\r\n\r\n[568] Gibson, _Lancet_, 1862.\r\n\r\n[569] Pascal, quoted by Kahane, _Korrespondenzbl. f.

Nervous disturbances and blood changes can but rarely be\r\nattributed to Strongyloides. Silvester[580] and Valdes[581] report on\r\ngiddiness, headache and anuria in cases observed by them; whether the\r\neosinophilia recorded by Bücklers[582] and Bruns[583] is due to the\r\ntoxin of Strongyloides must remain an open question.\r\n\r\n[579] Hartmann, _Naturforschervers._, Köln, 1889.\r\n\r\n[580] Silvester, quoted by Schlüter, “Dissert. Kiel,” 1905.\r\n\r\n[581] Valdes, quoted by Schlüter, _op. cit._\r\n\r\n[582] Bücklers, _Münch. med. Wochenschr._, 1894.\r\n\r\n[583] Bruns, _Münch. med. Wochenschr._, 1907.\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to the possibility that intestinal\r\nciliates (_Balantidium coli_) can also produce toxins.\r\n\r\nThe contents of echinococcus cysts appear to contain a substance only\r\nmoderately toxic, giving rise to urticaria, in a series of cases where\r\nthe fluid has escaped into the abdominal cavity (during puncture). D.\r\nMüller[584] has collected nine such cases out of the literature, to\r\nwhich may be added six cases of Finsen[585] in which the escape of\r\nfluid into the peritoneal cavity led to severely itching urticaria,\r\nwhich usually disappeared again after one or two days. On one occasion,\r\nindeed, urticaria occurred after rupture into the pleural cavity.\r\nIn the case recorded by Caffarena[586] of echinococcus of the right\r\nlobe of the liver, widespread urticaria developed as the result of\r\nthe exploratory puncture. In the case of an echinococcus of the liver\r\nrupturing into the abdominal cavity La Spada[587] ascribed the symptoms\r\nleading to death to toxic influence while the peritoneal symptoms were\r\nless marked. Eosinophilia in hydatid disease is slight according to\r\nthe investigations of Bindi[588] and Santucci,[589] and is, according\r\nto Welsh and Barling,[590] no certain sign of echinococcus; it is\r\nindependent of the age, sex and temperature of the patient, but upon\r\nrupture of the cyst eosinophilia invariably sets in.\r\n\r\n[584] Müller, D., “Dissert.

The entrance of\r\nintestinal parasites into the vermiform appendix was already known to\r\nmedical men in the fifties of last century, as is shown by the works\r\nof Merling[591] (1836), Zebert[592] (1859), Platonor[593] (1853),\r\nand Schachtinger[594] (1861). Most of these authors have considered\r\nintestinal worms, together with other foreign bodies, to be the cause\r\nof appendicitis. As regards the part played by these intestinal\r\nparasites in the etiology of appendicitis, so much discussion has taken\r\nplace during the last few years that it is worth while to give a résumé\r\nof the later views on this question, even though at the outset it must\r\nbe admitted that the matter is not cleared up. Bergmann[595] records\r\na case in which an Ascaris perforated the appendix and got into the\r\nperitoneal cavity.\r\n\r\n[591] quoted by Rostowzeff, _Bobritsch. Gaz. Botkina_, 1902.\r\n\r\n[592] quoted by Rostowzeff, _Bobritsch. Gaz. Botkina_, 1902.\r\n\r\n[593] quoted by Rostowzeff, _Bobritsch. Gaz. Botkina_, 1902.\r\n\r\n[594] quoted by Rostowzeff, _Bobritsch. Gaz. Botkina_, 1902.\r\n\r\n[595] Bergmann, _Prag. med. Wochenschr._, 1890.\r\n\r\nStrümpell[596] reckons among the symptoms of Trichocephalus the\r\npossibility of a “typhlitis.” On account of the marked sensitiveness of\r\nthe ileo-cæcal region, Boas[597] mentions the possibility of confusing\r\nit with appendicitis. Still[598] regards Oxyuris as a principal\r\ncause of catarrhal affections of the appendix. Arboré-Rally[599]\r\nregarded severe symptoms of appendicitis in a boy, aged 10, as due to\r\nAscarides. In all cases of appendicitis Metschnikoff[600] requires a\r\nmicroscopical examination to be made for eggs, and considers treatment\r\nfor worms carried out otherwise as a cause of the frequency of\r\nperityphlitis. Matignon[601] does not agree with this opinion, as in\r\nspite of the extraordinary frequency of intestinal worms in China,\r\nhe has only seen one case of appendicitis in four and a half years,\r\nand Des Barres[602] expresses himself in similar fashion. Out of\r\ntwenty-one cases of appendicitis Kirmisson[603] discovered the ova\r\nof Trichocephalus eighteen times and the ova of Ascarides in three\r\nof these cases; in twelve cases of enteric fever the examination for\r\neggs was negative nine times. Moty[604] considers Oxyuris to be the\r\nsole cause in his three cases of appendicitis. Girard[605] ascribes to\r\nTrichocephali the _rôle_ of more or less septic foreign bodies which\r\nmay bring about the entry of intestinal bacteria into the appendix,\r\nand Triboulet[606] describes a case of appendicitis which he considers\r\nwas due to Ascaris. In Morkowitin’s[607] case numerous Oxyuris had\r\nclearly caused the appendicitis. von Genser[608] records the case of\r\na boy, aged 5, who was operated on for appendicitis, and who passed\r\nthrough the operation wound a living Ascaris on the eighteenth day\r\nafter the operation. In the first case communicated by Schiller[609]\r\nthe disappearance of the typhlitic swelling after the discharge of the\r\nAscarides pointed to the etiological significance of the parasites,\r\nand the same obtained in a further case published at an earlier date\r\nby Czerny and Heddäus.[610] In a case abstracted by Kaposi[611]\r\nTrichocephali appear to have been a contributory cause in the\r\nproduction of the appendicitis. In a further case reported by Schiller,\r\nwhere the appendix was removed, it was shown that Oxyuris had given\r\nrise to a pronounced appendicular colic. In a girl, aged 13, who died\r\nfrom diffuse peritonitis, Schwankhaus[612] found that an Ascaris had\r\nperforated the appendix. Ramstedt[613] found in an extirpated appendix\r\na whole “tangle” of Oxyuris, and believes in the possibility of their\r\nhaving provoked the inflammation; he recommends an examination for\r\nentozoa before the operation, without, however, after Metschnikoff’s\r\nexample, substituting worm treatment for the operation. Rostowzeff[614]\r\nascribes only a minimal direct etiological significance to intestinal\r\nworms in the origin of appendicitis; in 163 cases he found worms\r\nin three instances. Wirsaladze[615] expresses himself in a similar\r\nfashion. Oppe[616] observed Oxyuris six times in excised appendices,\r\nand emphasizes the opinion that in appendicitis the question of a\r\nworm cure ought to be taken into consideration. Ascaris and Oxyuris,\r\nif no contra-indication exists, may be expelled, but in the case of\r\nTrichocephalus, which frequently defies all expulsive treatment, no\r\nattempt should be made, but operation proceeded to forthwith. In\r\na case briefly reported by Hanau[617] Oxyuris was undoubtedly the\r\netiological starting-point; in a case of Galli-Vallerio[618] Oxyuris\r\nand Trichocephalus. In the opinion of Ssaweljews[619] in some cases of\r\nappendicitis, in addition to other causes, intestinal parasites play\r\na prominent part. The case recorded by Nason[620] is an interesting\r\none; in this an Ascaris in the appendix became twisted with it round\r\na coil of gut, causing obstruction. Spieler[621] argues against the\r\nunderestimation by many authors as to the part played by intestinal\r\nworms in producing appendicitis, although he also does not regard\r\nthem as a frequent, to say nothing of an exclusive, cause of the\r\ndisease. In a case recorded by Bégonin[622] fifteen Oxyuris were found\r\nin the excised appendix (the mucosa showed some ulceration), and in\r\nanother recorded by Putnam[623] twenty Oxyuris were present in the\r\nappendix, in which there was no evidence of any change. The standpoint\r\nSchilling[624] takes is to the effect that entozoa irritate the mucosa\r\nand can increase an already existing inflammation, but he considers it\r\nvery questionable whether they can produce appendicitis. Blanchard[625]\r\nassumes the possibility of a secondary infection arising from lesions\r\nof the mucosa produced by helminthes (Ascaris and Oxyuris). Moore[626]\r\nconsiders Trichocephalus the excitant of the appendicitis in his case.\r\nIn a second case of appendicitis recorded by Auley[627] operation\r\nbecame unnecessary owing to the passage of the _Ascaridæ_. Page’s[628]\r\ncase is an interesting one; it was that of a man who came up for\r\noperation with a diagnosis of appendicitis. On incising the abdominal\r\nwall numerous Ascarides were found at the base of the wound, lying in\r\ncavities; even after eight days Ascarides escaped from the wound. The\r\nauthor assumes there was a perforation of the gut wall; it is strange\r\nthat the worms were able to exist a proportionately long time in the\r\nmuscular tissue. Schoeppler[629] states that there is the danger of an\r\nappendicitis even after the death of an Oxyuris that has found its way\r\ninto the appendix. Oui[630] met with two specimens of Trichocephalus\r\nwhich had become embedded by their thin ends deep in the mucosa.\r\nFrangenheim[631] is not in a position to pronounce any opinion as to\r\nwhat part intestinal parasites play in the etiology of appendicitis.\r\nIn a case recorded by Kahane[632] many Trichocephali were found partly\r\nfree in the appendix and partly embedded in the mucosa; microscopically\r\nappendicitis was diagnosed. At a laparotomy for salpingitis Heekes[633]\r\nfound the appendix elongated, thickened, and containing about eleven\r\nOxyuris without the mucosa being in any way changed. In one case\r\nAndrews[634] claims Ascarides to have been the direct cause of the\r\nappendicitis. The literature dealing with this question, so important\r\nin our time, has been collected almost without any omissions, but,\r\nunfortunately, no decisive opinion as to the significance of parasites\r\nin appendicitis can be inferred from it. The vexed question whether\r\nintestinal parasites, especially Ascaris, are able to penetrate the\r\nintestinal wall is just as little finally decided. Leuckart,[635]\r\nHeller,[636] Mosler and Peiper,[637] Henoch,[638] Davaine,[639]\r\nKüchenmeister,[640] and Bremser[641] are opposed to the idea that\r\nthe healthy intestinal wall can be penetrated by intestinal worms,\r\nespecially Ascarides, whilst a whole series of other authors are of\r\nthe opinion that even the healthy intestinal mucosa can be perforated.\r\nAmong these is numbered Mondière,[642] who is of the opinion that\r\nAscaris, by violent pressure against the mucosa, forces it so much\r\napart that it is enabled to escape through the gap thus formed into\r\nthe peritoneal cavity; this opinion is shared by v. Siebold.[643]\r\nRokitansky[644] considers perforation of the gut by Ascaris as at\r\nleast a rare occurrence. Gerhardt[645] does not doubt that the worms\r\ncan actively perforate the intestine. Cases like those of Abrault,[646]\r\nApostolides,[647] Marcus[648] (recorded by Perls as a valid example of\r\n“ascaridophagous” gut perforation), Wischnewsky,[649] Galvagno,[650]\r\nSalieri[651] certainly show that perforation of the healthy gut wall\r\ncannot be denied, but at the same time that this occurrence, compared\r\nwith the frequency of _Ascaridæ_, should be regarded as exceedingly\r\nrare. It is another matter as to whether it is possible for the worms\r\nto penetrate an intestinal wall already diseased, especially when\r\nulcerated; a whole series of observations are in favour of this. In\r\nLini’s[652] case (fifty-six Ascarides escaped from the umbilicus of\r\na girl, aged 7), in Gräffe’s[653] (eighty Ascarides escaped from an\r\ninguinal tumour), in Nicolino’s[654] (perforation of the intestinal\r\nwall with strangulated hernia), in Liesen’s[655] (a living Ascaris\r\nin the peritoneal cavity in a woman suffering from a peritoneal\r\nabscess)--in these it is clear that disease processes in the intestine\r\npreceded the exit of the worms. In a case described by Boloff[656] the\r\nAscarides appear to have produced, by forming a tight coil, necrosis of\r\nthe gut with perforative peritonitis. In a case recorded by Lutz[657]\r\nthe perforative peritonitis was without doubt provoked by Ascaris, and\r\nin one by Schiller[658] the Ascaris had clearly gained access to the\r\nperitoneal cavity through a gunshot wound opening. In a case observed\r\nby Rehn[659] the worm probably entered through a gangrenous portion\r\nof the intestine in a hernial sac. Broca[660] is unable to determine\r\nwhether in his case the intestinal perforation was primary (a worm\r\nescaped from the abdominal wound about two months after a laparotomy\r\nfor suppurative peritonitis). The case reported by Lutz[661] is of\r\nspecial interest: it was that of a young man who had shot himself in\r\nthe region of the abdomen, and who died after fifteen days. At the\r\n_post-mortem_ two Ascarides were found in the pulmonary artery; they\r\nhad probably escaped from the intestine, and had gained access to the\r\ninferior vena cava. Froelich[662] assumes that in his case (a boy,\r\naged 11) the Oxyuris were able to penetrate the whole intestinal wall,\r\nbut Vuillemin[663] considers this improbable, and is more inclined\r\nto think that the Oxyurides penetrated the rectum at small ulcerated\r\npoints, and thus gained access to the perirectal connective tissue.\r\nIn females Oxyuris not only have the power of penetrating far into\r\nthe sexual organs (Marro[664]), and perhaps causing a parasitic\r\nendometritis (Simons[665]), but also clearly of gaining access to the\r\nperitoneal cavity by way of the tubes, as is to be assumed in the\r\ncase recorded by Kolb[666] (that of a woman, aged 42, in whom _post\r\nmortem_ nodules were found over the peritoneum of Douglas’s pouch, in\r\nwhich the pressure of encapsuled Oxyuris could be demonstrated), in\r\nthat reported by Chiari[667] (adult Oxyuris in Douglas’s pouch) and\r\nby Schneider[668] (an Oxyuris encapsuled in the pelvic peritoneum).\r\nSehrt’s[669] case is worthy of attention; in this an abscess was found\r\nin the omentum with numerous Ascaris ova in the pus and a _nodular_\r\nlesion of the peritoneum, with Ascaris ova encapsuled in the nodules.\r\nMassive accumulation of Ascarides may give rise to a complete occlusion\r\nof the gut. Such an occurrence is not so surprising as might be thought\r\nwhen one reflects that the number of Ascarides in one individual may\r\namount to several hundreds. For instance, one boy evacuated within\r\na single day 600 Ascarides (Fauconneau-Dufresne[670]) and within\r\nthree years 5,126 worms. In the case recorded by Tschernomikow[671]\r\na boy, aged 2-1/2, evacuated during a day 208 worms, partly through\r\nthe stomach, partly through the intestine. Coil-formation of such\r\nmasses of Ascarides renders possible not only constipation, but also\r\ncomplete obstruction with symptoms of ileus, as shown by the five cases\r\nquoted by Mosler and Peiper,[672] as well as from observations made by\r\nRaie,[673] Schulhof,[674] Rehberg,[675] Rocheblave,[676] Heller,[677]\r\nLeichtenstern,[678] Huber,[679] and Wilms.[680] In two cases of\r\nBlack[681] and Parkinson[682] the intestinal obstruction was caused by\r\na coil of tapeworms.\r\n\r\n[596] Strümpell, “Lehrb. d. spez.

Vivaldi and\r\nTonello found helminthes in 80 per cent. of their typhoid patients,\r\nnumbering among these _Trichocephalus dispar_, _Oxyuris vermicularis_,\r\n_Ancylostoma duodenale_, and _Ascaridæ_. The report of Leuckart[686] is\r\nhere worth citing, to the effect that Thiebault never failed to find\r\nTrichocephalus in his cholera patients at Naples. Blanchard[687] goes\r\nso far as to express the desire that in every febrile affection of the\r\nintestine an anthelmintic treatment with thymol should be undertaken as\r\nearly as possible, even before learning the results of serum diagnosis.\r\n\r\n[683] Guiart, _Compt. rend.

The\r\nproglottides are passed always united in large pieces, the ova are\r\ndeposited through the uterine pore, while the worm is still in the\r\nintestine, so that they are easily found in the fæces. The proglottides\r\nare so characteristic that they cannot be confused with those of\r\nother species. In reference to whether age or sex is spared by _D.\r\nlatus_, it is not possible to make any definite statement, especially\r\nso far as the endemic area is concerned, whether a person resides\r\nin it continuously or visits it, so long as his habit of life is in\r\naccordance with those of the country. Bendix[688] certainly emphasizes\r\nthe fact that early childhood is as a rule immune: his case was that of\r\na child, aged 4-1/2 years.\r\n\r\n[688] Bendix, _Verein f. innere Med._, Berlin, June 16, 1902.\r\n\r\n\r\nSparganum mansoni.\r\n\r\nAccording to our present knowledge (Miyake[689]) the disease occurs\r\nalmost exclusively in China and Japan. On the main island it occurs\r\nin all districts, though rarely under observation. It is especially\r\nfrequent in the neighbourhood of Kioto and Osaka; these places are very\r\nnear together, and between them there is mutually active intercourse,\r\nso that taken together they may be regarded as one district infested by\r\nthis worm disease. As regards localization in the body, there appears\r\nto exist a certain predisposition for definite regions, for instance,\r\nthe eye and genito-urinary tract. In some cases the parasite manifested\r\nthe peculiarity of wandering about the body and of appearing at certain\r\nfavourite points (musc. quadriceps femoris) (Hashimoto[690]). Most\r\npatients complain more or less of the onset of attacks of pain and\r\nof sensitiveness to pressure. In those cases in which the patients\r\nevacuated the worm during micturition, the symptoms were variable;\r\nsometimes there was tenesmus of the bladder, sometimes pains in the\r\ninguinal region, sometimes hæmaturia. None of these troubles is\r\ncharacteristic of the disease, and does no more than represent the\r\nsymptoms that follow a mechanical irritation that any kind of foreign\r\nbody may produce. Besides the onset of attacks of pain, swelling\r\nof the regions affected, if superficial, may often be recognized,\r\nwhen a superficial diffuse soft tumour can be felt which often gives\r\npseudo-fluctuation. Sometimes a peculiar crackling can be detected\r\ninternally, as in the making of a snowball. During the further course\r\nan abscess not infrequently forms around the worm. When the situation\r\nof the worm is superficial, “an inflammatory tumour with a tendency\r\nto migrate” is stated by Omi[691] to be an important diagnostic sign.\r\nThat, however, is not always the case, as the observation made by\r\nInoye[692] shows. It would be better to add to this sign the onset of\r\nparoxysmal pain and the temporary change in volume of the tumour. When\r\nonce the parasite is removed, the wound heals just as satisfactorily as\r\nany other fresh wounds made at operation.\r\n\r\n[689] Miyake, _Mitteil. aus d. Grenzgebiete_, 1904, xiii.\r\n\r\n[690] Hashimoto, quoted by Miyake.\r\n\r\n[691] Omi, _Iji-Shinshi_, Tokio, 1898.\r\n\r\n[692] Inoye, _ibid._, 1897.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Dipylidium caninum* (_Tænia cucumerina_).\r\n\r\nThis species belongs to parasites of rare occurrence. Up to the year\r\n1905 Bollinger[693] collected thirty-six cases from the literature,\r\ntwenty-nine of which were children and seven adults. Since then some\r\nfurther cases have come to light, so that the number now observed\r\namounts to ninety, and among them only eight adults. The youngest\r\nchild was 6 weeks old (Köhl[694]), in which the first proglottides\r\nwere passed when the child was 40 days old. This preponderating\r\noccurrence in children is clearly connected with the close intercourse\r\nbetween children and dogs, and also cats. Bollinger believes that _D.\r\ncaninum_ in reality occurs more frequently in adults than has hitherto\r\nbeen supposed. In addition, it must be mentioned that this species\r\nis quite unknown to many physicians, and is occasionally confused\r\nwith _Tænia solium_. One notices almost daily a large quantity of\r\ncucumber-seed-like bodies, reddish or whitish-grey, about 1 cm. long\r\nand 2 mm. broad, discharged with the stools. Lindblad[695] remarks\r\nthat these bodies have lively movements, that they perish rapidly\r\nin fresh water, and become white and smooth. These Cestodes, in\r\nisolated cases, are parasitic in the intestine in large numbers.\r\nSonnenschein[696] expelled four fragments in the case of a boy, aged\r\n4 months; Asam[697] three fragments in the case of a child, aged 19\r\nmonths; and Zschokke[698] as many as five or six in that of a boy, aged\r\n4. They do not always produce such striking symptoms as occurred in\r\nPollak’s case.[699] In other cases gastro-intestinal disturbances with\r\nor without fever (Krüger[700]), emaciation (Zschokke), or even nervous\r\nsymptoms of central origin in the form of convulsions (Brandt[701])\r\nhave been observed. From the nature and mode of infection children must\r\nbe kept from close contact with dogs and cats as much as possible to\r\nensure prophylaxis. The appropriate treatment, as it mainly affects\r\nchildren, deserves special mention, whilst the expulsion of the\r\nremaining Cestodes may be described in this connection. Among the drugs\r\none may mention flor. kousso 1·0 grm., pulpa tamar. depur. 2 grm.,\r\nsyrup of sugar 50·0 grm., one-third to be taken every hour (Lindblad).\r\nKamala appears to have no effect, although Huber[702] recommends it\r\nin small doses according to age from 0·5 to 3·0 grm. He warns against\r\n_Filix mas_ preparations, which otherwise, even in early childhood,\r\nunder careful dosage gives the best results. Young children are given\r\n1·0 to 2·0 grm. extr. fil. maris, with mint syrup or raspberry syrup\r\n30·0 grm., in the morning twice an hour by the mouth, or 1·0 grm.\r\nextr. fil. maris is mixed with syrup of mint, and given by means of a\r\nstomach tube (Rosenberg[703]). A few hours afterwards a mild laxative\r\nmay be taken--one to two tablespoonfuls of aqueous tincture of rhubarb\r\n(Asam)--or an enema may be given. In a case reported by Sonnenschein\r\ndecoction of pomegranate root had no effect, as it was vomited up.\r\n\r\n[693] Bollinger, _Deutsch. Arch. f. klin.

Not uncommonly several thousand have been found in\r\none case (Nicolo,[704] E. Stoerk and Haendel[705]). It is remarkable\r\nthat these Cestodes have been found so frequently _post mortem_ and\r\nafter vermifuges given for other reasons. Thus the clinical symptoms\r\nmust often be very indefinite (Stoerk and Haendel), so that one may\r\nassume that only a slight percentage of cases of _Hymenolepis nana_\r\ncome under observation and are published as such. On the other hand,\r\nit is certainly conceivable that with the large number of parasites\r\nthat frequently occur in one individual a whole series of symptoms,\r\nin part quite severe, are capable of being produced. These are partly\r\nsymptoms of intestinal catarrh, consisting of abdominal pains,\r\nconstipation, alternating with attacks of diarrhœa, perverse appetite,\r\nand boulimia, abdominal pains of a cramp-like nature, followed by\r\nemaciation, headache, sleeplessness, pallor, lassitude, and in part\r\nnervous symptoms--epileptiform attacks without loss of consciousness,\r\nweakness of memory, melancholia, irregular febrile attacks (Lutz[706]).\r\nPossibly, too, _Hymenolepis nana_ infects the urinary organs, producing\r\ntrue chyluria (Predtetschensky[707]). Stoerk and Haendel are inclined\r\nto think that this species, unlike other Cestodes parasitic in man\r\nand domestic animals, needs no intermediate host for its development,\r\nand that the larval forms (cysticercoid) live in the same host as the\r\nadults. The diagnosis is based on the demonstration of ova in the\r\nstools. As far as expulsion of this Cestode is concerned, santonin,\r\nkamala, kousso flowers and thymol appear to have no effect of\r\nimportance; whilst extract of male fern, recommended by Grassi[708] as\r\na result of his considerable and successful experience, has been given,\r\nwith the result that the worms really are expelled, and that after the\r\ntreatment neither worms nor ova are any longer demonstrable in the\r\nstools of patients. In his cases of chyluria Predtetschensky prescribed\r\nol. terebinth. 20 drops three times daily for a fortnight, then\r\nacid. gallic. 0·5 grm. three times a day for two days, then 1·0 grm.\r\nthree times a day; the urine became clear, but whether permanent cure\r\nresulted remained doubtful.\r\n\r\n[704] Nicolo, _Gaz. d.

Symptoms of intestinal stenosis\r\nare certainly very rare, as in the case recorded by Steinhaus[710]\r\nof a child, aged 9, the stenosis ceasing after the expulsion of the\r\nsegments. The usual position of the worm in the small intestine is with\r\nthe head closely adherent to the mucosa and the proglottides lying\r\nalong the intestine; from time to time portions are discharged with\r\nthe fæces _per rectum_. Its position can also be reversed, and the\r\nproglottides in the gut become thus discharged by vomiting.\r\n\r\n[710] Steinhaus, _Deutsch. med. Wochenschr._, 1903.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis depends upon the proglottides being generally discharged\r\nin pieces in the stools, or eventually an examination for eggs.\r\nLarval infection (_Cysticercus cellulosæ_) occurs also in man through\r\nauto-infection or through food.\r\n\r\n_Cysticercus cellulosæ_ of the skin and subcutaneous tissue occurs\r\nvery seldom singly; as a rule they are found in hundreds and thousands\r\nin the same individual. They occur in different parts of the body,\r\nespecially on the flexor surfaces of the extremities (generally\r\nsymmetrically), small globular swellings, the size of a pea or a hazel\r\nnut, smooth, of a tough cartilaginous consistence, fairly movable under\r\nthe skin, in the muscles less so. They never degenerate or cause the\r\nsurrounding skin to lose its colour. It is an interesting fact that\r\nin the case described by Posselt[711] nodules on the face, namely in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the left cheek and behind the left ear, reformed.\r\nThe following are, according to Posselt, characteristic for cutaneous\r\ntumours due to cysticerci: (1) the position in the subcutaneous\r\nconnective tissue (and almost always simultaneously in the muscles);\r\n(2) the approximately equal size and regularly rounded oval form; (3)\r\nthe peculiar density, almost reminding one of cartilage in its hardness\r\nand the sensation of tightly distended thick-walled bladders; (4)\r\nproportionately slight mobility; (5) with painlessness, absence of any\r\ncutaneous reaction (hyperæmia or swelling of the skin or pigmentation).\r\nThe very gradual appearance generally of the tumours supports the\r\ndiagnosis, and in addition to this evidence we may emphasize the\r\npreponderating liability of the upper part of the body to attack and\r\nthe symmetrical arrangement of the nodules. Cutaneous and muscular\r\ncysticerci cause the most varied symptoms, sensory disturbances,\r\nabnormal sensations, depression and a feeling of weariness whenever\r\nthe diseased parts are moved, weakness in the lower extremities,\r\npains in the course of the sciatic nerve, in addition to those which\r\nsimulate cramp in the calves, numbness in the hands, pains upon their\r\nbeing moved. In the case of a cysticercus situated in the elbow-joint,\r\npainful dragging sensation in the course of the ulnar nerve persisted.\r\nIn other cases the arm was almost paralysed, or it could not be\r\ncompletely extended; stiffness and bending of the little finger were\r\nnoticed. Cysticerci of the gluteal muscle cause trouble upon sitting\r\nand upon defæcation. Remittent unilateral headaches were present in\r\nthe case of a cysticercus of the region of the right eyebrow; pains of\r\na neuralgic character radiated from the diseased temporal region. The\r\ncysts may be inflamed and may suppurate; this especially happens in the\r\ncase of solitary cutaneous and muscle cysticerci. The best treatment\r\nconsists in puncture of the cysts with a Pravaz syringe and subsequent\r\ninjection of a drop of 1 per cent. sublimate solution. Tincture of\r\niodine has similarly been proposed (Wolff[712]). Frangenheim[713]\r\nrecommends early extirpation (this, however, only in the case of\r\nsolitary cysts). Pelagutti[714] believes that in his case diminution\r\nin the size of the cysts was obtained by the use of anthelminthic\r\nremedies continued over a long period combined with potassium iodide\r\nand calcium salts (internally). Cysticercus is very rarely found in\r\nthe tongue; there the worms generally lie in front of the sulcus\r\nterminalis, corresponding to the middle of the tongue, according to\r\nGlas.[715] In the case recorded by Gaetano[716] (a boy, aged 10) there\r\nwas a nodule on the left side of the tongue which grew very rapidly\r\ntill it reached the size of a nut; it was embedded in the muscle and\r\ncovered over by normal mucosa. Cysticerci are just as rare in the\r\npleuræ, in the lungs, in the intestinal submucosa, in the submucosa\r\nof the small intestine, in the mesenteric glands, in the liver,\r\npancreas, spleen and kidneys, in the mamma, in the heart, in the bones\r\nand in the great vessels (Huber[717]). Cysticercus of the eye deserves\r\nspecial mention; in rare cases the cysticercus has been met with in the\r\nsubcutaneous cellular tissue of the eyelid, once in the muscle bundles\r\nof the musculus orbicularis. Subconjunctival cysts are found chiefly\r\nin youthful individuals. Their position is most varied, generally in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the inner angle of the eye. Dilated vessels pass\r\nright over the cysts, which are generally movable, together with the\r\nbase they rest upon, producing a spherical protrusion. The head of the\r\nworm can sometimes be seen shining through as a whitish speck. The only\r\nsymptoms are those of a slight irritation of the connective tissue and\r\nsome difficulty in closing the lid; larger cysts dislocate the globe.\r\nThe diagnosis has the rapid growth of the cystic tumour to support\r\nit; there is the possibility of its being mistaken for a foreign body\r\n(Kaldrovils[718]). After division of the connective tissue capsule\r\nextraction is easily performed. It is most rare for the cysticercus\r\nto occur in the orbit. Suppuration of the cyst may have serious\r\nconsequences for the eye. It is only exceptionally that the cysticerci\r\ngain access to the anterior chamber of the eye.\r\n\r\n[711] Posselt, _Wien. klin. Wochenschr._, 1899.\r\n\r\n[712] Wolff, “Lesser’s Encyclop. d. Haut- u. Geschlechtskrankh.,” 1900.\r\n\r\n[713] Frangenheim, _Volkm. klin. Vortr._, No. 424.\r\n\r\n[714] Pelagutti, _Giorn. ital. delle mal. vener._, 1900.\r\n\r\n[715] Glas, _Wien. klin.

Wochenschr._, 1902.\r\n\r\nSubretinal cysticerci or those localized in the vitreous are more\r\nfrequent. Upon examination with the ophthalmoscope there is seen in the\r\nvitreous a bluish bladder with a smooth surface. The head is seen as\r\na white patch, and the circle of hooks and the suckers also come into\r\nview, also the frequent movements which the head and neck make in the\r\nvitreous. Operation generally yields good results; in rare instances\r\nthe globe is atrophied and must be enucleated.\r\n\r\nFormerly cysticerci in the brain were met with in fair frequency, but\r\nthe number of such cases has generally decreased of late years in a\r\nremarkable way, in correspondence with the diminution of cysticerci,\r\nwhich is to be attributed to compulsory meat inspection. Whilst, for\r\nexample, the _post-mortem_ records of the Pathological Institute in\r\nBerlin before the year 1875 showed 20 per cent. cysticerci affecting\r\nthe brain, this number declined later to 16·3 per cent., and of late\r\nyears has fallen to 1 per cent. (Orth[719]). Nevertheless even now\r\ncysticercus still plays no inconsiderable part in the etiology of\r\ncerebral diseases. For example, in the clinic of de Amicis at Naples,\r\namong seven cases of cysticerci of the skin, they were found four\r\ntimes also in the brain (Sipari[720]). Cysticerci may occur in the\r\ndura mater, arachnoid, pia mater, choroid plexus, the surface of\r\nthe cerebral hemisphere, the medullary substance, the ventricles,\r\nthe aqueduct, the corpus striatum, corpora quadrigemina, the pineal\r\ngland, the pons, the cerebellum, the olfactory trigone, the bulb, the\r\nmedulla oblongata, and the olive. They are most frequently found in the\r\ncortical substance and in the ventricles; the frequency of the latter\r\nsituation may be explained by the flow of the fluid (Henneberg[721]).\r\nThe severity of the symptoms is not always in proportion to the number\r\nof cysticerci. Cases have been known in which ten, twenty and forty\r\ncysticerci have been found (Hagen-Thorn[722]), and yet the clinical\r\nsymptoms have been remarkably slight. On the other hand, solitary cysts\r\nmay both run a course completely without symptoms and also cause the\r\nseverest symptoms when located in specially important parts of the\r\nbrain (crus, pons, central convolutions). In the case mentioned by\r\nJacobson[723] the invasion of the brain by cysticerci was immense; the\r\nlargest cyst was found in the cerebral cortex. The chief symptoms of\r\ncysticercus of the brain substance consist in the onset of cortical\r\nepilepsy, which sometimes runs a very pernicious course, frequently\r\nwith psychical disturbances, whilst paralyses are absent. Perhaps, too,\r\nthe localization of pain, spontaneous and on pressure, corresponding\r\nwith the points observed on the cranium, is of importance. Cysticerci\r\nmay also change their position in the brain; patients who had earlier\r\nsuffered from epileptiform convulsions later showed intra-ocular\r\ncysticerci after the cerebral symptoms had completely disappeared.\r\nTreatment can only be surgical; v. Bergmann[724] operated in two\r\ncases with well-marked improvement. Parasites in the ventricles are\r\nespecially dangerous, more especially so when free in the ventricles,\r\nand so capable of giving rise to the danger of sudden closure of\r\nthe foramen of Majendie (Simmonds,[725] Versé[726]). Stern[727]\r\nstates the symptoms of cysticercus in the fourth ventricle to be the\r\nfollowing: general cerebral pressure symptoms (headache, vertigo,\r\nvomiting, somnolence, congested disc caused by internal hydrocephalus);\r\nin addition, there are symptoms which point to disease of the\r\nhind-brain--pain and stiffness in the neck, vertigo and cerebellar\r\nataxy, violent and persistent vomiting, slowness of pulse; and lastly\r\nthose rare but certain symptoms of a lesion of the bulb, such as\r\ndiabetes, respiratory disturbances and paralysis of cerebral nerves,\r\nespecially of the abducens. These are far less marked than the general\r\nsymptoms of cerebral pressure. One characteristic is the remarkable\r\nalternation between severe general symptoms and periods of complete\r\nsense of well-being; in this way a functional nervous affection may\r\nbe simulated (Jolasse[728]). Brun’s symptom (in the widest sense,\r\nsudden onset of violent cerebral symptoms upon change of head-posture)\r\nis a specially characteristic sign of free cysticercus in the fourth\r\nventricle; the disease generally terminates with sudden death from\r\ncessation of the heart’s action. Defects in motor power, convulsions,\r\nimplication of other nerves, are rare and unessential complications\r\n(Hartmann[729]). Carefully carried out, lumbar puncture may possess\r\nsome diagnostic and therapeutic value. Treatment is purely symptomatic,\r\nor eventually Neisser’s ventricle puncture may be considered.\r\n\r\n[719] Orth, _Berl. med.

In the case recorded\r\nby Meyer[730] symptoms which resembled paralysis agitans were\r\nnoteworthy, and defects in speech in the case recorded by Durst[731]\r\n(_C. racemosus_ in the region of the left Sylvian fossa). According\r\nto Markwald[732] _C. racemosus_ of the fourth ventricle is said to\r\nrepresent a characteristic clinical picture: violent headaches,\r\nattacks of vertigo followed very soon by deep coma and death in a few\r\ndays. Treatment in _Cysticercus racemosus_ is ineffectual. In the\r\ndiagnosis of cerebral cysticerci in general the recognition of multiple\r\ncysticerci in the skin and muscle and of the tapeworm is of importance.\r\nIn cases of cerebral diseases in which cysticerci may be a possible\r\ncause, Remmert[733] recommends that the skin of the whole body should\r\nbe palpated.\r\n\r\n[730] Meyer, _Deutsch. med.

Berlin,” 1893.\r\n\r\nCysticercus in the spinal cord and in the vertebral column is\r\noccasionally observed; as a rule, other organs, above all the brain and\r\nits membranes, are simultaneously affected. Here, too, the cysticercus\r\noccurs in two forms--sometimes the cysts are roundish or oval, solitary\r\nor multiple, and at other times _Cysticercus racemosus_ occurs.\r\n\r\n\r\nTænia saginata.\r\n\r\nOccurs in the small intestine of man. It is characteristic of the\r\nhabit of life of this parasite that once it has become mature its\r\nproglottides are dropped off daily in increasing numbers because its\r\ngrowth is extraordinarily rapid. The joints are discharged generally\r\nspontaneously during the whole day without a stool. An extraordinarily\r\nunpleasant sensation is produced by the damp, cool joints slipping\r\ndown into one’s lower garments and over one’s legs when walking; women\r\nespecially, in whom the proglottides slip through their petticoats on\r\nto their legs, complain bitterly of this troublesome symptom. Another\r\nunpleasant symptom is superadded in the shape of the proglottides\r\ntickling the rectum, and this excites irritable people to the last\r\ndegree. Different species of tapeworms are not mutually exclusive.\r\n_B. latus_ and _T. solium_ frequently occur side by side, so also _T.\r\nsolium_ and _T. saginata_--for instance, in a butcher’s assistant we\r\nonce expelled twelve _T. solium_ and one _T. saginata_ at the same\r\ntime. The greatest number of Tæniæ which have been observed at one\r\ntime amounted to forty _T. solium_ (Kleefeld[734]). Even though the\r\ncysticercus of _T. saginata_ is not, as in the case of _T. solium_,\r\nparticularly dangerous to man, a parasite, nevertheless, which requires\r\nso much nutrient material during its rapid growth, and thereby sets up\r\nmanifold disturbances in the general condition of health, ought to be\r\nexpelled as rapidly and thoroughly as possible.\r\n\r\n[734] Kleefeld, _see_ Seifert _loc. cit._\r\n\r\nTapeworms are found not uncommonly with other intestinal parasites,\r\nsuch as Ascaris, Oxyuris, Trichocephalus or Ancylostoma. Prunac[735]\r\ndescribed a case in which a woman passed a Tænia through the anus while\r\nshe vomited a _Fasciola hepatica_.\r\n\r\n[735] Prunac, _see_ Eichhorst, “Handb. d. spez. Path. u. Therap.,” ii,\r\np. 281.\r\n\r\nThe symptomatology of these three large species of Cestodes,\r\n_Dibothriocephalus latus_, _Tænia solium_, and _T. saginata_, may\r\nvery well be summarized together, as, apart from some peculiarities,\r\nthe clinical symptoms, especially so far as their localization in the\r\nintestine is concerned, are practically the same for all three species.\r\nIn a large number of cases the hosts have no suspicion whatever that\r\nthey are harbouring a tapeworm; they feel quite well and free from any\r\ndisquieting symptoms whatever, and only become aware of the fact that\r\nthey are the carriers of a tapeworm when the discharge of the segments\r\ntakes place; on the other hand, it is often difficult to rid people\r\nof the idea that they are harbouring a Tænia (Küchenmeister calls\r\nsuch _Tænia imaginata_); usually it is undigested fibrous shreds of\r\nbeefsteak which are regarded by the patients as proglottides of tæniæ.\r\n\r\nIn a large number of cases, disturbances of the intestinal tract set\r\nin, _e.g._, sense of pressure in the abdomen, which sometimes becomes\r\nconstant on one and the same side, or sometimes changes, now at the\r\numbilicus and again at the epigastrium; here and there colicky pains\r\nare present. Derangements of appetite and digestion are frequently\r\ncomplained of; the most frequent are the sensations of morbid hunger or\r\nirregular appetite, nausea and vomiting. Thus, at the Third Congress\r\nof Internal Medicine, Senator recorded a case in which there were\r\nsymptoms of nervous dyspepsia, cured after a successful vermifuge.\r\nThere is either constipation or diarrhœa, so that many of such patients\r\nare brought for treatment with the diagnosis of “chronic intestinal\r\ncatarrh” and correspondingly treated. As to the treatment of toxic\r\naction of the Tæniæ when such arises, _see_ the special section on the\r\nsubject (bothriocephalus anæmia, p. 644). The frequent disturbances of\r\nthe general condition, so-called reflex phenomena, so far as the action\r\nof toxic substances is not in question, may be explained by the fact of\r\ntheir occurrence in specially sensitive individuals who are affected\r\nby such phenomena. The proof that a diseased condition is produced by\r\na tapeworm will be forthcoming with some degree of certainty if the\r\nsymptoms cease immediately after the removal of the parasites. As a\r\nwhole series of troubles, which certainly have nothing to do with them,\r\nare erroneously ascribed to the tapeworm, as is frequently assumed, one\r\nwill do well to be somewhat critical in this respect.\r\n\r\nThe treatment is of a threefold nature: prophylactic, symptomatic and\r\nradical.\r\n\r\nUnder any circumstances, the best prophylaxis is that which consists\r\nin only eating the flesh of those animals in which any of the three\r\nlarval forms occur (pig, cattle, salmon, pike, burbot, etc.) so\r\nprepared that the larval forms have been destroyed and the food thus\r\nrendered innocuous. For domestic and public use the rule prescribed by\r\nKüchenmeister is under all circumstances most easily understood, namely\r\nto roast or boil till the flesh appear greyish-white and sufficiently\r\ndone by reason of the coagulation of the albumen and decolorization\r\nof the blood. The general prophylaxis simply concerns the tapeworm\r\ncarriers trying to limit as far as possible the further extension of\r\nthe parasites in the animal world by carefully rendering the expelled\r\nsegments and worms harmless (pouring sulphuric acid over the fæces\r\nand burning the worms) and also by strictly adhering to official\r\nregulations. The official system of meat inspection in this respect\r\nhas been of immense service, and much can still be done by means of\r\nthorough official control over cleanliness in abattoirs and butchers’\r\nshops. Galli-Valerio[736] very rightly desires the abolition of the\r\ncustom of manuring fruit-plants such as strawberries, vegetables and\r\nsalad with the contents of privies, and would extend the use of privies\r\nin the country.\r\n\r\n[736] Galli-Valerio, _Therap. Monatsh._, 1900.\r\n\r\nSymptomatic treatment consists, in the case of those Tæniæ which resist\r\nradical attempts at expulsion, of repeated use of drugs injurious to\r\nthe worm as soon as ever new proglottides are formed, or in special\r\ncases, as in the case of persons weakened by diseases or operations,\r\nor frail old people, or patients with severe heart failure, gastric or\r\nintestinal carcinoma, or in pregnancy, in effecting the expulsion of a\r\nlarge chain of proglottides by the mildest measures possible.\r\n\r\nRadical treatment of the Tænia is not always equally easy in all three\r\nspecies, even when the means used are the same; the easiest to expel\r\nis _T. solium_, then _D. latus_, and the most difficult _T. saginata_.\r\nThat as yet no certain cure exists for Cestodes is clear from the large\r\nnumber of drugs recommended from time to time, and the increase of\r\nbungling treatment in this respect; in addition, there is no department\r\nin which there is so much quackery as in vermifuges. The treatment\r\nproper should always be preceded by thorough preparatory treatment,\r\nthe purpose of which is to render the gut as empty as possible once\r\nfor all, and on the other hand to put the worms themselves into a\r\ndiseased condition. How far the host himself has been made ill by\r\nsuch preliminary cures (herring, pickle, garlic, onions, preserved\r\nstrawberries), many a person who has had to do with such things can\r\nrecount. In the opinion of Fischer[737] strict preparatory treatment\r\nappears to favour the development of toxic substances, or else it\r\ndisposes to vomiting; as a rule it causes the patient far more\r\ndiscomfort than the treatment itself. In recent times far less weight\r\nis attached to these preparatory treatments than to carefully prepared\r\nand correctly dosed drugs; the preparation is generally limited to\r\nrelieving the intestine in a simple way, the day before the treatment,\r\nof the densest fæcal masses, by a simple aperient or water enema.\r\n\r\n[737] Fischer, Stockholm, Nordin and Josephson, 1904.\r\n\r\nWe recommend the following, which has always proved itself to be the\r\nbest and simplest remedy against _T. saginata_. The patient takes\r\nearly in the evening before the treatment nothing but a plate of soup\r\nor a glass of milk, and then takes a laxative (electuar. lenit or\r\ninfus. sennæ compos. or an enema), so that later in the evening one\r\nto two stools are passed. In this connection we fail to agree with\r\nGrawitz[738] and Boas,[739] who consider that at least preliminary\r\nevacuation of the intestines can be dispensed with. On the following\r\nmorning the patient should take a cup of black coffee or tea without\r\nanything else, and half an hour later the vermifuge.\r\n\r\n[738] Grawitz, _Münch. med. Wochenschr._, 1899.\r\n\r\n[739] Boas, _Deutsch. med. Wochenschr._, 1889.\r\n\r\nThe best drug is extract. filicis maris æther., which also forms\r\nthe main constituent of most of the secret remedies recommended for\r\ntapeworms. Earlier mishaps with this preparation had their origin\r\nprincipally in insufficient dosage. Also, in addition to correct\r\ndosage, extract. filic. maris needs very careful preparation if\r\nsatisfactory results are to be attained. If preparations with the trade\r\nmark “Helfenberg” or “Wohnar” are not used, but the male fern extract\r\nhas been prepared by a chemist, one must make certain that the roots\r\nof the _Aspidium filix-mas_ have been collected in May or October, and\r\nonly green sappy specimens selected, and that the attached paleæ have\r\nbeen separated, that they have been broken up small and ether poured\r\nover them with a little spirits of wine while quite fresh. The whole\r\nmass is to be kept in a cool place, but not too closely covered. If\r\nat any time a certain quantity is to be used, it is taken out, the\r\nether carefully distilled in a retort till the extract has a suitable\r\nfluid consistency. Fischer attaches great importance to the direction\r\nin the Pharmacopœia being exactly followed, to the effect that the\r\nextract is to be carefully stirred before prescribing, as the active\r\nsubstances undergo partial crystallization if kept for any length of\r\ntime and sink to the bottom, so that the preparation has a different\r\nstrength and toxicity in different layers. Of this extract 10 to 12\r\nto 15 grm. are to be taken in gelatine capsules within half an hour.\r\nWe consider it unjustifiable to give greater doses than 15 grm. to\r\nadults, as many cases are known in which to some extent severe toxic\r\nsymptoms have followed, such as headache, sensation of giddiness,\r\ndyspnœa and cyanosis, yellow vision (xanthopsia), delirium, stupor,\r\nthe most severe cramps in the extremities, rapidly fatal trismus and\r\ntetanus. The most serious are defects of vision of various kinds,\r\nwhich may end in amblyopia and amaurosis, with permanent blindness. A\r\ncomplete collection of toxicological literature up to the year 1903\r\nis to be found in Marx’s[740] Dissertation. Since that time further\r\ninstances of such intoxications have been made known. Nagel[741]\r\nobserved them only in severe cases. O. Meyer[742] lays special\r\nstress on the bad prognosis of the disturbances of vision evoked by\r\npoisoning with extract. filicis maris. Studt[742] has seen two cases\r\nof optic neuritis, one with circumscribed, the other with diffuse\r\nretinal œdema. Uhthoff[743] has only seen one case; in that reported\r\nby Noiszewski[744] the toxic retinitis was cured; in Viereck’s[745]\r\ncase bilateral concentric limitation of the field of vision followed\r\nthree days after taking 8·0 grm. extract. filicis maris. Stuelp[746]\r\nattributes the amaurosis occurring after taking filix mas to a toxic\r\naction on the muscularis of the central retinal artery; there followed\r\nparalysis of the vessel, vascular engorgement, and thereby nutritional\r\ndefects of the nervous elements followed. In children one has to\r\ndiminish the dose correspondingly, as with them, still more so than\r\nwith adults, severe disturbances arise. Huber[747] claims that this\r\ndrug should not be given to children indiscriminately. The view is\r\nfrequently expressed that a combination of extractum filicis maris\r\nwith fatty oils in which the active constituents are soluble favours\r\nintoxication. Marx[748] also argues from this standpoint and assumes\r\nthat the ideal preparation, free from objection, would be got if from\r\nfilix-mas extract a preparation free from fatty oils could be made, and\r\nhe considers it advisable to limit the use of castor oil as an aperient\r\nbefore and after taking the “cure” and to prescribe instead a saline\r\nlaxative, such as Epsom salts or Glauber’s salts. Sonnenschein[749]\r\nalso advises against the simultaneous exhibition of extractum filicis\r\nmaris with oleum ricini, as is the case with Helfenberg’s capsules,\r\nand Boas[750] is likewise anxious that ol. ricini should be avoided.\r\nLenhartz[751] appears to consider the warning against the simultaneous\r\ncombination of the extract with fats or ethereal oils, and especially\r\nagainst the employment of castor oil as an after-treatment, as without\r\njustification, and we, too, in the course of our many filix treatments,\r\nhave never yet witnessed any unfavourable effect from the use of\r\ncastor oil in the after-treatment. The surest way of obviating the\r\ntoxic effects of extractum filicis is to give a laxative (ol. ricini)\r\nas soon as the extract has left the stomach, say, about half an hour,\r\nso that it need not stay longer than necessary in the gut and become\r\nabsorbed. Perhaps in most cases of poisoning, transgressions against\r\nthis rule have been the cause of the toxic action. The nausea that\r\nsets in the day after taking the drug and the inclination to vomit are\r\nbest resisted by giving iced coffee, iced tea, iced pills, peppermint\r\ntea, cognac, one to two wafer powders of menthol and sacch. lactis\r\nāā 0·2 grm. (Apolant[752]) half an hour before the drug is taken.\r\nFischer[753] considers that lying still in the horizontal position is\r\nthe best remedy. Boas[754] recommends the injection of the drug into\r\nthe stomachs of patients who tolerate extractum filicis badly, in the\r\nform of a thin emulsion (with gi. arab.). In the case of children\r\nthe extract is prescribed with honey as an electuary. The method\r\nrecommended by Fowler[755] is without doubt too detailed; he prescribes\r\nbefore the treatment two to three to four days’ rest in bed; special\r\ndiet, tablets of cascara sagrada three times daily, on the fourth\r\nday senna infusion, and then to give the extractum filicis maris in\r\ncapsules in four doses, to be taken every quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\n[740] Marx, “Diss.

As a vermifuge\r\nthe drug is prescribed for children of 2 to 5 years of age in doses up\r\nto 0·2 to 0·3 grm., for children of from 8 to 12 years in doses up to\r\n0·5 to 0·7 grm., and for adults up to 0·7 to 1·0 grm., so as to expel\r\nthe parasites. Bodenstein[758] gives the filmaron oil introduced into\r\ncommerce by the firm of Boehringer (one part filmaron and nine parts\r\ncastor oil) in still greater dosage, either fasting or, in the case of\r\nsensitive patients, one hour after a cup of tea; he gives peppermint\r\ntablets against possible nausea. Brieger[759] tested the preparation\r\nin twenty-three cases; in twenty-one of these he prescribed it as an\r\nether-castor oil mixture, and in two as capsules. The action always\r\ntook effect in from two to five hours, and only in three cases were\r\nunpleasant after-effects in the shape of colic observed; in sixteen\r\ncases the result was positive, in seven negative.\r\n\r\n[757] Jaquet, _Therap.

Gegenwart.,” 1905.\r\n\r\nThe attempts made by Goldmann[760] to prepare from the bark of _Musenna\r\nabyssinica_, a plant of the order _Myrsinaceæ_, indigenous to Persia,\r\nthe active substance, namely sebirol, have shown that when this is\r\ngiven alone it certainly acts as a vermicide, but not as a vermifuge;\r\non the other hand, the results of a combination of sebirol with\r\nthymol and salicylates were surprisingly good; this mixture has been\r\nintroduced into commerce as tæniol, in the shape of pastilles prepared\r\nwith chocolate for children. The method of giving tæniol is as follows:\r\nOn the day before the administration a light diet and thorough purging\r\nwith calomel are ordered; and then on the day of the treatment itself,\r\nafter a breakfast consisting of a cup of tea, in the case of adults,\r\nthirteen to fifteen tæniol pastilles are taken in some red wine at\r\nintervals of ten minutes respectively. In the middle of this treatment\r\nan interval of some hours is interposed. After the pastilles have\r\nbeen taken a calomel purge is again given. The results obtained by\r\nLiermberger[761] are sufficiently encouraging to be put to further test.\r\n\r\n[760] Goldmann, _Wien. klin. Wochenschr._, 1905.\r\n\r\n[761] Liermberger, _Berl. klin. Wochenschr._, 1905.\r\n\r\nFischer[762] has tested in some of his cases extracts of some new\r\nspecies of fern root; he employed the extract from the rhizomes of\r\n_Aspidium spinulosum_ and _A. dilatatum_, two fern roots indigenous to\r\nSweden, and obtained remarkable results (doses of 4 grm.). Laurén[763]\r\nhad previously recorded similar results, and recently Friedjung,[764]\r\nusing extr. aspid. spinulos.\r\n\r\n[762] Fischer, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\n[763] Laurén, _Therap. Monatsh._, 1899.\r\n\r\n[764] Friedjung, _Ges. f. innere Med._, Wien, March 8, 1906.\r\n\r\nCortex radicis granati as fresh bark is a very good drug, and is\r\nusually given as a decoction: 180·0 bark to 1,000·0 water, boiled\r\nfor forty hours to 240·0, and a small cupful to be given every\r\nhalf an hour; colic, vomiting and diarrhœa, are, however, easily\r\ninduced. The chief constituent of the granate root, pelletierinum,\r\npossesses vermicidal properties, and is much recommended, especially\r\nin France. Sequelæ easily arise (vertigo, hazy vision, malaise,\r\nvomiting, quickened heart’s action, muscular tremors, cramps in the\r\ncalves), especially in delicate persons and children, so that one\r\nshould refrain from giving it to the latter especially (Drivon[765]).\r\nSometimes, judging by the experience of Sobotta[766] and Boas,[767]\r\nthe action is problematical. Where it is desired to employ it in the\r\ncase of adults, the following is prescribed: pellet. sulfur. 0·3 to\r\n0·4 grm., acid. tannic. 0·5 grm., sir. rub. jd. 30·0 grm., to be taken\r\nat one time, and a quarter to half an hour after a purgative (senna\r\ninfusion). In the case of children it is better to employ semina\r\ncucurbitæ maximæ instead of extractum filicis maris. Sixty to 100\r\npumpkin seeds are pounded up with sugar, which yield a pleasant-tasting\r\nelectuary, and which are taken all at once; half an hour afterwards a\r\nlaxative is taken (Storch,[768] Pick[769]), Jungklauss’s preparation\r\nis nothing else than a pumpkin extract; its action is favourable;\r\nit is, however, too expensive (Ritter[770]). Flores kousso up to 15\r\nto 20 grm. in compressed form or in sugar or honey in the form of\r\nelectuaries (children 2·0 to 10·0 grm. according to age) is not to be\r\nrelied upon; kussin, prepared from kousso flowers (Bedall, Munich),\r\nis not a pure body; when taken it is divided into four parts up to\r\n1·0 to 2·0 grm. with elæosaccharum menthæ, at half-hourly intervals;\r\nit is said to be less unpleasant than treatment with flores kousso\r\n(Liebreich and Langgard[771]). Kosinum crystallisatum (dose 1·5 to\r\n2·0 grm.) is prepared by the firm of Merck. Kamala is the least potent\r\nof the tapeworm drugs in use, and is principally to be recommended in\r\nthe treatment of children: 1·5 to 3·0 grm. in electuaries. According\r\nto Leichtenstern[772] and White[773] chloroform, even in toxic\r\ndoses, cannot do any harm to the tapeworm, nevertheless it has been\r\nrecently recommended by Carratú[774]; chloroform 6·0, sirup. 60·0, one\r\nteaspoonful to be taken every hour (fasting). Salol is recommended by\r\nGalli-Valerio[775] as an absolutely harmless tapeworm drug; thymotal (a\r\nderivative of thymol) by Pool,[776] 3 grm. to be given up to three to\r\nfour times on four consecutive days.\r\n\r\n[765] Drivon, _Lyon méd._, 1902.\r\n\r\n[766] Sobotta, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\n[767] Boas, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\n[768] Storch, _see_ Lenhartz, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\n[769] Pick, _Ges. f. innere Med._, Wien, March 8, 1906.\r\n\r\n[770] Ritter, _Prag. med._ Wochenschr., 1904, v.\r\n\r\n[771] Liebreich and Langgard, “Kompendium der Arzneiverordnung,” 1907.\r\n\r\n[772] Leichtenstern, “Therap. der Gegenwart.,” 1899.\r\n\r\n[773] White, _Scot.

The coconut is absolutely\r\nineffectual, also naphthalin, croton-chloral, ether, gallanol,\r\nstrontium lactate, glycerine and bromide of potash.\r\n\r\n[777] Dörr, “Therap. der Gegenwart.,” 1901.\r\n\r\n[778] Koch, _Med.

In Seifert’s[779] observation, on what\r\nLeichtenstern[780] called the celebrated Würzburg case, the patient\r\nhad suffered many times from attacks of blood-stained diarrhœa with\r\ntenesmus, as in Zinn’s[781] case of a three year old boy who had bloody\r\npurulent diarrhœa. Schlüter[782] speaks of a hæmorrhagic enteritis\r\nproduced by Strongyloides. In other cases besides diarrhœa (either\r\nwith or without blood) there were noted: pains in the body (Schlüter),\r\ntenderness of the abdomen, loss of appetite, gastric troubles of\r\na general kind, headache, giddiness, fainting attacks, anæmia\r\n(Silvestri,[783] Valdes,[784] and Trappe[785]), so that even if in\r\nisolated cases (Fülleborn[786]) symptoms are absent, some significance\r\ncannot be denied these parasites as a matter of course (Bruns,[787]\r\nLeichtenstern[788]). According to Kurlow,[789] in Siberia there is a\r\nform of sporadic bloody diarrhœa which has its origin in the presence\r\nof _Strongyloides stercoralis_. The parasite does not live only in the\r\nintestinal lumen, but also in the intestinal wall, where it causes\r\nabscesses, fistulæ and effusions of blood.\r\n\r\n[779] Seifert, “Sitzungsberichte der phys.-med.

Authors differ as to the effectiveness\r\nof extr. fil. maris. Goldmann[790] still considers this preparation\r\nas the most effective; he recommends preliminary treatment with\r\ncalomel 0·2 grm. and tuber. jalapæ 0·5 grm. a day before the special\r\ntreatment, which consists of gelatine capsules of 15·0 grm. extr.\r\nfil. maris (to be taken in the course of four hours); afterwards\r\nrectified oil of turpentine in gelatine capsules. The thymol treatment\r\n(_vide_ Ancylostomiasis, p. 682), thymol alone or in combination with\r\ncalomel (Schlüter,[791] Valdes,[792] Soussino,[793] Goldmann[794]),\r\nhas often caused diminution of the number of larvæ, but also often\r\nremains resultless. Teissier[795] maintains that by degrees he procured\r\ncomplete cure by the administration of mercury in the form of blue\r\npill. In our case neither thymol nor calomel, santonin, extr. fil.\r\nmaris, decoct, rad. granat., had any result whatever. Davaine[796]\r\nbelieves he attained decrease and final disappearance of the larvæ\r\nby protracted milk-cure. Santonin, tannalbin and other preparations\r\nseem ineffectual. Tannin enemata (Mildner[797]), high injections with\r\nstarch enemata (Schlüter[798]), may alleviate in persistent diarrhœa.\r\nTravellers who are visiting regions the native home of Strongyloides\r\nmust exercise the most extreme care and scrupulous cleanliness,\r\nand these are also necessary in patients already suffering from\r\nStrongyloides, to prevent auto-reinfection (Trappe[799]).\r\n\r\n[790] Goldmann, _Deutsch.

In most cases there is\r\nonly one worm and one abscess, but here and there one finds patients\r\nwith three, four or even up to eight worms, and very exceptionally\r\nstill more, as in the cases described by Poupée-Desportes[800] (fifty\r\nworms) and by Harington[801] (seventeen worms).\r\n\r\n[800] Poupée-Desportes, _see_ Looss, “Handb. d. Tropenkrankh.,” 1905, i.\r\n\r\n[801] Harington, _Brit. Med. Journ._, 1906.\r\n\r\nDiagnosis offers no difficulty when the worms are presenting or can be\r\nfelt under the skin.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the native home of the guinea worm, as a rule,\r\nquietly wait till it has got so far out that it can be conveniently\r\ngrasped; it is then bound round with thread and fastened between the\r\ntips of a split piece of wood and slowly wound out. In ten to twelve\r\ndays it can be wound out in this way. Emily[802] makes injections of\r\na 1 in 1,000 solution of sublimate either in the neighbourhood of the\r\nworm or directly into its body. Mense[803] managed to remove the worm\r\nin one sitting by laying a wad of cotton wool soaked in chloroform on\r\nthe exposed portion, thus stupefying it. Our therapeutic observations\r\n(Frangenheim[804]) favour the free laying open of the existing abscess\r\nand the consequent complete extraction of the worm.\r\n\r\n[802] Emily, _see_ Looss _loc. cit._\r\n\r\n[803] Mense, _ibid._\r\n\r\n[804] Frangenheim, _Volkmann’s Samml. klin.

The lymphatics become hard, knotty and extremely painful, the\r\noverlying skin red and swollen in longitudinal lines (Looss), high\r\nfever sets in with, to some extent, severe general disturbance. After\r\nsome days the attack subsides, the swelling then partially disappears,\r\nbut not completely, and often abscesses develop in consequence of\r\nthe lymphangitis. Children, as a rule, suffer from such lymphangitic\r\nattacks (Finucane[805]).\r\n\r\n[805] Finucane, _Lancet_, 1907.\r\n\r\nDiagnosis is not easy, for many other causes frequently produce\r\nlymphangitis.\r\n\r\nTreatment consists in rest, raising the affected limb, applications of\r\nvinegar and alum or liquor plumbi, in some cases incisions into the\r\nswollen part under antiseptic precautions.\r\n\r\n_Elephantiasis_ (_Arabian_) is usually situated in the lower\r\nextremities, in men in the scrotum and penis, in women in the labium\r\npudendi, mons veneris, and the mammæ; more rarely it attacks the upper\r\nextremities or, indeed, the head. The disease develops during repeated\r\nattacks, which occur at irregular intervals of weeks, months or years,\r\nof fever accompanied by symptoms of lymphangitis and erysipelas\r\n(_elephantoid_ fever), and especially as the result of different\r\naccidental occurrences such as chills, bodily exertions, external\r\nirritation. The extremities become shapeless, heavy cylinders, the\r\nscrotum occasionally a colossal tumour, the female genitalia and the\r\nmammæ smaller or larger tumours; the penis often shares in the general\r\nthickening, the inguinal glands form large hard prominent masses, and\r\nenormous deformity is caused. The cause is more often seen in men than\r\nwomen, rarely in children over 10, never in younger children.\r\n\r\nTreatment of elephantiasis of the extremities consists in raising the\r\naffected part, massage, bandaging, vapour baths; the large elephantoid\r\ntumours of the genitalia and mammæ can only be treated by operative\r\nremoval.\r\n\r\nChyluria (hæmato-chyluria), as a rule, begins by a series of attacks\r\nand often ceases for weeks or months, the attacks being accompanied by\r\nfever, pain in the back and lumbar region, about the kidneys and in the\r\nperinæum. The attacks are separated by intervals of months’ or even\r\nyears’ duration, a continuous chyluria being quite rare. The disease\r\nmay last many years without the constitution being markedly weakened,\r\nbut in other cases anæmia and debility ensue and result in death from\r\nmarasmus. In chyluria the urine becomes completely opaque like milk;\r\nbut sometimes, from the presence of blood, is of a peach-like redness:\r\nthe sediment contains clotted blood, and microscopically one finds\r\nfine dust-like fat granules and red cells and leucocytes, and usually,\r\nbut not always, filaria larvæ. Sclerodermia may possibly be caused by\r\nFilaria (Bancroft[806]).\r\n\r\n[806] Bancroft, _Lancet_, 1885.\r\n\r\nTreatment, consists in administration of ol. santali, methylene blue\r\n(0·12 grm. dose several times daily), ichthyol (in pills from 0·5 to\r\n1·5 grm. per day), ol. terebinthinæ (0·5 to 1·5 gr. per day), thymol\r\n(Ziemann[807] had no result from either thymol or methylene blue),\r\ntogether with absolute rest in bed, diminution of all fatty nourishment\r\nand administration of light purgatives.\r\n\r\n[807] Ziemann, _Deutsch. med. Wochenschr._, 1905, xi.\r\n\r\nOrchitis is in acute attacks a relatively frequent symptom in the East;\r\nthe chylocele is rarely marked; the fluid usually shows numerous\r\nlarvæ; in the case of abscesses they are generally caused directly by\r\nthe adult parasites, as they have often been found in them; varices of\r\nthe lymphatic vessels are either superficial or deep; lymphorrhagia\r\narises from rupture of the dilated vessels; chylous ascites and chylous\r\ndiarrhœa may also be produced by Filariæ.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Loa loa.*\r\n\r\n_Loa loa_, according to modern investigations, is a parasite of\r\nthe subcutaneous connective tissue of man, and its appearance in\r\nthe conjunctiva somewhat accidental; in earlier times it seems to\r\nhave been less common (Ziemann[808]). A number of cases are seen in\r\nEurope of patients who have lived in filaria regions, and on return\r\nhave been found to have this Nematode in the subconjunctival tissue.\r\nPick,[809] in the case of a man who had lived in the Cameroons, found\r\nthe parasites in active motion under the connective tissue of the\r\neyeball right over the cornea; extraction was easy. Ziemann[810] noted\r\nthree cases of _Loa loa_ in the eye accompanied by temporary migratory\r\nswellings in different parts of the body. In one case, observed by\r\nWurtz and Cleri[811] (a woman from the French Congo), _Loa loa_ was\r\nthe cause of intermittent elastic swellings in the subcutaneous and\r\nsubconjunctival tissue (marked eosinophilia). In the case recorded by\r\nPollack[812] (for thirty years police commissioner in the Cameroons)\r\nthe worm under the connective tissue of the left eye by its snake-like\r\nmovements caused an unpleasant itching. With cocaine and adrenalin\r\nthe worm can be made visible, and by means of a strabismus hook can\r\nbe drawn out of a small wound in the connective tissue. Martens[813]\r\nexhibited a Filaria extracted from the eyelid under local anæsthesia.\r\n\r\n[808] Ziemann, _Deutsch. med.

(For disturbances of the nervous system and of the blood\r\n[anæmia] from trichocephaliasis, _see_ p. 650). Infection in human\r\nbeings results from the eggs that have developed outside the body,\r\nwhich probably reach the digestive tract on the hands soiled with dirt\r\nor earth, or possibly through drinking water. (Moosbrugger[817] and\r\nKahane[818] mention in their cases that the children had an absolute\r\npassion for earth-eating.) Possibly, too, patients reinfect themselves\r\nanew, as an intermediate host is not necessary.\r\n\r\n[814] Leichtenstern, “Handb. d. Therap. v. Pentzoldt-Stintzing.”\r\n\r\n[815] Eichhorst, “Handb. d. Spez. Path. u. Therap.”\r\n\r\n[816] Askanazy, _Deutsch. Arch. f. klin. Med._, 1896.\r\n\r\n[817] Moosbrugger, _Med. Corresp.-Bl. f. Württemburg_, 1890.\r\n\r\n[818] Kahane, _Korrespondenzbl. f. Schweiz. Aezte_, 1907, viii.\r\n\r\nThe anterior part of the body of the parasite is usually fixed in the\r\nmucous membrane, and according to Askanazy feeds on the blood of its\r\nhost. Moosbrugger,[817] Schulze,[819] Kahane,[818] Vix,[820] Girard[821]\r\nand Blanchard[822] all found changes in the mucous membrane of the\r\ngut, showing that the parasites had been in the gut for a considerable\r\ntime. Kahane[818] had an opportunity of seeing at the Pasteur Institute\r\nTrichocephali with the anterior part of the body penetrating not\r\nonly the mucosa but also deep into the muscularis of the gut wall.\r\nFrom this mode of attachment to the wall it is easily understood how\r\nTrichocephali, especially when they are numerous in the gut, cause\r\nlocal irritation and inflammatory conditions consisting of frequent\r\nattacks of diarrhœa, sometimes twenty times a day, lasting for months,\r\nresisting all remedies, and often accompanied by colicky pains and\r\nsymptoms of peritonitis. The stools often have blood mixed with the\r\nfluid, very glassy, jelly-like mucus, more or less abundantly as in\r\nthe cases of Moesasca, Moosbrugger,[817] Kahane,[818] Girard,[821]\r\nPoledne,[823] and Rippe.[824] Nausea and vomiting are rarer symptoms.\r\n\r\n[819] Schulze, _Deutsch. med.

Wochenschr._, 1907.\r\n\r\nDiagnosis as a rule can only be made by microscopical examination of\r\nthe stools; together with the eggs, regular and beautifully formed\r\nCharcot-Leyden crystals occur.\r\n\r\nThe prognosis is unfavourable in severe infections, in slighter cases,\r\nwhere only a few worms are present, the danger of important symptoms\r\nis less. Treatment consists in administration _per os_ of vermicides\r\nand in local treatment of the large gut. A remedy which was once much\r\nused was calomel, which is much lauded by Gibson and given as follows:\r\ncalomel 0·06 grm., rheum. 0·3 grm., tinct. ferri sesquichlor. 1·2 c.c.,\r\naq. dest. 90·0 grm., six dessert-spoonfuls three times daily. Rippe\r\nappears to have got no result from the use of this prescription.\r\nThymol, especially in conjunction with local treatment of the large\r\nintestine, had unquestionably some effect in certain cases, such as\r\nthose of Girard, Poledne, Hausmann, Kahane and Schiller. The local\r\ntreatment of the large bowel is most effectual when high injections\r\nof water and benzine are given. Becker[825] obviously used too much\r\nbenzine (1 dessert-spoonful to 1 litre of water), for severe irritation\r\nwas set up, whilst Peiper[826] used only a few drops of benzine, 5\r\ndrops to 1 litre of water being enough (Schiller). Instead of benzine\r\nenemata, garlic, 1 per cent. thymol solution, and physiological saline\r\ninjections have been used, but the benzine enemata seem to be far and\r\naway the most effective. In Schiller’s case 2,000 worms came away\r\non the first day as the result of such a combined treatment (thymol\r\ninternally and benzine enemata).\r\n\r\n[825] Becker, _Deutsch. med. Wochenschr._, 1902.\r\n\r\n[826] Peiper, quoted by Seifert, _loc. cit._, p. 248.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrichinella spiralis.\r\n\r\nTrichinosis is, happily, becoming so much rarer that many doctors get\r\nno opportunity, either in their student days or in private practice,\r\nof seeing this severe disease; we ourselves remember having observed\r\none typical case of a peasant, aged 17, from Metz in Med.-Rat Merkel’s\r\nclinic in Nuremberg in the year 1879. In the description of the disease\r\nwe follow Merkel’s[827] observations.\r\n\r\n[827] Merkel, “Handb. d. Therap. v. Pentzoldt-Stintzing,” i.\r\n\r\nThe eating of flesh containing Trichinæ is often followed, if not\r\ninvariably so, by gastric disturbances of different kinds, especially\r\nby vomiting and diarrhœa, with colic, great muscular fatigue, œdema of\r\nthe eyelids, muscular swellings with hardness and extreme painfulness,\r\ndisturbance of ocular movements, of deglutition and of breathing,\r\nhoarseness, aphonia, intestinal hæmorrhage, bleeding of the nose,\r\necchymosis of the skin and mucosæ, prurigo, herpes, miliaria, pustules,\r\nboils, severe sweating, œdema of the extremities, and, finally,\r\ndesquamation of the skin; more rarely there is considerable decubitus,\r\nbronchial catarrh, hypostatic and catarrhal pneumonia, with dry and\r\npurulent pleurisy, and in severe cases symptoms of collapse with\r\ndelirium close the scene. Slight cases last from three to six weeks,\r\nsevere ones for several months, and in the latter convalescence is very\r\nslow. It is remarkable that in cases of trichinosis of long duration,\r\ncancer of the breast was observed at the same time (Klopsch,[828]\r\nLangenbeck,[829] Babes[830]). Death during epidemics occurred in 30 per\r\ncent. of all cases. The disease begins generally from one to ten days\r\nafter eating trichinous flesh, yet there have been cases noted in which\r\nthe disease began several weeks after.\r\n\r\n[828] Klopsch, quoted by Babes.\r\n\r\n[829] Langenbeck, _ibid._\r\n\r\n[830] Babes, _Centralbl. f. Bakt._, 1906, xlii.\r\n\r\nDiagnosis in the presence of several cases, or in epidemics, is not\r\ndifficult, but in isolated cases, on the other hand, it is not easy.\r\nIf there is a suspicion of trichinosis, from the muscular fatigue and\r\nthe œdema of the eyelids, the diagnosis can be made by excision of a\r\npiece of muscle and by finding the Trichinæ in the tissue, taken with\r\nthe results of the examination of the previously eaten sausage or meat.\r\nIn contradistinction to this circumstantial process, there is the\r\nexamination of the blood, which, according to Schleip[831] (Homburg\r\ntrichinosis epidemic, August 19 to 26, 1903, 130 cases), is the most\r\nvaluable method of diagnosing trichinosis when the Trichinæ have not\r\nyet penetrated the muscles, for a blood examination shows a large\r\nincrease in the numbers of the eosinophile cells; Stäubli detected\r\nhis seven cases in this way, four of the severe ones showing a marked\r\nhyperleucocytosis, and a combination of Kernig’s sign with absence of\r\nthe patellar reflex. On account of the rarity of these two signs in\r\ncombination in other infective diseases, they have a certain diagnostic\r\nvalue. Stäubli[832] also observed in trichinosis the constant\r\nappearance of a remarkably strong positive diazo-reaction of the urine.\r\n\r\n[831] Schleip, _Deutsch. Arch. f. klin. Med._, lxxx.\r\n\r\n[832] Stäubli, _ibid._, lxxxv.\r\n\r\nProphylaxis in trichinosis is fully considered under _Trichinella\r\nspiralis_ (p. 429).\r\n\r\nTreatment consists in those cases where it is known that trichinous\r\nflesh has been swallowed in the first place of washing out the stomach,\r\nbut still more in a thorough evacuation of the bowels, for which\r\ncalomel (0·5 grm.), ol. ricini (a dessert-spoonful till the action\r\nbecomes marked), infusion of senna with sulphate of magnesia and large\r\nenemata are employed, and should be repeated at intervals during the\r\nfirst few weeks. Alcohol (cognac up to 250 c.c. a day) is recommended\r\nby some, also glycerine (150 grm. at a dose) and large doses of dilute\r\nhydrochloric acid. Beside these, a large number of other remedies are\r\nrecommended, of which, perhaps, benzine and thymol, especially in the\r\nform of enemata, are worthy of notice.\r\n\r\nWhen the disease is fully developed the treatment should be\r\nsymptomatic; a protracted practically continuous luke-warm bath is\r\nespecially useful.\r\n\r\n\r\nEustrongylus gigas.\r\n\r\n_Eustrongylus gigas_ is most frequently found in the pelvis of the\r\nkidney. Infection in the majority of cases leads to pyelitis. The\r\ninflammation extends to the capsule from the pelvis, resulting in a\r\npurulent nephritis. In infections of longer duration, the affected\r\nkidneys become changed into so-called kidney sacs, while the kidney\r\nitself continuously shrinks. Owing to the worm fixing its posterior end\r\nin the ureter, and owing to an inflammatory swelling of the mucosa of\r\nthe ureter, the passage of urine becomes very difficult.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms resemble those caused by a foreign body, _e.g._, kidney\r\npain, suppression of urine, dysuria, discharge of blood and pus with\r\nthe urine. But these symptoms are not sufficient for a diagnosis; this\r\ncan only be established by finding eggs or the parasite itself in the\r\nurine.\r\n\r\nMoscato[833] records a case with chyluria, pain in the region of the\r\nright kidney, and hysterical symptoms. During an hysterical attack\r\na specimen of _Eustrongylus gigas_ was discharged in the urine, and\r\nthe chyluria and nervous affections disappeared. In a case described\r\nby Stuertz[834] of an Australian with chyluria due to _Eustrongylus\r\ngigas_ the chyluria had existed for seven years. In the urine the eggs\r\nof _Eustrongylus gigas_ were found. The cystoscopic examination showed\r\nthat turbid urine was discharging from the left ureter. Nephrectomy was\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n[833] Moscato, quoted by Predtetschensky, _Zeitschr. f. klin. Med._, xl.\r\n\r\n[834] Stuertz, _Ges. d. Charité-Aerzte in Berlin_, June 26, 1902.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Ancylostoma duodenale* (Ancylostomiasis).\r\n\r\nWhilst up to quite modern times it has been generally maintained that\r\nthe great majority of worm diseases cause more or less marked symptoms,\r\nthe exact investigations of the last few years have made it plain\r\nthat the great majority of people with worms are not only perfectly\r\nhealthy, but the most careful clinical observations show no single sign\r\nof any ill-effect of the intestinal parasites on the health of the\r\nhost (Löbker and Bruns[835]). If infection has led to the development\r\nof only a few ancylostomes, then injury to the general health is, as\r\na rule, scarcely noticeable. In order to produce severe illness the\r\npresence of several hundred worms in the intestine is necessary, and\r\nin general the intensity of illness varies in exact proportion to the\r\nnumber of worms. Then the duration of the infection comes into play:\r\nthe longer the human organism is submitted to the injurious effect\r\nof the parasite, the clearer is the effect on the host. Besides, the\r\nresistance of the individual has to be considered. Whilst a more robust\r\nperson can harbour without ill-effect for a longer time a larger number\r\nof ancylostomes, the symptoms of the disease become more markedly and\r\nmuch sooner apparent in weakly persons or in those weakened by other\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\n[835] Löbker and Bruns, _Arb. aus. dem. kaiserl. Gesundheitsamte_,\r\n1906, xxiii.\r\n\r\nThe first symptom is disturbance of the digestive system; more often\r\nthere is a feeling of pain in the epigastrium, more severe upon\r\npressure, heartburn, nausea, vomiting of mucus or food at different\r\ntimes of the day (occasionally ancylostome ova have been found in the\r\nvomit). Whether the eggs which reach the frontal sinus with the vomit\r\ncan develop into larvæ there is questionable, but the records of v.\r\nZiemssen[836] and Huppertz,[837] to the effect that in some instances\r\nancylostomes have been discharged from the frontal sinus, are of\r\ninterest. The five cases recorded by the latter had a fatal termination\r\nfrom œdematous swellings of the face with severe inflammation of the\r\nmeninges. The tongue is furred, and extensive catarrhal stomatitis\r\nand ptyalism are recorded. The appetite is variable, increasing or\r\ndiminishing, there is loathing of nourishment or a marked longing for\r\nacid food and unripe fruit, whilst ordinary meals are rejected. At\r\nfirst there is often constipation, later diarrhœa with abundant mucus,\r\nand often blood in the stools; microscopically eggs and Charcot-Leyden\r\ncrystals were found.\r\n\r\n[836] v. Ziemssen, quoted by Haenisch, “Diss. Strasburg,” 1901.\r\n\r\n[837] Huppertz, quoted by Haenisch, “Diss. Strasburg,” 1901.\r\n\r\nIn the further course of the disease symptoms due to increasing anæmia\r\npredominate; the hæmoglobin of the blood diminishes from one-fourth\r\nto one-fifth of the normal (Baravalle[838]), the eosinophile cells\r\nincrease considerably (Boycott,[839] Lohr[840]), yet in regard to\r\ndiagnosis eosinophilia cannot be regarded as of equal value to\r\na microscopical examination of the fæces (Bruns, Liefmann, and\r\nMeckel[841]). The disturbances of the circulatory system take the form\r\nof more or less severe palpitation, pain in the region of the heart,\r\nquick pulse, œdema of the eyelids, of the face, of the lower limbs, and\r\neven of the whole body. Disturbance of the sexual functions (impotence,\r\nirregular menstruation, delayed onset of puberty) are not infrequently\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n[838] Baravalle, _Progresso medico_, 1903.\r\n\r\n[839] Boycott, _Journ. of Hygiene_, 1904.\r\n\r\n[840] Lohr, _Zeitschr. f. Heilk._, xxvi.\r\n\r\n[841] Bruns, Liefmann and Meckel, _Münch. med. Wochenschr._, 1905.\r\n\r\nInfection in human beings takes place by the mouth, if uncleansed\r\nvegetables are eaten--in Japan especially, where human fæces are\r\nused--and articles of food are not sufficiently carefully cleaned\r\n(Inouye[842]), or from putting food into the mouth with dirty hands.\r\nLooss[843] does not think that drinking water is dangerous as a rule,\r\nfor the larvæ sink to the bottom in standing water, and are only\r\nbrought to the top by shaking. Looss has done most valuable service by\r\ndiscovering that infection can arise also through the skin. During the\r\nlast few years so many authors have confirmed this at first doubted\r\nsource of infection, that one must accept this source of infection\r\nnow, even though it is undecided which mode of infection is the\r\nmore prevalent, by the mouth or through the skin. Some authors have\r\ndescribed the changes induced in the skin by the penetration of the\r\nlarvæ; for instance, Looss and Schaudinn,[844] itching papules in their\r\nown skin, and Dieminger[845] a skin affection in the Graf Schwerin mine\r\nwhich was called the “Schweriner itch,” and a skin affection not unlike\r\nscabies in the tea plantations of Assam and South America; pani-ghao\r\n(water itch) (Dubreuilh[846]); the penetration of the larvæ through\r\nthe skin also explains the frequent appearance of boils and itching\r\npurulent eczema in miners in infected pits (Goldmann[847]).\r\n\r\n[842] Inouye, _Arch. f.

The\r\nspread of ancylostomiasis seems to depend only on fæces deposited in\r\ndamp places, so that on the one hand the deposition of fæces must\r\nbe prevented, and on the other the fæces must be rendered as far as\r\npossible harmless; in addition, there is the individual prophylaxis.\r\n\r\nGeneral prophylaxis requires:--\r\n\r\n(1) Examination immediately for ancylostomes of miners seeking work and\r\nof those newly taken on five to six weeks after.\r\n\r\n(2) Indentured workers who are infected with worms are not allowed to\r\nwork underground until a medical certificate in writing is brought to\r\nthe effect that they are no more infected with eggs (the same procedure\r\napplies to workmen in brick kilns) (Goldmann[848]).\r\n\r\n[848] _Ibid._, “Die Hygiene des Bergmannes.” Halle: W. Knapp, 1903.\r\n\r\n(3) Indentured workers infected with worms must submit themselves to\r\nthe prescribed treatment, and after its completion further submit their\r\nstools to three examinations at intervals of about four weeks.`\r\n\r\n(4) Special supervision of miners and brick-makers coming from the\r\nItalian frontier.\r\n\r\n(5) Workmen must be given instructions, both by word of mouth and in\r\nwriting in their mother tongue, as to the infectivity and danger of\r\nancylostomiasis both to themselves and others.\r\n\r\n(6) Orders are to be given as to washing, baths, and changing of\r\nclothes at the end of the work.\r\n\r\n(7) During the hours of working in the pits, taking of food is strictly\r\nforbidden without thorough and entire washing.\r\n\r\n(8) All privies must be so arranged that the vessels used for the\r\nreception of the excreta must not leak, must be protected by a cover,\r\nand easily transportable. The emptying of these vessels must be carried\r\nout in specially constructed impenetrable pits.\r\n\r\n(9) Defæcation in any other place than a privy is forbidden (alike for\r\nminers and brick-makers).\r\n\r\n(10) The manure of horses used in the mines is to be regularly\r\nremoved; possibly infection takes place in this way also. [This is\r\nimpossible.--J. W. W. S.]\r\n\r\nHow far it is possible to disinfect a mine already severely infected is\r\na matter of question; Tenholt,[849] Goldmann,[850] and Dieminger[851]\r\nrecommend washing out with freshly prepared lime water with the\r\naddition of caustic soda; Calmette[852] and Manouriez[853] spraying\r\nwith salt water. Theoretically spraying with hot water or steam\r\nshould be done every now and again for the destruction of the larvæ\r\n(Looss[854]). Personal prophylaxis is partially included in the general\r\nprophylaxis in so far as it is a case of oral infection, but something\r\nmore can be done for the individual to avert the danger of cutaneous\r\ninfection. According to Manson[855] it is advisable in the tropics to\r\ncover the naked hands and feet with green Barbados tar, and the tarred\r\nparts thickly with flour; Fabre[856] recommends that miners who might\r\ncome in contact with infected water should anoint the unprotected parts\r\n(hands and feet), as then the larvæ cannot penetrate the skin; this\r\nlast procedure can easily be carried out on account of its simplicity\r\nand cheapness.\r\n\r\n[849] Tenholt, _Münch. med.

The day before the beginning of treatment one should\r\nendeavour to procure a thorough evacuation of the bowels by means of\r\ncalomel (Lutz,[858] Grünberger,[859] Smith[860]) or cascara sagrada\r\n(Mann[861]), only fluid food should be taken the evening before, and\r\non the day of treatment thymol is given in a quantity of 6, 8, 10 or\r\n15 grm., in single doses of 2 grm. with one or two hours’ interval,\r\nand some hours after an aperient. As a rule, one day of this treatment\r\nis not enough. (Prowe[862]), but one is compelled to repeat it on two\r\nconsecutive days, or even oftener, with subsequent intervals of many\r\ndays. Thymol is either given in wafers, gelatine capsules or mixed with\r\nsugar. Caution should be used in giving brandy at the same time or[sic]\r\nbodies which dissolve thymol (oil, fat) and thereby considerably favour\r\nits absorption. It has been shown in many cases from toxic phenomena\r\nthat thymol is by no means an indifferent drug; violent burning in the\r\nstomach and alimentary canal, lowering of the temperature, shortness\r\nof breath and feeble pulse, giddiness, delirium and fainting have\r\nall been observed. Sandwith[863] and Thornhill,[864] as well as\r\nLeichtenstern,[865] even record cases of death after the use of thymol;\r\n4 grm. thymol caused severe symptoms of poisoning in Grünberger’s[866]\r\ncase. The black colour of the urine (thymoluria) which so often sets\r\nin after the first dose is quite harmless, and is no contra-indication\r\nto the continuance of the cure. Now and again there are traces of\r\nalbumin in the urine, but it is very seldom there is any severe acute\r\ninflammation of the kidneys. Thymol is contra-indicated in advanced\r\nold age and in debility, also in cases with a tendency to vomiting, in\r\ngastritis, dysentery, heart or kidney affections.\r\n\r\n[857] Bozzolo, _Giorn. del R.

Nagel[875] prescribes\r\nextr. fil. 8 to 10 grm., chloroform 10 to 15 drops, syr. sennæ 16 grm.;\r\nbefore taking, the glass must be placed in hot water, otherwise the\r\ncontents will not pour freely. Zinn[876] prefers extract. filicis\r\nmaris (freshly prepared) to all other drugs. Warburg[877] considers\r\nthe treatment with extr. fil. to be all the more certain the more\r\nthoroughly the preliminary treatment is carried out. Filmaron\r\n0·7 grm., thymol 5·0 grm., chloroform 1·5 grm., ol. ricini 20·0 grm.\r\ngave good results after being given two to three times (Nagel[878]).\r\nOpinions are divided as to the combination of thymol and extractum\r\nfilicis maris (Hynek,[879] Stockman,[880] Boycott and Haldane,[881]\r\nAdams[882]). As regards other remedies, eucalyptus oil is well spoken\r\nof by Philips[883] and Hermann[884]: ol. eucalypti 2·0 grm., chloroform\r\n3·0 grm., ol. ricini 30·0 grm., to be taken at one time or in three\r\nseparate doses in the morning (on the previous evening a saline\r\npurgative). Neumann[885] recommends podophyllin, to be taken twice\r\non three consecutive days in doses of 0·035 grm. Podophyllin appears\r\nto produce quite a peculiar condition of the intestinal mucosa which\r\nis very prejudicial to the Ancylostoma adhering to it. Bentley[886]\r\nregards β-naphthol as the best drug; after previous examination of the\r\nbowels he gives it two or three times at two-hourly intervals, in doses\r\nup to 1·0 grm. (_Vide_ also the Appendix, p. 754, for other drugs.) For\r\nthe treatment of the anæmia, which often persists very obstinately,\r\ngood and abundant food, iron and arsenic preparations, Levico water\r\n(Goldmann,[887] Liermberger[888]) are suitable.\r\n\r\n[873] Mann, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\n[874] Grünberger, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\n[875] Nagel, _Deutsch. med.

The normal situation\r\nis the small intestine; this, however, is frequently left, and the\r\nAscarides travel into the stomach, œsophagus, pharynx, bronchi, the\r\nnasal cavities and still other regions. It is a peculiarity of the\r\nAscarides that they are prone to glide into narrow canals; for example,\r\nClason[889] records that in the case of an idiot whose custom it\r\nwas to swallow glass beads, the Ascarides showed a predilection for\r\nsticking in the beads and were passed in the fæces. The disturbances\r\nwhich Ascarides occasion in the intestine itself vary; isolated species\r\ndo not give rise to any symptoms at all, whereas a large number may\r\neventually give rise to severe local symptoms, or those of a toxic or\r\nreflex nature which have been discussed in the General Section.\r\n\r\n[889] Clason, _see_ Seifert, _Deutsch. med. Zeitg._, 1885.\r\n\r\nAmong the local symptoms are the following: loss of appetite, excessive\r\nappetite, perverted sense of taste, fœtid breath, sensitiveness to\r\npressure over the abdomen, colicky pains and irregularity of the\r\nbowels. The appearance and state of health suffer; the patients,\r\nchildren in especial frequency, become remarkably pale; their\r\ncomplexions undergo rapid change, and rings of grey or bluish-brown\r\nare seen about the eyes. Children may become so reduced by this rare\r\ncondition, enteritis verminosa, due to Ascarides in large numbers,\r\nthat suspicion of the existence of intestinal tuberculosis arises.\r\nEmaciation to a skeleton, excessive meteorism, and evacuations of thin\r\ngruel-like stools, sometimes blood-stained, are observed in these\r\ncases. Even in the case of adults, chronic uncontrollable vomiting\r\nwith severe inanition due to the Ascarides has been observed. When the\r\nAscarides escape spontaneously _per anum_, they frequently cause an\r\nexceedingly troublesome irritation in the anal region (pruritus ani).\r\n\r\nThe most disagreeable symptoms and those most dangerous to life arise\r\nfrom the migrations of Ascarides when they invade the bile-ducts;\r\nno inconsiderable number of cases of this kind are recorded in\r\nthe literature (summarized, up to the year 1901, in Sick’s[890]\r\nDissertation). Penetration _post mortem_ (or shortly before death) of\r\nthe worms into the bile-ducts cannot be considered as a rarity; the\r\nlaxity of the muscular orifices easily allows of this invasion also\r\nin other directions on the part of the parasite in its escape from\r\nthe body of its dead host. The occurrence of the worm in the biliary\r\npassages in the living is to be regarded as still less frequent, but\r\nnevertheless often enough according to the records in literature.\r\nSick[891] was able to collect as many as sixty-one such cases, to which\r\nhe added two further fresh cases from the Tübingen clinic, that is,\r\nfrom the material provided by his father. In the year 1891 Borger[892]\r\ncollected fifty-nine cases relating to the invasion by _Ascaridæ_ of\r\nthe bile-ducts and passages, and Dauernheim’s[893] Dissertation treats\r\nof this question as well. A further case of Ascaris in the ductus\r\ncholedochus (choledochotomy) is recorded by Neugebauer.[894] In the\r\ncase of Schupper[895] (woman, aged 52), all the biliary passages were\r\ndistended and filled with fourteen living _Ascaridæ_ (perhaps as they\r\nwere living they had not led to a septic infection of the biliary\r\npassages); in the case communicated by Schiller,[896] an Ascaris\r\nhad gained access to the biliary passages after an operation for\r\ncholelithiasis (with distension of the gall-bladder and formation of a\r\nfistula); it had kept itself alive here eighteen days and was extracted\r\nfrom the fistulous opening. Epstein[897] confirms the correctness\r\nof the explanation of the mark of strangulation in an Ascaris in\r\nMertens’[898] case (in a woman, aged 30, there was first icterus,\r\nlater ascites, anasarca, swelling of the liver, then the discharge of\r\ntwo dead _Ascaridæ_, one of which exhibited a constriction somewhat\r\nbehind its centre; after that there was rapid improvement in all the\r\nsymptoms); in his case there was icterus in consequence of closure\r\nof the ductus choledochus by an Ascaris. After the discharge of the\r\nworm the symptoms persisted; one of the _Ascaridæ_ had a typical\r\nstrangulation mark. From the observation recorded by Vierordt[899]\r\nit follows that, without doubt, mature females can penetrate into\r\nthe liver and there deposit eggs; in addition, that such eggs appear\r\nexceptionally to undergo segmentation. A unique feature in this case\r\nconsisted in the exclusive discharge of immature worms almost regularly\r\nthroughout an interval of nine weeks; this cannot be explained from our\r\npresent knowledge of the biology and pathology of the _Ascaridæ_. These\r\nworms clearly make their way from the intestine outwards, through the\r\nopening into the duodenum of the common bile-duct, and unquestionably\r\nthe fully developed Ascarides, with the aid of their conical head end,\r\nare enabled gradually to penetrate the wall of the ductus choledochus\r\n(Quincke[900]), and gain access to the gall-bladder, the hepatic duct\r\nand its branches.\r\n\r\n[890] Sick, “Diss.

The blocking\r\nof the common bile-duct and of the trunk of the hepatic duct leads to\r\nthe well-known symptoms of biliary engorgement; protracted continuance\r\nof this condition has, as its sequela, general distension of the whole\r\nbiliary system and degenerative destruction of the liver-cells. If\r\nthe Ascaris is situated at some other part of the biliary system,\r\nits presence causes a partial arrest of the flow of bile, with the\r\ncorresponding sequelæ. Many Ascarides perish in the ductus choledochus,\r\nand here and in the gall-bladder they may supply the nucleus of a\r\ngall-stone; deeper in the liver this does not appear to happen; the\r\ndead _Ascaridæ_ here undergo a kind of maceration, disintegrate, and\r\nmay be completely absorbed; in many cases the worms continue to live\r\nfor a very long time in the biliary passages. When the worms infect the\r\nbiliary passages through the invasion of intestinal bacteria, liver\r\nabscesses arise (Dauernheim,[901] Saltykow[902]). Leer[903] goes so\r\nfar as to maintain that _Ascaridæ_ may be the second most frequent\r\ncause of liver abscesses. That Ascaris in the pancreas may simulate\r\nliver abscess in a remarkable fashion is shown by Vierordt’s[904]\r\nobservation, which is quite unique, while _Ascaridæ_ have been found to\r\noccur in isolated instances in the excretory ducts of the pancreas and\r\nin its branches, where they have remained living for a long time.\r\n\r\n[901] Dauernheim, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\n[902] Saltykow, _Prag. Zeitschr. f. Heilk._, 1900.\r\n\r\n[903] Leer, _Brit. Med. Journ._, 1906.\r\n\r\n[904] Vierordt, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\nIt is no rare occurrence for _Ascaridæ_, in consequence of their\r\nmigration into the stomach, to be ejected by the act of vomiting, and\r\nin such way to gain access into the upper air passages, or to find\r\ntheir way during sleep into the nose or accessory sinuses (Mosler and\r\nPeiper[905]) without giving rise to special symptoms. For example,\r\nTroja[906] found in the frontal sinus of a cadaver a large coiled-up\r\nAscaris which occupied the whole cavity. Wrisberg[907] made the same\r\nobservation in the cadaver of a boy. Deschamps[908] and Fortessin[909]\r\nmention an Ascaris being met with in the antrum of Highmore.\r\nObservations of the discharge of living or dead Ascarides from the\r\nnose are frequently recorded. To this class belongs the case mentioned\r\nby Albrecht,[910] in which an Ascaris was removed from the nose of a\r\ngirl, aged 7; also the case recorded by Benievini,[911] from the nose\r\nof one of whose friends a worm escaped; he had suffered from the most\r\nviolent headaches, fainting fits, dimness of vision and vomiting; after\r\nthe escape those untoward symptoms disappeared. Similar records have\r\nbeen made by Forest,[912] Lanzoni,[913] Langelott,[914] Tulpe,[915]\r\nReisel,[916] Fehr,[917] Bruckmann,[918] Bahr,[919] Slabber,[920]\r\nLange,[921] and Chiari.[922] A rarer case is that recorded by\r\nHaffner,[923] that of a child, aged 4, in whom an Ascaris reached the\r\nnasal cavity through the act of vomiting, and from there it gained\r\naccess through the naso-lachrymal duct and the inferior lachrymal sac\r\ninto the lower punctum lachrymale, from which half of it protruded.\r\n\r\n[905] Mosler and Peiper, “Nothnagel’s Handb.,” 1894, vi.\r\n\r\n[906] Troja, Napoli, 1771.\r\n\r\n[907] Wrisberg, _see_ Blumenbach, Göttingen, 1907.\r\n\r\n[908] Deschamps, _see_ Blass, “Diss.

Oesterlein[928] records a fatal attack\r\nof choking from _Ascaridæ_ in the trachea. In a case recorded by\r\nSmyly[929] of a boy, aged 3-1/2, tracheotomy for extreme asphyxia\r\nwas performed without relief. At the _post-mortem_ the cause of\r\nthe asphyxia was found to be an Ascaris in the trachea. Fürst[930]\r\ncollected twenty-five observations of invasion of the larynx and\r\ntrachea by Ascaris. Mosler[931] reports the case of a patient with\r\naphonia and dyspnœa from whose larynx an Ascaris was removed.\r\nDonati[932] reports a case of four Ascarides in the larynx, and\r\nCerchez[933] of asphyxia from Ascarides in the larynx or trachea.\r\nWagner[934] records the case of a boy, aged 8, in whom a coil of worms\r\nwas ejected from the stomach by vomiting; the mass blocked the entrance\r\nto the larynx and led to death from suffocation. A case similar to that\r\nrecorded by Smyly is communicated by Rabot[935]; it was that of a child\r\nwho underwent tracheotomy for diphtheria, and who was not relieved by\r\nthe operation; when, however, an Ascaris appeared in the cannula and\r\nthe parasite was removed the child breathed well. In Negresco’s[936]\r\ncase, that of a boy, aged 3, an Ascaris gained access to the larynx and\r\nfrom there into the trachea, and a fatal issue from asphyxia resulted.\r\n\r\n[928] Oesterlein, _Deutsch.

Schlüter[937] treated a woman, aged 60, with\r\nretention of urine. Upon catheterization the hinder end of an Ascaris\r\nhung out from the catheter opening; the anterior end was fixed in the\r\ntube and the lumen was obstructed. Perhaps in the female sex _Ascaridæ_\r\ntravel from the gut into the vulva and from there into the bladder,\r\nas they have already been observed in the vagina, where they cause\r\ntroublesome symptoms (pruritus pudendi).\r\n\r\n[937] Schlüter, _Münch. med. Wochenschr._, 1902.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis of ascariasis is not in general difficult; now and then\r\nthe worms are discharged spontaneously; if not, the ova, which cannot\r\nbe mistaken, can easily be detected in the fæces upon microscopical\r\nexamination. Epstein’s[938] method--namely, on every occasion to\r\nobtain fresh material for examination--is much to be recommended. This\r\nconsists in introducing a Nelaton’s catheter into the rectum with a\r\nrotatory motion and then drawing it out. A small portion of fæces\r\nforced into the catheter opening is more than sufficient to demonstrate\r\nthe presence of ova of the parasites upon microscopical examination of\r\na preparation.\r\n\r\n[938] Epstein, _see_ Seifert, “Lehrb. d. Kinderkrankh.,” p. 273.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all pressure on the part of relatives, treatment directly\r\nagainst _Ascaridæ_ should not be carried out until the diagnosis is\r\ncertain.\r\n\r\nAs regards prophylaxis, much can be done by not throwing the worms,\r\nwhen expelled, on to the dung-hill or into the privy, but straightway\r\ninto the fire. Metschnikoff[939] has issued a warning against\r\nthe consumption of unboiled or badly washed vegetables, salad,\r\nstrawberries, etc., and also against drinking polluted water.\r\n\r\n[939] Metschnikoff, _Gaz. hebd. de Méd. et Chir._, 1901.\r\n\r\nFor the expulsion of the worms flores cinæ were formerly considered\r\nthe most useful means; now, however, santonic lactone--santonin--which\r\nis prepared from them, is almost universally preferred. By many,\r\nespecially in practising among children, flores cinæ are still\r\nrecommended in the form of Störk’s worm electuary (consisting of flores\r\ncinæ, rad. jalapæ, valerian and oxymel simplex). Guermonprez[940]\r\nrecommends them because he thinks that santonin only excites the worms\r\nand consequently causes unpleasant symptoms. Besides, in the form of\r\nthe above-mentioned electuary, flores cinæ can also be given several\r\ntimes daily with raspberry jelly up to 0·5 grm. to 2 grm. (children and\r\nadults).\r\n\r\n[940] Guermonprez, _see_ Seifert, _Deutsch. med. Zeitg._, 1885.\r\n\r\nSantonin is prescribed either in single doses from 0·03 to 0·05 to\r\n0·1 grm. with sugar in the form of powder, or else in oily solution.\r\nWhen given in the latter form the absorption of the santonin in\r\nthe stomach is excluded and the whole quantity introduced is thus\r\nenabled to reach the worms in the intestinal canal. Küchenmeister[941]\r\nhas already recommended combination of santonin with ol. ricini.\r\nLewin,[942] however, states that ol. morrhuæ, ol. olivarum, ol. cocos\r\nand ol. cinæ can also be taken. In prescribing santonin in oily\r\nsolution Henoch[943] also prefers the combination with ol. ricini.\r\nAccording to Lewin’s direction the prescription would run as follows:--\r\n\r\n  ℞ Santonin              0·2 grm.\r\n    Ol. ricini.           20·0 grm.\r\n    Ol. cinæ æth.         gtt. iv.\r\n\r\n    M., d.s.\r\n    S., one tablespoonful to be taken two to three times.\r\n\r\n[941] Küchenmeister, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\n[942] Lewin, _see_ Seifert, _Deutsch. med. Zeitg._, 1885.\r\n\r\n[943] Henoch, _idem_.\r\n\r\nIf the patients should manifest a repugnance to castor oil, Starke’s\r\nricinus paste may be selected:--\r\n\r\n  ℞ Santonin              0·2 grm.\r\n    Ol. ricini            20·0 grm.\r\n    Ol. cinæ æth.         gtt. iv.\r\n    Sacch. albi.          q.s.\r\n\r\n    Pasta moliis.\r\n    S., to be used for two days.\r\n\r\nIf necessary the first-mentioned mixture might be given in gelatine\r\ncapsules. Small children should be given 0·025 grm. santonin in warm\r\nolive oil slightly sweetened with sugar (a teaspoonful) in the morning;\r\nif in the course of the forenoon specimens of Ascaris escape, a second\r\ndose should follow in the afternoon about two hours after the meal.\r\nOlder children should be given santonin in combination with castor oil\r\nor calomel:--\r\n\r\n  ℞ Santonini             0·01 to 0·02 to 0·03 grm.\r\n    Calomelan             0·025 grm.\r\n    Sacch. albi.          0·5 grm.\r\n\r\n    M.f.p.   D. tal. dos. x.\r\n    S., one powder about six, seven, and eight o’clock on three consecutive days.\r\n\r\nAs santonin causes slight toxic symptoms such as urticaria, vomiting,\r\nretention of urine, headache, vertigo, yellow vision (xanthopsia), it\r\nis in every case advisable to follow with a laxative to expel the drug\r\nfrom the body as speedily as possible. The urine is coloured yellow\r\nfrom one to two days and assumes a scarlet red colour upon the addition\r\nof alkalis; this, however, soon disappears, while it persists in the\r\ncase of rhubarb and senna.\r\n\r\nIn the place of santonin iodoform in the form of a powder mixed with\r\nbicarbonate of soda is given by Schidlowsky[944] in doses up to 0·01\r\nto 0·06 grm. three times daily, and a dose of castor oil on the day\r\nafter the iodoform is given. Thymol in addition to thymol enemas may\r\nbe tried, in doses up to 0·5 to 2·0 grm. per diem (Calderone,[945]\r\nHausmann[946]), also β-naphthol up to 0·45 grm. three times daily (Du\r\nBois[947]), and--\r\n\r\n  ℞ Benzo-naphthol        2·0 grm.\r\n    Semin cinæ            1·0 grm.\r\n    Sacch. albi.          0·5 grm.\r\n\r\n    M., f.p.

Brüning[950],[951]\r\nrecommends the so-called American worm-seed oil, derived from a plant\r\nnative to the United States, _Chenopodium anthelminticum_, Gray. It\r\nis given in emulsion (ol. chenopodii anthelm. 10·0 grm., vitelli\r\novi unius, ol. amygd., gi. arab. pulver. āā 10·0 grm., aq. destill.\r\n200 grm.; f. emulsio) up to 0·25 to 0·5 grm. three times daily at\r\none to two-hourly intervals, or as a pure oil from 8 to 15 drops in\r\nsugar and water; to be followed an hour after the last dose by oleum\r\nricini or pulvis curellæ. If no action takes place by the afternoon,\r\na laxative should again be given. The treatment frequently must be\r\nrepeated the next day. Thelen[952] appears to have had good results\r\nfrom this drug.\r\n\r\n[948] Ferran, _idem_.\r\n\r\n[949] Bodenstein, _Wien. med. Presse_, 1906.\r\n\r\n[950] Brüning, _Med.

Rostock,” 1907.\r\n\r\nCorsican moss (mousse de Corse), kamala, _Artemisia absinthium_,\r\nvalerian, semen sabadillæ, have all been supplanted by santonin and at\r\nmost are used as adjuvants for the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Oxyuris vermicularis* (Oxyuriasis).\r\n\r\n_Oxyuridæ_ do not remain at rest in the gut, but leave it, generally\r\nat night time, to migrate around the anus, into the gluteal folds, and\r\nin females into the vulva and vagina and still higher up, giving rise\r\nin these different sites to a whole series of irritative symptoms. In\r\nthe rectum, also, _Oxyuridæ_ give rise to such symptoms, which are\r\nmanifested in the form of catarrhal inflammation; numerous chronic\r\nintestinal catarrhs are thus explained. The frequent coincidence of\r\nhæmorrhoidal troubles with _Oxyuridæ_ may be attributed to the fact\r\nthat the veins of the rectum participate in those changes which have\r\nbeen described as occurring in the intestinal mucosa. _Oxyuridæ_\r\nmay also give rise to prolapse of the anus, either by the tenesmus\r\nthey bring about having such a prolapse as its direct sequel, or the\r\nproctitis that supervenes constituting a further etiological factor for\r\nits occurrence (Ungar[953]). Anal fistulæ which still further increase\r\nthe trouble, and even rectal fistulæ, appear to be capable of onset in\r\nconsequence of the irritation of the mucosa brought about by _Oxyuridæ_\r\n(Trendelenburg[954]). The conditions recorded by von Wagener[955] and\r\nRuffer[956] appear to be of interest. At the _post-mortem_ on a child,\r\naged 5, the former found fifteen to twenty quite minute nodules on some\r\nPeyer’s patches, and in several of these _Oxyuridæ_ were found upon\r\nmicroscopical examination between the calcareous concretions within\r\nthe patches. He presumes that the parasites penetrated the follicular\r\nulcers, and after healing of the latter that they died and became\r\ncalcified. In the case of a man who died from cirrhosis of the liver,\r\nRuffer found in the rectum, at a distance of about 6 in. from the anal\r\norifice, several tumours covered by the intestinal mucosa, the smallest\r\nof which was the size of a pin’s head and the largest that of a walnut.\r\nThe tumours looked like calculi overgrown by connective tissue; under\r\nthe microscope, countless _Oxyuridæ_ ova were found in their interior.\r\n\r\n[953] Ungar, _see_ Seifert, “Lehrbuch der Kinderkrankh.,” p. 246.\r\n\r\n[954] Trendelenburg, _see_ Seifert, _idem_.\r\n\r\n[955] von Wagener, _Deutsch. Arch. f. klin. Med._, lxxxi.\r\n\r\n[956] Ruffer, _Brit. Med. Journ._, 1901.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of irritation set up by these migrations from the\r\nintestine are troublesome to the last degree; the pruritus thereby\r\ninduced is often unendurable; as this irritation from itching comes on\r\nwith especial severity during the night, the night’s rest is grievously\r\ninterfered with; many attacks of night terrors appear to be occasioned\r\nby these worms. But the general condition suffers as well; the children\r\nbecome pallid and affected with nervous excitability. Through the\r\nact of scratching the irritated parts the ova of the parasites may\r\nbe conveyed by contaminated fingers directly into the oral or nasal\r\ncavities, certainly also into the oral cavity by the contamination of\r\nfood (auto-infection). In the case of boys the sexual organs may be\r\nexcited sympathetically through irritation of the sacral nerves of the\r\nrectum; girls may be induced to practise onanism in consequence of the\r\nentrance of the worms into the vulva.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the itching irritation which the scratching gives rise\r\nto, and of the irritation due to the parasites migrating to the area\r\nsurrounding the anus, congestion and inflammatory symptoms may arise\r\nin the peri-anal and perineal regions (weeping eczema, Seifert),[957]\r\nand these do not abate till after the removal of the oxyuriasis. Some\r\nauthors speak of an oxyuriasis cutanea (Majochi[958]), in the more\r\nlimited sense of a dermatitis intertriginoides. So far five such\r\ncases have been recorded, one each by Szerlecky,[959] Michelson,[960]\r\nMajochi,[961] Barbagallo[962] and Vignolo-Lutati.[963] Szerlecky’s case\r\nwas that of a young woman with intertrigo over the thighs (the skin\r\nwas covered as if with leather); Michelson’s case was that of a boy,\r\naged 13, with intertrigo on the skin of the genito-crural fold, of the\r\nscrotum and of the thigh; Majochi’s was that of a man, aged 38, with\r\nthe same localization; Barbagallo’s case was that of a boy, aged 14,\r\nin whom the dermatitis extended to the hypogastrium (rhagades on the\r\nscrotum); and Vignolo-Lutati’s case was that of a man, aged 24, with\r\nintertrigo of the peri-anal and perineal region, of the scrotum and the\r\ninner side of the thigh.\r\n\r\n[957] Seifert, “Lehrb. d.

Chiari[965] records the case of a girl, aged 14, who\r\nsuffered from pains at the root of the nose and in the left side of the\r\nforehead; female specimens of _Oxyuris vermicularis_ were evacuated\r\nfrom her nose on several occasions. A similar case is recorded by\r\nHartmann[966]; it was that of a girl, aged 13, with epileptiform\r\nconvulsions and psychic disturbances; numerous Oxyurides frequently\r\nescaped from her nose. With their departure the symptoms of irritation\r\nof the central nervous system also disappeared. Rheins[967] records a\r\ncase, that of a woman, in which a specimen of _Oxyuris vermicularis_\r\nwas discharged from the right nostril during the act of sneezing.\r\nProskauer[968] found in the nose of a woman, aged 30, a conglomerate\r\nof from fifteen to twenty very small worms which proved to be Oxyuris\r\nembryos.\r\n\r\n[964] Zarniko, “Die Krankh. d.

With reference to the first-mentioned point,\r\nMetschnikoff’s[969] directions should be borne in mind, to the effect\r\nthat badly washed vegetables, salad, etc., ought not to be eaten\r\n(vegetables to be rinsed with boiling water), and also that the\r\nmembers of the family of the diseased individual should be examined\r\nfor _Oxyuridæ_ and eventually be treated (Heller[970]). With regard\r\nto the second point, one has to observe strict cleanliness in general\r\n(Barbagallo[971] found ova of the parasites in the layer of dirt under\r\nthe finger-nails).\r\n\r\n[969] Metschnikoff, _Med. Klin._, 1907, xlii, p. 1284.\r\n\r\n[970] Heller, _Deutsch. Arch. f. klin. Med._, lxxvii.\r\n\r\n[971] Barbagallo, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\nTreatment of oxyuriasis must be of a twofold nature; first, medicinal,\r\nthe administration _per os_ of vermicidal drugs in combination with\r\npurgatives; and secondly, local treatment of the gut by means of\r\nenemata, suppositories and high injections. Following the method\r\nprescribed by Ungar,[972] pulv. glycyrrhizæ co. is first given in\r\nthe case of smaller children, castor oil or calomel in that of those\r\nolder, in order to evacuate the intestine, and four times daily on\r\ntwo days following one another a dose of naphthalin, not directly\r\nafter meal-time, but as far as possible in the interval between two\r\nmeals, and at the same time the ingestion of fatty or oily nutriment\r\nis as far as possible to be avoided. After eight days this treatment\r\nshould be repeated, and under certain circumstances once again after\r\na further interval of a fortnight. The dose varies between 0·05 and\r\n0·1 grm. (children of 1 year old), 0·1 to 0·2 grm. (children of 2 to\r\n3 years old) and 0·2 to 0·4 grm. (children of 4 to 10 years old).\r\nDornblüth[973] employs the same medicament in a form only slightly\r\nmodified from Ungar’s method, Barbagallo[974] gives internally only a\r\npurgative (decoct. sennæ cum natr. sulfur). Thymol, santonin, kousso,\r\nkamala or valerian may be tried instead of naphthalin. For enemata\r\nthe following are employed: naphthalin in a solution of 1 in 50, ol.\r\nolivar. or thymol 0·1 in 200 aq. destill., diluted solutions of lysol,\r\nmenthol in 1/2 per cent. oily solution, salicylate of soda in watery\r\nsolution, decoctum tannaceti with santonin, with the addition of some\r\ndrops of ol. terebinth. (Barbagallo). Decoctions of garlic, infusion of\r\nvalerian, sulphur water (sublimate is to be avoided), aq. calcariæ, ol.\r\nolivarum camphoratum (Vignolo-Lutati). Santonin 0·1 grm. is the best\r\nto employ for suppositories.\r\n\r\n[972] Ungar, _see_ Seifert, “Lehrb. d. Kinderkrankh.”\r\n\r\n[973] Dornblüth, _Arztl. Zentral-Anzeiger_, 1903.\r\n\r\n[974] Barbagallo, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\nFor high injections, large quantities of plain water are employed (2\r\nto 4 litres), or soapy water (0·2 to 0·5 per cent. solution of sapo\r\nmedicatus, Heller,[975] Still[976]), 1/2 per cent. salicylic acid\r\nsolution or liq. alum. acet. (one tablespoonful to a litre of water,\r\nDornblüth[977]), or gujanosol (2 to 3 to 4 to 5 per cent. solution,\r\nRahn[978]). The employment of benzine for such high injections is not\r\nadvisable according to the experience of Senger,[979] owing to the\r\nsymptoms of poisoning after the external application of benzine, at\r\nleast not in the case of young children.\r\n\r\n[975] Heller, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\n[976] Still, _Brit.

Inunctions of cod-liver\r\noil appear to be very valuable in the treatment of oxyuriasis\r\n(Szerlecky, Vignolo-Lutati), whilst those with mercurial ointment may\r\neasily increase the inflammatory symptoms. The luxury recommended by\r\nEsser,[981] that patients every evening before going to sleep should\r\nhave the female _Oxyuridæ_ picked from the anal fold in the knee-elbow\r\nposition is one which is certainly only in the power of a few people to\r\ncarry into execution.\r\n\r\n[980] Seifert, _Deutsch. med. Zeitg._, 1885.\r\n\r\n[981] Esser, _Schweiz. Korrespondenzbl._, 1893.\r\n\r\n  An essay has been published by Hippius and Lewinson (_Deutsch. med.\r\n  Wochenschr._, 1907, xliii.) in which the relationship of _Oxyuridæ_\r\n  to appendicitis is considered and the treatment of oxyuriasis is\r\n  discussed. The instructive case recorded appears to show that germs\r\n  through _Oxyuridæ_ gain access to the tissue of the appendix,\r\n  and, indeed, are carried in by them. In view of this more recent\r\n  communication as to the part which intestinal parasites play in the\r\n  etiology of appendicitis, it seemed to me [O. S.] to be worth while\r\n  to interrogate my surgical colleagues as to this point. About 2,000\r\n  appendicectomies have been jointly performed by Drs. Burkhardt,\r\n  Enderlen, Pretzfelder, Riedinger, Rosenberger and Siber, and in not\r\n  one of these cases could entozoa be found to be a possible cause\r\n  of the appendicitis. Such figures without doubt speak in favour of\r\n  the fact that even if in _individual_ cases entozoa might come into\r\n  reckoning as a possible cause, such an etiological factor must be\r\n  classed among the greatest of rarities. My colleague, Dr. Ries, who\r\n  practised for ten years in Mexico, informed me that there practically\r\n  speaking every Indian without exception harboured parasites of\r\n  the most varied kind, and that in spite of the very extensive\r\n  professional standing he enjoyed among these people he never had\r\n  under observation among them a single case of appendicitis. As far\r\n  as the observation of the authors in question as to the treatment of\r\n  oxyuriasis is concerned, it must be energetically directed to the\r\n  employment of local measures for the intestine; they maintain that\r\n  the use of enemata would be irrational, and that it is astonishing\r\n  that this method has been able to maintain its standing down to the\r\n  present day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*HIRUDINEI* (Leeches).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only one of the leeches that comes under consideration from the\r\nclinical point of view is _Limnatis nilotica_ (_Hæmopsis sanguisuga_),\r\nwhich obtains access to the mouth with drinking water, and becomes\r\nlodged, even in the case of man, in the pharynx, larynx, trachea,\r\nœsophagus and nose.\r\n\r\nAmongst the causes of severe hæmorrhage from the pharynx Jurasz[982]\r\nmentions the occurrence of leeches in that region: in Northern Europe\r\nthis must be accounted one of the greatest of rarities, whilst at\r\nall times in southern countries, such as South Italy, Spain, Greece,\r\nAlgiers, Tunis and Egypt, it appears to have been more frequent.\r\nEven the physicians of antiquity had much to say about it. Upon the\r\noccurrence of blood-stained expectoration, Hippocrates recommends\r\nthe oral cavity to be examined to see whether a leech is not present\r\nin it. Galen speaks of hæmatemesis due to the presence of leeches in\r\nthe pharynx and stomach. Similar mention is found in the writings of\r\nCelsus, Asclepiades, Scribonius Largus, Dioscorides, Aëtius, Oribasius,\r\nPaulus Aegineta and others. In recent times, Cortial[983] has published\r\nobservations relating to this subject which he had the opportunity of\r\nmaking in Constantine. Palazzolo[984] also in Sicily found leeches\r\nin two cases in the pharynx, in one case on the posterior wall, in\r\nthe other in the crypt over the left tonsil. According to Roset,[985]\r\nleeches adhere by preference behind the uvula, simulating hæmatemesis\r\nand hæmoptysis, and the persistent hæmorrhages they give rise to may\r\nlead to severe anæmia. Leeches are found in still greater frequency in\r\nthe larynx than in the pharyngeal cavity. Huber[986] records several\r\nobservations of this kind in his historical and therapeutical study. In\r\nthe case of a man, aged 64, Ramon de la Sota y Lastra[987] observed a\r\nleech on the nodulus epiglottidis; this was removed with the forceps.\r\nIn the case recorded by Photiades,[988] a leech had remained adherent\r\nto the vocal cord for more than twenty-two days. Maissurianz[989]\r\nrecords two such cases: in one the leech had remained in the sinus\r\nmorgagni for three weeks, in the other in the same place for ten\r\ndays. The case recorded by Schmolitschew[990] is an interesting one;\r\nit was that of a woman who for four days had suffered from violent\r\nhæmoptysis, the cause of which was a leech that was fixed on the\r\nlaryngeal wall of the epiglottis close above the vocal cords. In his\r\ncase (that of a soldier), Godet[991] was forced to perform thyrotomy\r\nto remove the leech from the larynx. Ficano[992] removed a live leech\r\nwith the forceps from the lower laryngeal cavity in a man, aged 30.\r\nMassei[993] reports a similar case. The case reported by Winternitz\r\nand Karbinski[994] was that of a peasant girl, aged 16, who suffered\r\nfrom coughing, hoarseness, and blood-stained expectoration; a leech\r\nhad lodged on the root of the epiglottis. Aubert[995] removed a leech\r\nfrom the larynx of a woman after the performance of tracheotomy.\r\nSeifert[996] reports three cases: in the first the leech had become\r\nfixed to the left vocal cord, in the second it was found in the\r\nlower laryngeal cavity, and in the third on the border of the left\r\nligamentum aryepiglotticum. Leone[997] has published the case of a\r\nleech in the larynx, Martin[998] two cases with the leech lodged in the\r\nlower laryngeal cavity, Berthoud[999] a similar case, Palazzolo[1000]\r\ntwo such cases, Panzat[1001] one case (lower laryngeal cavity).\r\nMoucharinski[1002] reports a case in which the leech had stayed more\r\nthan twenty days in the larynx. Martin[1003] easily removed a leech\r\nfrom the posterior portion of the vocal cord with the forceps. Vieus\r\nand Nepeon[1004] record a case of a leech in the larynx. It is quite\r\nexceptional for leeches to gain access to the trachea; cases of this\r\nkind have been recorded by Aubert,[1005] Vicano,[1006] Ridola[1007] and\r\nTapin[1008] (the leech was firmly fixed to the bifurcation and caused\r\ncoughing, hæmoptysis and attacks of asphyxia; it was easily removed by\r\nthe aid of a tracheal tube). Now and then leeches are found in the nose.\r\n\r\n[982] Jurasz, Heymann’s “Handb. d. Laryng. u.

A medical man ordered the application of a leech to the\r\nanterior portion of the nostril. Owing to the carelessness of the\r\nsurgeon the leech crawled right into the nose; it was impossible to\r\nextract the leech or to kill it, and it produced a severe hæmorrhage\r\nwhich led to the death of the patient within two days. In a case\r\nrecorded by Sinclair,[1010] a leech, _Hæmopsis sanguisuga_, gained\r\naccess to the nose of a boy, aged 3; it remained there a fortnight;\r\nit caused frequent attacks of epistaxis and in the end it was removed\r\nby means of forceps. Condorelli-Francaviglia[1011] records a case in\r\nwhich severe epistaxis was caused by a leech which had probably entered\r\nthe anterior portion of the left nostril by way of the pharynx and\r\nbecome tightly fixed there. It was seen by posterior rhinoscopy, and\r\nwas removed from in front by means of slightly curved forceps. Sota\r\ny Lastra[1012] mentions the occurrence of leeches in the nose, and\r\nKeng[1013] reports the case of nasal obstruction from a leech. The\r\nremoval of leeches is effected by means of injections or by the direct\r\nsprinkling of salt or acid solutions on their bodies, which brings\r\nabout their detachment. When possible a previous attempt should be made\r\nto seize them with forceps so as to make their immediate extraction\r\npossible. The species of Hæmadipsa (Looss[1014]) live in tropical\r\nregions in moist places on the ground or in the jungle. They climb\r\nbushes and even trees with astonishing rapidity upon the approach of\r\nlarger animals and also of man (whom they clearly recognize from the\r\nvibration of the ground caused by footsteps). From thence they let\r\nthemselves fall on their victims to suck their blood. Their bites are\r\ngenerally painless, and of themselves not dangerous, but if they are\r\nunusually numerous they rapidly accumulate on the body in large numbers\r\nand give rise to marked debility and, if the wound become infected, to\r\nsevere complications and even death. On the other hand, under careful\r\ntreatment the wounds heal easily and fairly rapidly.\r\n\r\n[1009] Lusitanus, _see_ Seifert in Heymann’s “Handb.,” p. 599.\r\n\r\n[1010] Sinclair, _Brit. Med.

Mense, i, p. 194.\r\n\r\nFirm leather and firmly adhering clothes afford no certain protection\r\nagainst the attacks of these leeches, as they know how to force\r\nthemselves with extraordinary rapidity through the narrowest\r\ninterstices between the clothes and thus gain access to the skin.\r\nWhen they have sucked their fill--and this may take several hours to\r\naccomplish--they fall off of themselves. To effect an earlier removal\r\ndrops of irritative or corrosive fluids are employed (salt solutions,\r\nacids, etc.). Tearing away the leech by force should be avoided, as in\r\nthis way portions of the leech’s body may be left behind in the wound\r\nand inflammation be set up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTHROPODA.\r\n\r\n*Leptus autumnalis* (Grass, Harvest, or Gooseberry Mite[1015]).\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the hot season of the year, that is, during the months of July and\r\nAugust, it is noticed that those people who stray amongst syringa\r\nbushes or who pick gooseberries or kidney beans are attacked by\r\nthe _Leptus autumnalis_. On the uncovered parts of the body there\r\nappear numerous red spots and papules, which itch and burn smartly.\r\nThe itching does not commence diffusely, as in the case of scabies\r\n(MacLennars[1016]), but is limited to the particular points where the\r\nparasite is situated. There are especial outbreaks of itching in the\r\nmorning, arising perhaps from the hatching of ova in the host after\r\nlying in the warmth of the bed.[1017] Leptus frequently provokes\r\ngeneral erythema, eczematization or severe feverish urticaria,\r\nwhich in France is known by the name of fièvre de grain (Mégnieu,\r\nBesnier[1018]). If the individual efflorescences be carefully examined,\r\nthere will be noticed almost without exception a minute boss towards\r\nthe centre, noticeable by its yellowish-red colour. If an attempt is\r\nmade to remove it with the point of a needle or to scrape it off the\r\nsurface, one can often perceive, even with the naked eye, a small\r\nreddish creature moving actively about. The treatment of these very\r\ntroublesome symptoms consists in warm baths with soapy lavages, also\r\nlavages with alcohol, spirit salmiac (G. P.), 5 per cent. carbol or\r\ncreolin solution, diluted vinegar, benzine, emulsions of balsam of\r\nPeru, rubbing in sulphur ointment (Sandwith[1019]); ointments of\r\ncreosote or eucalyptus are recommended. Other grass and grain mites\r\nalso occasionally penetrate the skin of man and produce transitory\r\nbut sometimes very severe eruptions, urticaria and eczema papulosum,\r\nas Geber[1020] and subsequent to him Josai[1021] have reported of the\r\nbarley mite. In sensitive individuals the skin becomes bright red, to\r\na greater or less extent their temperature is raised and frequently\r\nslight febrile affections are present. If the inflammatory skin\r\nsymptoms have reached their culminating point after three or four days\r\nand no fresh complications arise, they only remain for a short while,\r\nthe effects of scratching and pigment spots being left.\r\n\r\n[1015] There is no reason for calling this the gooseberry mite. It is\r\nrarely found on this fruit. The gooseberry mite is _Bryolia pretiosa_.\r\n\r\n[1016] MacLennars, _Lancet_, 1905.\r\n\r\n[1017] [This cannot be the case, as _Leptus autumnalis_ is the larval\r\nform of _Trombidium holosericeum_.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n[1018] Sack, “Handb. d.

The people\r\nmostly attacked are those who cut the hemp harvest in the infected\r\nlocalities, occasionally those who transport it or come into contact\r\nwith it (Looss[1022]). The disease is frequently manifested in the\r\nform of indefinite disturbances of the general condition; it commences\r\ngenerally on the sixth day after the presumed infection with rigors,\r\nheadaches, feeling of weakness, swelling of the lymphatic glands in the\r\nloin or in the arm-pits; in the periphery a black dry scab is formed.\r\nIn addition there is an intense conjunctivitis, and added to symptoms\r\nof fever an exanthema resembling measles that lasts from four to seven\r\ndays. There is frequent delirium and difficulty of hearing which\r\npersist for a long while. Obstinate constipation is a striking symptom.\r\nAt the end of a fortnight, earlier in slighter cases, the fever\r\ncommences to abate and a rapid convalescence sets in. In pregnant women\r\nabortion with fatal issue is frequent. With regard to prophylaxis,\r\nBaelz[1023] recommends as rapid a cultivation of the soil as possible,\r\nwhich has led to a speedy disappearance of the disease in districts\r\nwhere it was once dreaded. Treatment is symptomatic. Japanese do not\r\ntolerate antipyretic drugs as well as Europeans.\r\n\r\n[1022] Looss, “Handbuch d. Tropenkrankh.,” v. Mense, p. 195.\r\n\r\n[1023] Baelz, _Virchow’s Archiv_, lxxviii.\r\n\r\n\r\nDermanyssus gallinæ (avium).\r\n\r\nDuring the day the resort of bird mites is in the droppings and in the\r\nwoodwork, etc., of cages in which canaries, crossbills and parrots are\r\nkept; in the crevices of doors, in the chinks between the board planks\r\nof bedsteads, so that at night they may seek some domestic animal to\r\nsuck the blood and so satisfy their hunger. It is by no means rare\r\nfor young animals, chickens and unfledged pigeons, etc., to perish\r\nin consequence of the great loss of blood. This nocturnal habit of\r\nlife explains why no mites can be found during the day in spite of\r\nthe most careful examination of the human body, to which they may be\r\ntransmitted. On the uncovered parts of the body they not only cause\r\nsevere irritation, but also severe diffuse itching erythema and eczema.\r\nThorough disinfection of the cages by hot solution of caustic potash,\r\nin addition, sprinkling over with tar, red carbolic acid or petroleum,\r\nthoroughly powdering over the birds with flores pyrethræ, washing with\r\nwater containing oleum anisi, washing the walls, doors and bedsteads\r\nwith soap, disinfection of the mattresses, linen and clothes, will\r\nprotect against further infection. In the case of man the disease needs\r\nno special treatment, as the eruptions generally disappear after some\r\ndays. Heinecke[1024] recommends lavages with 1 per cent. carbolic acid\r\nsolution. [_Vide_ also p. 492 in body of this work.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n[1024] Heinecke, _Münch. med. Wochenschr._, 1901.\r\n\r\n[_Dermanyssus hirundinis_, Hermann, is identical with this species. By\r\nfar the best treatment is with paraffin or kerosene oil applied to the\r\nplaces where they pass the day.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIxodes reduvius (ricinus).\r\n\r\nThe female is occasionally transmitted to the human skin, and bores its\r\nproboscis deep into it and sucks itself full of blood. At sensitive\r\npoints of the cutaneous surface--for example over the skin of the\r\npenis--a feeling of severe pain is produced. Buy’s[1025] observations\r\nas to the geographical distribution of the _Ixodinæ_ show that in all\r\nlands in which cattle, horses, sheep and dogs exist, _Ixodinæ_ are to\r\nbe found. Recent observations show that the _Ixodinæ_ play an important\r\npart in the transmission of Hæmosporidia (_vide_ body of work, pp.\r\n493, 494). Sprinkling with oil, vaseline, benzine, ether, petroleum,\r\nnaphtha, turpentine (Jelgenum[1026]), will easily lead to the removal\r\nof the parasite; if the body is torn away with violence and the\r\nproboscis is left sticking in the skin, the presence of the latter will\r\ngive rise to inflammation and suppuration.\r\n\r\n[1025] Buy, “Histoire naturelle et médicale des Ixodes,” “Thèse de\r\nLyon,” 1906.\r\n\r\n[1026] Jelgenum, _Med. Weekblad v. Noord- en Zuid-Nederland_, 1901, i,\r\nNo. 24.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Sarcoptes scabiei* (Scabies).\r\n\r\nThe disease produced by _Sarcoptes scabiei_ shows itself in\r\npolymorphous areas, such as accompany eczema, and are produced on the\r\none hand by the Sarcoptes alone and on the other hand by the scratching\r\nwith the nails. The localization of both kinds of efflorescences is\r\ndifferent from those which are produced by the Sarcoptes; they occur as\r\npapules, vesicles, pustules and mite-tracks, and their usual situation\r\nis between the fingers, on the ulnar border of the hand, on the wrist,\r\non the palm of the hand, on the anterior border of the axilla, on the\r\npenis and at the base of the thorax. The excoriations are situated on\r\nthe forearm, over the thigh, over the abdomen, and may be distributed\r\nin greater or less degree over the whole body; the back and the face\r\nonly remain free. The symptoms consist in violent itching, the onset of\r\nwhich specially takes place at night.\r\n\r\nThe mite-tracks are fine curving lines, curved like *a*, *u*, *c*, or\r\n*s*, which appear as if they had been scratched with a fine needle.\r\nUpon closer examination with the magnifying glass one sees in their\r\ncourse small openings. These openings, in persons who keep themselves\r\nclean, are scarcely coloured; but in patients whose occupations\r\nnecessitate their being associated with coloured or dirty substances,\r\nthey are dark. The length of the tracks varies from some millimetres to\r\n1-1/2 to 2 cm. They are at the one end, where the Sarcoptes is embedded\r\nin the epidermis, widened like a funnel and slightly exfoliated. The\r\ntrack at this point is sharply defined; the mite shows through the\r\nepidermis as a yellowish round point. In the course of the track there\r\ndevelop papulæ, vesicles or pustules, which raise the level of the\r\ntrack. The intensity of these inflammatory appearances depends upon\r\nthe susceptibility of the human individual and upon the capability\r\nof the reaction of the skin. There are people in whom scarcely any\r\ninflammatory symptoms make their appearance; on the other hand there\r\nare some, especially children and lymphatic individuals, in whom severe\r\nimpetiginous ecthymatous pustules, together with their sequelæ, are set\r\nup.\r\n\r\nThe results produced by scratching consist in papules, which usually\r\nbear a small scab of blood, and are arranged in the form of striæ, in\r\neczematous surfaces, weeping or sanguineous scabs, vesicles, pustules,\r\netc. The complications that set in are frequently urticaria and even\r\nfuruncles, lymphangitis and inflammation of the glands, which now and\r\nthen is followed by the formation of abscesses in the glands.\r\n\r\nThe duration of the disease is unlimited; when untreated it leads to a\r\nform of rare occurrence, that of scabies norvegica[1027]; in this the\r\ncollection of crusts and scales, in which a quantity of dead mites,\r\nlarvæ and ova are present, may become colossal.\r\n\r\n[1027] [This is produced by a distinct species, _vide_\r\npp. 519–20.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of scabies abate in the presence of intercurrent acute\r\ndiseases and reappear after the malady is over. The fact has for long\r\ncontributed to the idea of scabies being regarded as a disease capable\r\nof being “driven in” upon the internal organs and forming metastases.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis is rendered certain upon the discovery of a track.\r\nTraces of scratching on the extremities and on the abdomen, papular or\r\npustular efflorescences between the fingers, toes, in the neighbourhood\r\nof the wrist, of the elbow, on the anterior border of the arm-pit, on\r\nthe tuber ischii, in the girdle region, and especially the presence of\r\ndisintegrated tracts over the penis (prepuce and glans), will allow\r\nof the diagnosis being made. Certain occupational eczemas (grocers,\r\nlime-workers, maltsters, bakers and others), also prurigo, must be\r\nborne in mind when diagnosing this disease.\r\n\r\nThe prognosis is always a favourable one. Even after such a long\r\nduration and after such severe symptoms the disease may completely\r\nclear up. There are, however, frequently left behind post-scabious\r\ninflammatous and pruriginous conditions which only yield after\r\nprotracted treatment. Scabiophilia, which persists in certain patients\r\nfor a long time after the scabies has been cured, must here be\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of scabies four points must be kept in view. (1) The\r\nmites and the ova must be killed by the treatment; (2) the treatment\r\nmust have regard to the intensity of the inflammatory symptoms; (3)\r\nthe clothes (body-linen) of the patients must be disinfected; the\r\nbed-linen, the beds and the bedsteads must be cleansed; (4) when a\r\nperson suffers from scabies his entourage must be examined, and all\r\ndiseased conditions treated in the same way as under (3).\r\n\r\nThe treatment (1) should be preceded by a bath with thorough soap\r\nablution, and when the inflammatory symptoms are not too severe,\r\nwith green soap. After the bath the skin is dried and the scabies\r\nremedy proper applied in warmth. Sulphur preparations receive\r\nfirst consideration; among such Vlemingkz’s mixture occupies a\r\nprominent position; this is rubbed in for half an hour by means of a\r\nstrong camel-hair brush, to be followed by another bath and powder\r\napplications after drying. Repeat this method for three days one\r\nafter the other, or for two days, and a third time eight days later.\r\nThe latter method is worthy of recommendation as the ova, which\r\nperhaps resist the parasiticide action, have by this time developed\r\ninto larvæ, and the latter can then be destroyed with certainty. The\r\nremaining sulphur preparations, which are specially employed in the\r\nform of ointments, are more complex, as the ointment should remain\r\non the skin. Helmerisch’s and Wilkinson’s ointments are the kinds\r\nspecially employed. Nagelschmidt[1028] recommends thiopinol as a very\r\nsuitable sulphur preparation in the form of baths or as a 10 or 5 per\r\ncent. ointment in the following way: Upon his reception the patient\r\nis given a thiopinol bath, in which he remains for thirty minutes.\r\nImmediately afterwards 30 to 40 grm. 10 per cent. thiopinol vaseline is\r\ncarefully rubbed in. The rubbing is repeated daily, and the treatment\r\nis concluded on the second to fourth day with a second thiopinol\r\nbath. Thiopinol produces no more irritation than the ordinary sulphur\r\nointments; it is, however, much more penetrative and more capable of\r\nabsorption.\r\n\r\n[1028] Nagelschmidt, _Med. Klin._, 1907, xxxv.\r\n\r\nWe frequently make use of Kaposi’s naphthol ointment, as it renders\r\nthe skin supple, causes proportionately little irritation, and has but\r\nlittle smell. Treatment with balsam of Peru is certainly expensive,\r\nbut in the slighter attacks it is relatively the simplest. We give\r\nthe patient a bath, have him thoroughly dried and rub in 30 to 40 to\r\n50 grm. balsam of Peru carefully and evenly all over, wrap him in\r\na covering of wool, and make him rest in bed for twelve to fifteen\r\nhours, to be followed by a bath with careful cleansing with soap;\r\nthis treatment need rarely be repeated. The balsam of Peru can be\r\napplied undiluted for the rubbings or mixed with ung. glycerini, or\r\nresorbin or glycerine in equal parts. [Norman Walker uses balsam of\r\nPeru 1/2 oz. dissolved in rectified spirit; to be painted on with a\r\nbrush.]--J. P. S. The manufacturers name the undiluted product of\r\nthe active constituent of balsam of Peru, benzoic acid benzyl-ester,\r\nPeruscabin. For the treatment of scabies it is recommended by\r\nSachs[1029] that it should only be administered when mixed with ricinus\r\noil, under the name of Peru oil, in applications repeated three times\r\nwithin thirty-six hours.\r\n\r\n[1029] Sachs, _Deutsch. med. Wochenschr._, 1900.\r\n\r\nSack[1030] also considers Peru oil a non-irritant, effectual, pleasant,\r\ninodorous and non-staining drug. But he only allows the applications\r\nto be used every twelve hours for three to four consecutive days\r\n(altogether 200 to 300 grm. of Peru oil are requisite), and after\r\nthe sixth or seventh rubbing a bath should be taken with the use\r\nof Dutch soap. Juliusberg[1031] considers this treatment specially\r\nsuited for private practice. Another modern drug is epicarin\r\n([Beta]-oxy-naphthyl-ortho-oxy-meta-tolyol acid); this is applied in 10\r\nto 20 per cent. ointments (Pfeiffenberger[1032]), epicarin 7·0 grm.,\r\ncretæ alb. 2·0 grm., vasel. flavi 30·0 grm., lanolin 15·0 grm.,\r\naxungia poric. 45·0 grm. (Rille[1033]); epicarin 15·0 grm., sapon.\r\nvirid. 5·0 grm., axung. poric. 100·0 grm., cretæ alb. 10·0 grm.\r\n(Kraus[1034]); for children, epicarin 5·0 grm., lanolin 90·0 grm.,\r\nol. olivar. 10·0 grm. (Kaposi[1035]). Siebert[1036] lays stress upon\r\nthe odourlessness and colourlessness of epicarin ointment as a strong\r\nreason for its use, and points out that it is a harmless drug, the\r\naction of which is certain. Endermol (salicylic acid ointment) has\r\na destructive action on the mites even in a 0·1 per cent. ointment\r\n(Wolters,[1037] Demitsch[1038]); it is, however, very expensive and\r\nnot wholly free from danger; and the same applies to nicotiana soap\r\n(Taenzer,[1039] Schumann[1040]).\r\n\r\n[1030] Sack, “Handb. d.

Veiel[1041] assumes that\r\nthe hair follicle mite has no connection either with the formation of\r\ncomedones or even with sebaceous gland disease. Kaposi[1042] considers\r\nthat they cause no disease in man and cannot be regarded as a cause of\r\nacne. Saalfeld[1043] clearly adheres to the same standpoint, similarly\r\nso Jessner,[1044] who, when discussing comedones, makes no mention of\r\nacne of hair follicle mites. Weyl[1045] and Geber[1046] adhere to the\r\nopinion that the presence of a Demodex in man in contradistinction\r\nto its presence in animals possesses absolutely no pathogenic\r\ninfluence. On the other hand de Amicis,[1047] Majochi,[1048] and\r\nDubreuilh[1049] report single cases of pronounced circumscribed clear\r\nbrown pigmentations which they attribute to _Demodex folliculorum_.\r\nIn all these cases, moreover, as regards localization the affection\r\nhad a certain resemblance to pityriasis versicolor; nevertheless,\r\nin the scales separated off with the scalpel no fungi were found,\r\nbut on the other hand Demodices in moderate quantity. In his earlier\r\ncases Majochi has seen the Demodex in the secretion from meibomian\r\nglands and had claimed it to be the excitant of chalazion and, as\r\nMibelli[1050] did, considered it to be the cause of some diseases of\r\nthe eyelids. Ivers[1051] found the parasite in 69 per cent. of normal\r\nborders of the eyelids, and attributes a pathological signification to\r\nit. Hünsche[1052] and Mulder[1053] arrive at the same conclusions; in\r\nthe light of their investigations the Demodex is found as a constant\r\naccessory--certainly not in the meibomian glands, as it is limited\r\nonly to the internal part of the hair follicle. Lewandowsky[1054]\r\nconsiders that it can hardly be demonstrated at present that the same\r\nparasite which in individual specimens causes no symptoms is capable of\r\nproducing pathological conditions when markedly increased in numbers.\r\n\r\n[1041] Veiel, v.

If the eyelids should be affected with blepharitis\r\ndue to the presence of Demodex in large numbers, epilation and\r\nadministration of a parasiticide is recommended.\r\n\r\n\r\nDemodex folliculorum canis.\r\n\r\nTransmission from dog to man is in any case very rare, and by many\r\nits occurrence is generally doubted. Nevertheless Gruby[1055] and\r\nRemak[1056] claim that it is transmissible--an opinion which has also\r\nbeen shared by Neumann[1057] and Zürn.[1058] The latter saw in the\r\ncase of a married couple who had the care of mangy dogs the onset of\r\ndiseased areas on their hands and feet, which were like those on the\r\ndogs and contained the same parasites.\r\n\r\n[1055] Gruby, quoted by Lewandowsky.\r\n\r\n[1056] Remak, _ibid._\r\n\r\n[1057] Neumann, _ibid._\r\n\r\n[1058] Zürn, _ibid._\r\n\r\nA. Babes[1059] also reports several observations which go to show that\r\npersons who, to some extent, have been shown to have been in contact\r\nwith mange-stricken dogs have been attacked by a scabies-like eruption\r\nlocalized over the thorax, abdomen, back and extremities; large numbers\r\nof Demodices were found in the follicular pustules. Lewandowsky[1060]\r\nreports one case--that of an Italian workman, who suffered from an\r\noutbreak on the face, like impetigo; there was crust formation and\r\nat the edge of the crusts the epidermis appeared like a narrow row\r\nor border of vesicles. A small portion of the covering of the row of\r\nvesicles was lifted off, and after slight warming examined in 40 per\r\ncent. liquor potassæ. In this a large number of animal parasites of\r\nthe Demodex group were found, and without doubt _Demodex folliculorum\r\ncanis_ alone. Hünsche[1061] assumes that _Demodex folliculorum_\r\npenetrates into the tissues and produces abscesses.\r\n\r\n[1059] Babes, _ibid._\r\n\r\n[1060] Lewandowsky, _Deutsch. med.

After the regular use of xeroform as a\r\npowder application, the affection cleared up within fourteen days.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSECTA.\r\n\r\n*Pediculus capitis* (Pediculus capitis) (Head Louse).\r\n\r\nWe find _Pediculus capitis_ in very young children and in others\r\nmore grown up to be the incessant and frequent cause of impetiginous\r\ncrust-forming eczemas. It is more frequent in girls than in boys. In\r\nfamilies it is endemic, in schools epidemic, but it also occurs in fair\r\nfrequency in female adults (servant maids, waitresses) who may pay\r\nlittle attention to bodily cleanliness. The puncture of the parasites\r\nsets up a severe irritation, which leads to violent scratching. The\r\nconsequences of this are the formation of nodules and pustules, crusts\r\nand “weeping” patches; the hairs become felted and the final clinical\r\npicture is that of plica polonica. The conditions of irritation which\r\nare produced by these parasites and then by the scratchings of the\r\nimpetiginous, and frequently the very severe suppurative processes\r\nof the hair-bed, lead to swellings in the neck and sometimes even to\r\nglandular suppurations. The eczematous processes not infrequently\r\nextend over the face, the neck and the thorax. Blepharitis and\r\nconjunctivitis may be due to _Pediculus capitis_.\r\n\r\nThe means of infection are often very remarkable. Transmission from\r\none individual to another certainly often occurs, but infection may\r\ntake place in railway carriages and in other ways. A case under the\r\nobservation of a colleague in Frankfort is a most remarkable one: he\r\ndiagnosed pediculosis as the cause of a head eczema occurring among the\r\nchildren of one of the best families there. The infection took place\r\nthrough dolls adorned with human hair, in which the presence of nits\r\ncould be demonstrated.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis of _Pediculus capitis_ is not difficult to make when\r\nthe hairs and hairy scalp are carefully examined for nits and living\r\nparasites. In better families it is a good plan to point out the\r\n_corpora delicti_ to their possessors and to make them aware of the\r\npossible sources of infection.\r\n\r\nAs regards treatment, lotions of sabadill vinegar are recommended;\r\nin slighter cases these are quite sufficient. In severe cases cure\r\nwill not result unless dressings of petroleum, naphthol ointment (5\r\nto 10 per cent.) and balsam of Peru be applied. In the case of plica\r\npolonica, the hair must be cut quite short (even in adults) so as to\r\ncontrol matting of the hair. To get rid of nits from hair that is not\r\nmatted, careful combing and washing with strongly alkaline fluids or\r\nwith hot vinegar is suitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Pediculus vestimenti* (Clothes Louse).\r\n\r\nThe clothes louse attacks adults by preference, and with especial\r\nfrequency old and emaciated persons. It lives in the clothes, but\r\nderives its nourishment from the body. At the moment at which\r\nthe clothes louse inserts its proboscis into the skin the person\r\nexperiences a slight sting, which, however, at once ceases to hurt.\r\nIf the body of the louse is sucked full of blood it falls off and the\r\nindividual has rest from it for a time. A wheal develops around the\r\nhæmorrhagic area of the bitten spot and itches severely. The itching\r\ngoes on until the eruption is scratched all over. This is followed by\r\ncrust formation. When many parasites are present the itching reflexes\r\nbecome more severe, and the patients scratch themselves considerably\r\nand make long marks at those places where the Pediculi have been.\r\nThe localization of the scratching effects is characteristic,\r\ncorresponding with folds between portions of clothing (regions between\r\nthe shoulder-blades, wrist and neck). If the condition lasts for a\r\nmonth, the scratching effects extend over the whole body, and secondary\r\nefflorescences become associated with it, such as pustules, ulcers and\r\neczemas. Intermediate between this we find cicatrices and pigmentation,\r\nthe latter under certain circumstances extending over the whole body.\r\nSulla, Herod, Cardinal Dupet, Philip II, and others are said to have\r\ndied from louse disease. That even at present many human beings are\r\nexposed to the danger of being devoured by lice is a fact that we have\r\nhad the opportunity of observing on several occasions. Only to record\r\none instance, a man, aged 65, was received into our clinic some time\r\nago in an absolutely neglected condition (he had been staying for some\r\nweeks in a stable, lying on a wretched bed). The whole of the surface\r\nof his body was covered with countless furuncles, of greater and less\r\nsize, which had partly become changed into undermined ulcers. Over the\r\nulcers and beneath their undermined edges Pediculi were swarming.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Phthirius inguinalis* (_Pediculus pubis_) (Crab Louse).\r\n\r\nThe transmission of these parasites generally takes place during\r\ncoitus, and therefore they especially occur in the pubes. It is\r\npossible also that transmission is effected through dirty clothes and\r\nbed-linen and privy seats.[1062] Starting from the pubes the animals\r\ncrawl out over the other parts of the body provided with hairs to the\r\nabdominal wall and the thorax (so far as these parts are furnished with\r\nthick hair) to the arm-pits, the beard, the eyebrows; not, however, to\r\nthe hair of the head, or rarely so; among our numerous cases we have\r\nnever met with an example of the crab louse attacking the hair of the\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n[1062] [A case of infection through a dirty station privy in\r\nSwitzerland came to my knowledge in 1899, and numbers of pediculi were\r\nfound there.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\nThe irritation produced by the crab louse is extraordinarily severe,\r\nespecially during the night, as the warmth of the bed incites the lice\r\nto active sucking. In consequence of the violent scratching indulged\r\nin, eczemas are set up at the points attacked, and these often spread\r\nto the neighbouring parts not covered with hair.\r\n\r\nOf special interest is the onset of maculæ cæruleæ (tâches bleues) in\r\nsome persons affected with crab lice (people disposed to sweating seem\r\nto be peculiarly liable to these). They consist in pale blue patches\r\nof various size and shape, varying from that of a hemp-seed to that\r\nof a lentil, and again to that of a nail in size and form. These are\r\nfound over the cutaneous surface of the abdomen, thorax and thigh,\r\nand are often only seen by a good lateral illumination. Duguet[1063]\r\nconsiders that the condition is a toxic erythema, that it is set up,\r\non the occasion of the bite of the parasite penetrating the skin, by\r\nthe poisonous substance derived from it. Oppenheim[1064] considers\r\nthat it is a colouring substance that is formed in the salivary glands\r\nof the parasites, and which penetrates the skin when the insects\r\nbite, and thus forms the maculæ cæruleæ. We have on several occasions\r\nemulated the experiment of Duguet (trituration in a mortar of crab\r\nlice freshly taken from the human body and inoculating the mass thus\r\nobtained beneath the skin), and have similarly been enabled to produce\r\nthe maculæ cæruleæ experimentally, but we have certainly been unable\r\nto determine which of the hypotheses is the correct one, the toxic\r\nerythema or the colouring substance inhibition theory.\r\n\r\n[1063] Duguet, _Annal. de Derm._, II Sér., i.\r\n\r\n[1064] Oppenheim, “Handb. d. Hautkrankh.,” v. Mraček, 1907.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis of phthirasis is very easy, for either the sexually\r\nmature parasites or the nits are found on the hairs.\r\n\r\nAs regards treatment, grey ointment is regarded as a generally useful\r\napplication; it gives rise, however, to a slight eczema of the\r\ngenitals, especially in males, when injudiciously used. Geber[1065]\r\nrecommends petroleum or balsam of Peru, Oppenheim[1066] a 1 per\r\ncent. sublimate solution for lotions, or a mixture of equal parts\r\nof petroleum and benzine when the sublimate cannot be borne. The\r\nuse of a 5 per cent. ointment with hydrarg. oxid. flavum is worth\r\nconsidering in treatment of pediculosis of the eyebrows and eyelashes.\r\nThe simplest method of treatment, and one with a radical effect, is\r\nthat by sulphuric ether recommended by Thomer.[1067] It certainly\r\nproduces a sharp burning sensation, but the living parasites and nits\r\nare destroyed in one sitting. We prefer ether lotions as a rule, and\r\nwe thoroughly rub the affected parts with a pad of wadding well soaked\r\nwith the ether. The dead parasites and the nits fall on to what lies\r\nbeneath when the rubbing is done thoroughly, and the burning sensation\r\ncaused by the ether only lasts a few minutes.\r\n\r\n[1065] Geber, _see_ Seifert, Lesser’s “Encyclop.,” p. 387.\r\n\r\n[1066] Oppenheim, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\n[1067] Thomer, _see_ Seifert, Lesser’s “Encyclop.,” p. 387.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Cimex (Acanthia) lectularia*[1068] (_Cimex lectularius_) (Bed Bug).\r\n\r\n[1068] _Vide_ genus Cimex, p. 534.\r\n\r\nThe puncture in the skin made by the bed bug gives rise to an\r\nextraordinary amount of severe itching and a burning sensation, and\r\nwhen the skin is sensitive wheals of remarkable size (_urticaria\r\nex cimicibus_). These eruptions that cause such severe itching are\r\nscratched by those attacked, till very soon blood begins to flow, and\r\nthis generally leads to the formation of a dried crust of blood at the\r\npoint of eruption.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis is not always easy, as urticaria arising in other ways\r\nfrequently leads to similar vigorous scratching and formation of\r\ncrusts of dried blood. Men who have some experience in this matter\r\n(for example, commercial travellers), when they are attacked by severe\r\nitching at night, are in the habit of striking a light and searching\r\nin their bed and body-linen for the bugs, in order to be able to hand\r\nover the _corpora delicti_ to the landlord if need be. The assumption\r\nthat the bugs in the East play an actual part in the propagation of\r\ntuberculosis and bubonic plague has been proved by investigations\r\nmade by Nuttall[1069] to be at least very exaggerated if not wholly\r\nwithout foundation. Further investigations may decide how far the bugs\r\nparticipate in the transmission of kala-azar, as is believed by Rogers\r\nto take place.\r\n\r\n[1069] Nuttall, _see_ Sack “Handb.,” v. Mraček, p. 290.\r\n\r\nThe bed bugs must be exterminated by spraying the chinks and joints\r\nin the boards with petroleum and benzine, pulling up the carpets and\r\ncleansing the bedsteads. For the treatment of the bite itself the\r\nmethods recommended as an antidote against insects’ stings in general\r\nare suitable: 2 per cent. carbol vaseline (Rosenbach[1070]), thymol\r\ndissolved in spirit (1 in 50[1071]), æthrol or deci-æthrol, form-æthrol\r\n(manufactured by Dr. Nordlinger, Flörsheim a. /M.), formol[1072]\r\n(formol 15 parts, xylol 5 parts, acetone 44 parts, Canada balsam 1\r\npart), with the aid of a pad of wadding placed over the part bitten,\r\nlavages with vinegar, citron juice and spirit of salmiac.\r\n\r\n[1070] Rosenbach, _Therap. Monatsh._, 1903.\r\n\r\n[1071] _Leipzig. med. Monatsh._, 1907, vi.\r\n\r\n[1072] _Chemist and Druggist_, August 25, 1906.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Pulex irritans* (Human Flea).\r\n\r\nThe bite of the flea produces a slight discharge of blood about the\r\nsize of a pin’s head, which rapidly becomes surrounded with a circular\r\narea similar to a patch of roseola. The redness fades away after a\r\nlonger or shorter while (several hours), whilst the discharge of\r\nblood is to be seen for one or two days longer. In dirty people the\r\nwhole body may be covered with such discharges of blood. Individuals\r\nwith very delicate, sensitive skin, especially small children, show\r\ntrue wheal formation at the site of the bite. In certain cases there\r\ndevelops from one such single bite an urticaria that extends over a\r\nlarge part of the body. The manner by which an irritating substance is\r\nintroduced into the skin upon biting by the bed bug and also by the\r\nflea is clear. The bite is followed by a feeling of itching, which is\r\nliable to rob nervous persons of their sleep. Sensitive individuals\r\nare upset even by the fleas moving over the surface of the skin during\r\ntheir rest at night.\r\n\r\nTreatment consists in extreme cleanliness, capture of the parasites,\r\nsprinkling the body and bed-linen with insect powders. The fleas are\r\ndifficult to remove from barracks, schools and hospitals.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Dermatophilus* (*Sarcopsylla*) *penetrans* (Sand Flea).\r\n\r\nThe fertilized females penetrate into the skin with their heads, and\r\nhere they swell, in consequence of the numerous and growing eggs and\r\nlarvæ, to a white ball the size of a small pea, on which the head is\r\nrecognizable only as a small brown point.\r\n\r\nIn this way a small brown tumour arises, over which, at the\r\ncommencement, the skin is not reddened; after some days, however, it\r\nbecomes inflamed; in the centre of it a small opening is seen. If the\r\nparasite is not extracted the skin that lies over it becomes destroyed\r\nby suppuration, and thus becomes removed. At the commencement the\r\npart affected itches, with increasing inflammation; the symptoms of\r\nirritation become more severe and may amount to actual pain. If the\r\nsmall suppurative processes be neglected, inflammation and gangrenous\r\nand septic processes may arise. The region of the body sought out by\r\npreference by the sand flea is the sole of the foot, the toes, under\r\nthe free ends of the nails and the digito-plantoid folds--more rarely\r\nthe scrotum, thigh and other parts are attacked (Scheube[1073]). The\r\nnumber of parasites found on one person may amount to several hundreds.\r\n\r\n[1073] Scheube, “Die Krankh. d. warmer Länder,” 1896.\r\n\r\nTreatment consists in the removal of the parasites from the skin with\r\na needle or a small sharp knife and the application of a bandage.\r\nRubbing the feet with copaiba or Peru balsam, sprinkling them with\r\ninsect powder, or washing them with bay rum (Berger[1074]) acts as a\r\nprophylactic or removes the irritation of the skin produced by the\r\nparasites.\r\n\r\n[1074] Berger, _Therap. Monatsh._, April, 1907.\r\n\r\n\r\nMyiasis.\r\n\r\nUnder the name of myiasis we designate the complex symptoms which\r\nparasitic dipterous larvæ give rise to in man (Braun), and we conceive\r\nunder the term myiasis externa (dermatosa s. cutanea) all lesions of\r\nthe human integument caused by fly larvæ and of the cavities covered\r\nwith mucosa therewith connected, such as the external auditory meatus,\r\nthe oro-nasal cavity, the urethra and vagina. The occurrence of\r\ndipterous larvæ in the digestive tract is named myiasis intestinalia or\r\ninterna.\r\n\r\n\r\nMyiasis externa.\r\n\r\nThe larvæ of a species of fly belonging to the _Muscidæ_, _Lucilia\r\nmacellaria_,[1075] are found in relative frequency in the nose,\r\nespecially in America and India.[1076] Riley[1077] has stated that the\r\nscrew-worm of Central America and of the United States is nothing else\r\nthan the larva of _Lucilia macellaria_, and also that the Brazilian\r\nfly named “berna” may be no other than _Lucilia macellaria_. Their\r\noffspring may set up inflammatory disturbances in the soft tissues of\r\nman. This fly has a wide distribution, from the Argentine Republic to\r\nCanada, also in the British portions of the East Indies, where the\r\ndisease is named “peenash.” This word is derived from the Sanskrit,\r\nand is said to be a collective name for all diseases of the nose.\r\nLahory[1078] states that within a period of nine years ninety-one\r\ncases of “peenash” occurred in Allyghar, two of these ending fatally.\r\n_Lucilia macellaria_ is not at all timid but bold, like the house-flies\r\nand blue-bottles, its relatives. It not only lives at no great distance\r\nfrom human dwellings, and forces its way into villas and country\r\nhouses, but even attacks its victims without awaking them from their\r\nsleep. Although this species shows a certain preference for nasal\r\ncavities affected with catarrh or pus (v. Frantzius[1079]), and also\r\nthe external auditory meatus, as well as ulcerated or wounded parts of\r\nthe body, and even badly ulcerated skin carcinoma (Lutz[1080]), it is\r\nnot a rare thing for it to penetrate into one of the above-mentioned\r\ncavities rapidly to deposit its eggs, without these parts having\r\nbeen previously affected. The report also of Conil,[1081] in which\r\nthese flies bear the name of _Calliphora anthropophaga_[1082] is an\r\ninteresting one. Probably it was the same species of Muscid in the\r\ncases of myiasis nasi observed by von Tengemann, Delasiauve,[1083]\r\nWeber,[1084] Mankiewicz,[1085] and Kirschmann.[1086] In the case\r\nrecorded by Prima,[1087] and in that recorded by Britton,[1088] the\r\nissue was a fatal one; in the latter the larvæ escaped through the\r\npharynx and nose; the hyoid bone and the soft parts of the palate\r\nwere destroyed, the speech and power of swallowing were hindered.\r\nAt the _post-mortem_ extensive destruction of the internal nose was\r\nfound, so that the nasal bones could only be kept in their position\r\nby the aid of the external skin. Even during life 227 larvæ escaped.\r\nSimilar destructive processes were found in the case communicated\r\nby Richardson.[1089] In two cases reported by Schmidt[1090] 300 and\r\n350 larvæ were respectively removed from the nose, and the patients\r\nrecovered. Wolinz[1091] found his patient had lost consciousness,\r\nand that in the pus filling up the entrances to the nose numerous\r\nlarvæ were moving; recovery followed. In the case communicated by\r\nAdler,[1092] more than 150 larvæ escaped from the nose of an old man.\r\nCurran[1093] states that people suffering from “peenash” frequently\r\ndie from meningitis. The cases reported by Pierre[1094] related to\r\nthe forms of severe myiasis frequently to be observed in Guiana. In a\r\npatient who was suffering from typhus (? typhoid), Douglas[1095] found\r\nthe conjunctival sacs full of larvæ; in two other individuals the nasal\r\ncavities were attacked.\r\n\r\n[1075] [_Chrysomyia macellaria_, p. 587.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n[1076] [_C. macellaria_, Fabricius, the screw-worm fly, is found in\r\ntropical America and the West Indies.

In a case reported by Carrière[1098] an abscess of the\r\nnasal septum was produced by the larvæ of flies; Chiodi[1099] reports\r\nseven cases of myiasis due to _Lucilia macellaria_; among these was\r\na case of rhinitis myiatica, in which a cerebral abscess leading to\r\na fatal termination developed, being produced by the migration of\r\na larva into the brain.

Persons\r\nsuffering from ozæna are rendered the most liable to danger as the\r\npenetrating odour entices the flies in tropical countries with intense\r\nfrequency, so much so that v. Frantzius does not consider this myiasis\r\nas an independent disease, but as a complication of ozæna of frequent\r\noccurrence in warm countries. The infection is so far of interest in\r\nits nature, in that it only takes place during the day. The fly is on\r\nthe wing only by day when the sun is shining, and consequently only\r\ndeposits its eggs at this time. Therefore persons suffering from ozæna\r\nare principally exposed to the danger of being pursued by the flies\r\nwhen they succumb to sleep during the mid-day hours in the open or in\r\ndwellings that are not closed up.\r\n\r\n[1108] [And the other species, of course, must be included\r\nhere.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n[1109] [Concerning Europe and India, _macellaria_ does not\r\noccur.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\nHeadache is the symptom which most troubles the patients. It extends\r\nover the whole cranium and persists uninterruptedly, with more or less\r\nsevere periods. Violent headaches in the frontal and buccal regions are\r\nalmost always present in this complaint; they are experienced either\r\nonly on one side or on both simultaneously; sometimes the pain is\r\nextended to the lower jaw and region of the neck, following the whole\r\nextent of the trigeminal nerve. The inflammation of the nasal mucosa\r\nproduced by the penetration into it of the larvæ extends right into the\r\nfrontal sinus and antrum. Simultaneously the patients, at the height\r\nof their trouble, suffer from persistent sleeplessness and severe\r\nvertigo, so that they reel and cannot walk straight; excessive sneezing\r\nalways sets in at the commencement. The larvæ immediately spread over\r\nthe nasal mucosa to seek a place suitable to feed, and irritate the\r\nnasal mucous membrane by the tickling sensation they produce. Later the\r\npatients frequently sneeze when the maggots move to and fro.\r\n\r\nOne very characteristic symptom consists in the peculiar swelling of\r\nthe face, which is extended either over the whole or only one half of\r\nit, and may alternate with attacks of erysipelas (Brokaw[1110]).\r\n\r\n[1110] Brokaw, _see_ Seifert, in Heymann’s “Handb.,” p. 595.\r\n\r\nThe discharge from the nose is of special diagnostic value. It\r\nconsists of a blood-stained serous matter or blood-stained fluid,\r\nwhich is perpetually trickling from one or both nostrils. The larvæ\r\nespecially choose the anterior portions of the nasal cavity, where they\r\ncan be seen lying in groups together at the base of the choanæ. The\r\nconsequence of this is that the soft palate becomes intensely swollen,\r\nand this in turn makes swallowing very difficult; speech is impeded,\r\nand the voice acquires a nasal intonation. Symptoms of fever become\r\nmore or less pronounced according to the number of larvæ present,\r\nand according to the nature and constitution of the individual. The\r\nappetite is in abeyance throughout the whole duration of the illness,\r\nand sometimes there is the onset of slight attacks of diarrhœa.\r\n\r\nIf the larvæ are not removed in good time there follows excessive\r\ndestruction of the interior of the nose and of the turbinals; and the\r\nwhole nasal framework undergoes disintegration, frequently, too, the\r\nvelum palati, so that the larvæ come into sight in the oral cavity.\r\nIndividuals thus severely attacked succumb through exhaustion,\r\nsymptoms of meningitis (cerebral abscess) or septicæmia (Prima[1111]).\r\nTwenty-one out of thirty-eight cases recorded (collected) by\r\nMaillard[1112] died.\r\n\r\n[1111] Prima, “Thèse de Paris,” 1881.\r\n\r\n[1112] Maillard, “Thèse de Montpellier,” 1870.\r\n\r\nThe method of prophylaxis is self-evident from what has been stated.\r\nOn bright summer days neither the healthy nor those suffering from\r\ndiseases of the nose should sleep during the day-time in the open or in\r\npublic habitations; sufferers from nasal diseases should pay special\r\nattention to this.\r\n\r\nTreatment consists in the removal of the larvæ; this, however, is not\r\nalways easy.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the methods which have proved to be effectual in\r\nthe destruction of living larvæ and their expulsion from the nose,\r\nstrongly smelling and easily diluted fluids come first, such as\r\nalcohol, eau-de-Cologne, and ether, which should kill the creatures\r\nwhen injected into the nostrils. The earlier physicians, such as\r\nSalzmann,[1113] Honold,[1114] and Henkel,[1115] have seen good\r\nresults from the use of these methods, whilst Mankiewicz[1116] and\r\nGoldstein[1117] obtained no results whatever. Kimball’s[1118] careful\r\ninvestigations have shown that a decoction of bitter herbs recommended\r\nby Behrends[1119] (tansy, wormwood) have just as little effect as the\r\ntobacco decoction employed by Boerhave[1120] and Kilgour.[1121] The\r\nsternutatories employed by the older physicians are entirely neglected.\r\nDelasiauve[1122] experienced good results from the inhalation of the\r\nsmoke of paper cigarettes, which were soaked with a solution of 2·0\r\npot. arsenic in 30·0 distilled water. Whilst, according to Kimball,\r\nbalsam of Peru had no effect on the larvæ, Mankiewicz succeeded in\r\nremoving the larvæ from the nose with the help of that drug. Turpentine\r\nsteam or mixtures of turpentine employed by Indian physicians have not\r\nbeen very effectual according to Moore,[1123] Kimball and Goldstein.\r\nSuccess has been attained in some cases by the use of insufflations\r\nof calomel (Roura,[1124] Cerna,[1125] Schmidt[1126]) or of iodoform\r\n(Pascal[1127]). Joseph[1128] recommends concentrated alum solution\r\nbeing sniffed up into the nose as very effectual. Sublimate and\r\ncarbol solutions do not appear to be very successful (Kimball, Moore,\r\nGoldstein), whilst benzine inhalations (Pierre[1129]) have shown better\r\nresults. Scheppegrell[1130] strongly recommends injections of oil which\r\nkill the larvæ, while it is perfectly harmless to the nasal mucosa.\r\nCesare[1131] employed nasal lavages with solutions of salicylate of\r\nsoda with good results, and Calamida[1132] lavages with physiological\r\nsaline solution. Bresgen[1133] recommends the nose being cocainized\r\nand the larvæ being removed with a pincette. Roorda-Smit[1134]\r\ncocainized the nose, then insufflated calomel and plugged the nose with\r\na gauze tampon dusted with calomel. After two hours fifty-six larvæ\r\ncrawled out along the plug. Continuation of the treatment resulted in a\r\ncomplete cure.\r\n\r\n[1113] Salzmann, _see_ Tiedemann, Mannheim, 1844.\r\n\r\n[1114] Honold, _ibid._\r\n\r\n[1115] Henkel, _ibid._\r\n\r\n[1116] Mankiewicz, _Virchow’s Archiv_, 1868, xliv.\r\n\r\n[1117] Goldstein, _New York Med.

Camphorated\r\ncarbolic solutions are very well spoken of: Grayson[1146] states that\r\nthese kill the larvæ immediately.

Species of the genus\r\nScolopendra (_Myriapoda_), which all shun the light and seek their\r\nfood during the night--which consists of animal and vegetable\r\nsubstances--frequently make their way into the nasal cavities of people\r\nwhen asleep. They are found not only in the nose, but in the accessory\r\ncavities. In the chapter on the “Parasites of the Nose”[1154] we have\r\ncollected striking instances, but we have omitted to mention the\r\nobservation made by Bertrand[1155] (Scolopendra in sinus maxillaris)\r\nand that made by Bergmann[1156] (Scolopendra in sinus frontalis). In\r\nthe same chapter some remarks are made as to the occurrence in the nose\r\nof earwigs, caterpillars, scorpions and termites, as well as of animals\r\nwhich have not been identified.\r\n\r\n[1150] Cheval, _Journ. de Méd. et de Chir._, 1893.\r\n\r\n[1151] [This is the larva of a moth.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n[1152] Bond, _Int.

In one case Vesescu[1157] extracted seven\r\nliving larvæ from the ear with the aid of a thin pair of pincettes.\r\nKöhler[1158] recommends the infusion of drops of ol. terebinth. to\r\ndestroy the larvæ, Quintano[1159] the insufflation of the following\r\npowder: Oxid. hydrarg. rubr., sulfur., āā 1·0 grm., pulv. gi. arab.\r\n8·0 grm.; Lesbini[1160] recommends tincture of iodine. In the case\r\nreported by Henneberg[1161] the larvæ were those of _Lucilia cæsar_.\r\n\r\n[1157] Vesescu, _Riv. stiintelor med._, February, 1906.\r\n\r\n[1158] Köhler, _Monatsschr. f.

In the cases under the\r\nobservation of Schultz-Zeyden[1163] both the eyes of a female tramp\r\nwere destroyed, and quantities of larvæ were also found in the nasal\r\nfossæ and in the ears.\r\n\r\n[1162] Kayser, _Klin. Monatsbl. f. Augenheilk._, 1905.\r\n\r\n[1163] Schultz-Zeyden, _Berl. klin. Wochenschr._, 1906.\r\n\r\nThe Lucilia is found relatively seldom on the cutaneous surface.\r\nHenneberg’s[1164] case was that of a neglected girl, aged 20, in whom\r\ncountless larvæ (_L. cæsar_) were found in a plica polonica; after\r\nthe plica polonica had been removed the scalp was found to be covered\r\nwith a large quantity of ulcers which swarmed with larvæ, large and\r\nsmall. The skin of the trunk was also much macerated and covered with\r\nlarvæ. Death resulted from sepsis; Westenhöffer[1165] remarks on this\r\ncase that a lesion of the head from which the patient had suffered\r\npreviously and the perpetual state of intoxication in which she was\r\nhad probably given rise to the lodgment of the fly larvæ. Whether\r\nthe communications made by Munk[1166] of maggots in the mouth relate\r\nto Lucilia I do not know. Vesescu,[1167] in one case with extensive\r\nulceration and deep fistulæ in the skin, removed 176 larvæ with the\r\npincette. In Roorda-Smit’s[1168] case there were two ulcers in the\r\nneck of a girl, aged 17, and larvæ appeared at their base. After\r\ndusting with calomel and the application of a bandage the next day\r\nfifty-two dead or half-dead larvæ came to light. Recovery took place.\r\nLesbini,[1169] in the case of an old lady, saw numerous larvæ in an\r\nulcer of the leg she was suffering from. Hector’s[1170] case appears to\r\nhave been one of myiasis cutanea provoked by Lucilia.\r\n\r\n[1164] Henneberg, _Berl. med.

In these animals\r\nsmall wounds serve to entice the flies and to supply them with a\r\nsuitable site for the deposition of their eggs. The oral armature of\r\nthe young larvæ renders it easy for them to penetrate not only the\r\nmucosa and cutaneous surface but also intact places in the submucous\r\nconnective tissue. In many localities more than half the herds have\r\nproved to be infected by the flies. The fly only frequents open\r\nspaces and never enters human dwellings, and is so timid that it\r\napproaches man only during sleep; infection, therefore, takes place\r\nonly out of doors, in summer, in clear, warm weather, and only in such\r\nindividuals as sleep in the open air. Individuals are most exposed to\r\nrisk who suffer from catarrhs or inflammations, combined with purulent\r\nsecretions of the nasal cavity (ozæna), or otorrhœa, or ulcers in any\r\nparts of the body accessible to the female fly.\r\n\r\n[1171] Wohlfahrt, “De vermibus per nares excretis,” Norimbergae, 1770.\r\n\r\n[1172] Portschinsky, “Norae Soc. entomolog. Rossicae,” 1875.\r\n\r\nThe frequency and intensity of the infection will be in inverse\r\nproportion to the advance in civilization of the inhabitants, their\r\nidea of cleanliness, their having timely medical aid and the chances\r\nof their being rapidly attended to. On that account the majority of\r\ncases of myiasis (Sarcophaga) are reported from Russia. The literature\r\nof this kind of myiasis nasalis is not very extensive; in addition to\r\nWohlfahrt, Portschinsky and Joseph,[1173] there is a communication by\r\nGerstäcker,[1174] who found fifteen adult larvæ of _S. wohlfahrti_\r\nin the nasal cavity of one man. The larvæ transmitted from Ordruf by\r\nDr. Thomas to Löw,[1175] in Vienna, which were discharged from the\r\nnose of a woman, aged 71, suffering from ozæna, were recognized by\r\nthe well-known dipterologist Braun as belonging to _S. wohlfahrti_.\r\nAmong the cases reported by Joseph, one only affected the nose; it was\r\nthat of a peasant girl, aged 11, who had suffered from ozæna; she had\r\ntravelled on the open road and had there gone to sleep. Severe symptoms\r\nset in and death followed under delirium. In making the _post-mortem_\r\nit was found that the interior of the nose was extensively destroyed by\r\nlarvæ of _S. wohlfahrti_. Powell found Sarcophaga larvæ in two persons\r\nwho had slept in the open air; the larvæ were killed by injections of\r\nchloroform and sublimate. Destruction of the eyes by _S. wohlfahrti_\r\nhas only been observed in a few cases; it is reported by Cloquet[1176]\r\nthat, in the case of a ragman who had lain some time in the fields,\r\nboth eyes were pierced by larvæ. On the outer skin the larvæ of _S.\r\nwohlfahrti_ have been found more than once in inflammatory or festering\r\nareas. Freund[1177] demonstrated that from a five year old child, which\r\nhad suffered for some time from an impetiginous eczema of the skin of\r\nthe head, from two suppurating abscess cavities which extended to the\r\nperiosteum, which was already affected, twenty-one living larvæ were\r\ntaken; rapid healing took place under antiseptic bandaging.\r\n\r\n[1173] Joseph, _Deutsch. med.

One finds that\r\nthe larvæ to obtain protection against the drying of the surface of the\r\nabscess almost incessantly burrow with their heads, first contracting\r\nand then expanding the body, which rises and falls, and keeping the\r\ntail upwards. Owing to these movements producing irritation, increase\r\nof inflammation may ultimately arise, causing erysipelas and cellulitis.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of myiasis nasalis caused by Sarcophaga is the same as\r\nin myiasis caused by Lucilia, and in the other places where found it\r\nis merely a question of the removal of the larvæ and the subsequent\r\nproper treatment of the surface of the abscess. In Northern Nigeria\r\nLelean[1180] found _Auchmeromyia depressa_ to be the cause of myiasis\r\nexterna.[1181]\r\n\r\n[1180] Lelean, _Brit. Med. Journ._, 1904.\r\n\r\n[1181] [Numerous instances of attacks by Auchmeromyia are known and\r\nreferred to under that genus, pp. 593–4. The species referred to here\r\nis not _depressa_, Walker.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of Oestrid larvæ in a human being is very rare, at least\r\nup till now myiasis oestrosa has been very seldom observed in man in\r\nEurope. Whilst the hosts of the _Muscidæ_ comprise a considerable\r\nnumber of warm-blooded animals, on which the larvæ develop, each\r\nspecies of the _Oestridæ_ appears, on the other hand, to have a\r\ndefinite host or some definite hosts of the class Mammalia. No species\r\nof Oestrid is peculiar to man. Although in America, as well as in\r\nEurope, _Oestrus hominis_ was spoken of up to the middle of the last\r\ncentury, no such species exists.\r\n\r\nBut in both hemispheres, in America much more often than in Europe,\r\nOestrid larvæ have been found in man. In Florida, Mexico, New Granada,\r\nArgentina, Brazil, Costa Rica and other districts, and especially where\r\nlarge herds of cattle are kept, myiasis oestrosa has been observed\r\nin shepherds, huntsmen and amongst the rural population. The larvæ\r\nof _Hypoderma bovis_, according to the observations of Goudot,[1182]\r\noccur as a parasite in man. Poilroux[1183] found larvæ of cavicolous\r\n_Oestridæ_ in the nose of a man, aged 55. Amongst the species of warble\r\nflies, whose larvæ are parasites in domestic animals and game in\r\nEurope, reliable observers have found larvæ of two kinds, _Hypoderma\r\nbovis_ and _Hypoderma diana_, also in man.[1184]\r\n\r\n[1182] Goudot, _Annal. d. Sci. nat._, 1845.\r\n\r\n[1183] Poilroux, _Journ de Méd., Chir._, etc., 1809.\r\n\r\n[1184] [_Hypoderma linearis_ is frequently confused with _H.\r\nbovis_.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\nThe larvæ of _H. bovis_ have very seldom been observed in the nose. The\r\ncase quoted by Kirschmann,[1185] which was that of a peasant woman,\r\naged 50, who was suffering from ozæna, and in which violent attacks of\r\nsneezing, epistaxis, pain in the forehead, and swelling of the face\r\nwere observed, is, according to Löw[1186] and Joseph,[1187] not an\r\nOestrid; Muscid larvæ were evidently the cause. By the injection of\r\ndiluted iron chloride solution seventy-nine larvæ were removed from the\r\nnose. In the case reported by Razoux[1188] the species of larva is not\r\ndefinitely known--at least, v. Frantzius[1189] did not consider them\r\nOestrid larvæ. Joseph does not definitely say that Oestrid larvæ were\r\nthe cause of a case which he quotes. He was sent a number of uninjured\r\nlarvæ of _Oestrus ovis_ ready to pupate, which were said to have been\r\nexpelled, during violent sneezing, from the nose of a peasant woman\r\nwho had suffered for six months from continuous frontal headache and\r\nchronic nasal catarrh.\r\n\r\n[1185] Kirschmann, _Wien. med. Wochenschr._, 1881.\r\n\r\n[1186] Löw, _Wien. med. Wochenschr._, 1882.\r\n\r\n[1187] Joseph, _Deutsch. med. Zeitg._, 1885.\r\n\r\n[1188] Razoux, _Journ. de Méd., Chir._, etc., 1758.\r\n\r\n[1189] v. Frantzius, _Virchow’s Archiv_, 1868, xliii.\r\n\r\nThe Oestrides prefer to use the surfaces of wounds on the skin of man\r\nto lay their eggs, which develop into larvæ; but they often use their\r\novipositors[1190] to make a fresh wound. In this case there arise in\r\nthe skin, and particularly in the subcutaneous connective tissue of\r\nthe neck, in the region of the shoulder, as well as in other parts of\r\nthe body painful, furuncle-like inflammations which are known under\r\nthe name of gad-fly boils. These boils may become the size of pigeons’\r\neggs; if several are together, they appear to form a connected tumour.\r\nEach tumour is elastic and somewhat movable, and has an orifice through\r\nwhich the larva breathes and discharges its excreta. At times these\r\nturn to festers and gangrenous disintegrations, which may even cause\r\nthe loss of a limb. Wilms[1191] had the opportunity a few years ago of\r\nobserving a case of myiasis dermatosa oestrosa in Leipzig. The fistula\r\nwhich led to the larva was slit open and the larva extracted. As a\r\nnotable characteristic of myiasis oestrosa Joseph states that the larvæ\r\ngrow very slowly. The flight time of the _Oestridæ_ is the hot summer\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n[1190] [The Oestrides appear to lay their ova on the hair of animals.\r\nThey do not puncture the skin.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n[1191] Wilms, _Deutsch. med. Wochenschr._, 1897.\r\n\r\nAdams[1192] observed on the Isthmus of Panama a number of cases of a\r\nskin disease which is caused by the larvæ of _Dermatobia noxialis_\r\n(_Gusano-peludo-Muche_). The larvæ penetrate not only the skin but also\r\nthe mucous membrane of the pharynx and larynx, and from there proceed\r\nthrough the tissue to the subcutaneous cellular tissue. The infection\r\nseems to result from bathing.\r\n\r\n[1192] Adams, _Journ. Amer. Med. Assoc._, 1904.\r\n\r\nThe study of “thimni,” a human myiasis caused by _Oestrus ovis_, by\r\nEd. and Et. Sergent,[1193] deals more with the zoology and with the\r\ngeographical distribution of this insect in North Africa than with the\r\nclinical appearances of myiasis. [This paper deals with matters of\r\ngreat interest, with important facts.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n[1193] Ed. and Et. Sergent, _Annal. de l’Inst. Pasteur_, 1907.\r\n\r\nThe treatment consists in the removal of the larvæ (from the nose); in\r\nBrazil it is the custom to drop tobacco juice into the boil in order to\r\nkill the larvæ (Strauch[1194]).\r\n\r\n[1194] Strauch, _Journ. of Cut. Dis._, 1906.\r\n\r\nOne is only justified in speaking of myiasis intestinalis when there\r\nis no doubt that living fly maggots or flies themselves can be proved\r\nto have been found in the fresh contents of the stomach or intestine\r\n(Schlesinger and Weichselbaum[1195]). In the discussion of myiasis\r\nintestinalis we give the evidence of Schlesinger and Weichselbaum, as\r\nwell as that of Wirsing,[1196] to which must be added a number of other\r\ninvestigations.\r\n\r\n[1195] Schlesinger and Weichselbaum, _Wien. klin. Wochenschr._, 1902, i.\r\n\r\n[1196] Wirsing, _Zeitschr. f. klin. Med._, 1906, lx.\r\n\r\nIn a great number of acute cases apparently only the stomach was\r\naffected, there being no signs in the intestine. In these cases sudden\r\nillness is noticed, colic, sometimes unbearable pains in the region\r\nof the stomach, pyrosis, vomiting or continuous intense inclination\r\nto vomit, occasionally even with the mixture of blood. Frequently a\r\ngeneral feeling of malaise, twinges of pain in the muscles, and attacks\r\nof giddiness were notified, very rarely fever. Generally all the\r\nsymptoms disappeared in a short time when the larvæ had been removed by\r\nan act of vomiting or by washing out the stomach.\r\n\r\nIt is well to note that in the history of many cases the pains\r\npreceding the expulsion of the larvæ are stated to be extremely violent.\r\n\r\nAcute myiasis of the intestinal canal frequently runs a course without\r\nspecial symptoms and is only an accidental condition; one has, however,\r\nin such cases to guard against errors. The fæces may be deposited in\r\nvessels or places where fly larvæ are in great numbers, or a subsequent\r\ninfection of the fæces with the eggs or larvæ of flies may have taken\r\nplace. Only when the inspection of the excrement immediately following\r\ndefæcation proves the presence of living larvæ, and when there were\r\ncertainly no fly larvæ in the vessel previously, can one speak of the\r\npassing of fly larvæ from the intestine. More frequent than the cases\r\nshowing no special symptoms are those with pronounced disturbances in\r\nthe intestinal passage, obstruction or diarrhœa (also constipation\r\nand diarrhœa alternately), violent and sometimes agonizing abdominal\r\npains (Pottiez[1197]), which preceded the evacuation of the larvæ and\r\nsubsided after their removal. General symptoms, like weakness, languor,\r\ntransitory vague pains, loss of appetite, sickness, rarely fever,\r\ngiddiness, attacks of faintness, epileptic attacks (Krause[1198])\r\nare observed. In a few cases blood and pus have been noticed in the\r\nevacuation of the bowels.\r\n\r\n[1197] Pottiez, _Bull. de l’Acad. royale de Méd. de Belgique_, xv.\r\n\r\n[1198] Krause, _Deutsch. med. Wochenschr._, 1886, xvii.\r\n\r\nIn the cases of chronic myiasis of the intestine the aspect of the\r\ndisease is dominated by the complex symptom of colitis mucosa.\r\n\r\nThe following features are noticeable, namely, the intermittent passing\r\nof blood, the influence over the expulsion of the larvæ of mechanical\r\nprocedure (massaging of the abdomen), the duration of the process for\r\nseveral years, the sometimes enormous number of insects contained in\r\nthe dejecta. Another clinically important factor is the passing of\r\nthe larvæ in batches. While for some time no larvæ may appear in the\r\nstools, they may suddenly be ejected in great numbers, either because\r\nthe conditions of feeding are not suitable, or because medicaments\r\nremove them from the intestine. The hæmorrhage is ascribed by\r\nSchlesinger and Weichselbaum directly to lesions of the mucous membrane\r\ncaused by the larvæ; in the case reported by these writers there were\r\nfound shreds of tissue as well as pus in the stool. The pains occurring\r\nspontaneously in the abdomen are at times influenced by position and\r\nattitude of the body, often they were more violent after rest and after\r\nevacuation of the bowels; often they were continuous, but in that case\r\nless intense; pressure on the abdomen is generally little felt. The\r\ncondition of the blood was in two cases (Pasquale[1199] and Schlesinger\r\nand Weichselbaum) a marked chlorotic one. The state of nutrition seems\r\nalmost always to suffer with prolongation of the disease, but in\r\nPeiper’s[1200] cases this was not so. The condition of the appetite\r\nwas in some instances good, in others very bad. A frequent symptom is\r\nheadache of a migraine-like character and neuralgic pains in different\r\nparts.\r\n\r\n[1199] Pasquale, _Centralbl. f. Bakt._, 1891.\r\n\r\n[1200] Peiper, “Fliegenlarv. als gelegentl. Parasiten d. Menschen,”\r\nBerlin, 1900.\r\n\r\nSchlesinger and Weichselbaum’s case shows that there are forms of\r\nmyiasis intestinalis which, after prolonged sickness, lead to death,\r\nand that in consequence of the formation of intestinal abscesses\r\nstricture of the intestine may arise from the subsequent formation of a\r\nscar.\r\n\r\nThe question of the mode of infection is interesting; in this mouth,\r\nnose and anus must be considered. The most frequent way is certainly\r\nby means of food on which flies have laid their eggs, or which is\r\npermeated with young maggots. This may be raw (especially grated)\r\nmeat, cheese, fruit, salad, milk, cabbage, cold farinaceous foods,\r\nraspberries. When the stomach is affected, when the gastric juice has\r\nlost acidity and power of digestion, the larvæ will be able to stay\r\nand develop more easily. According to Csokor,[1201] if the eggs get\r\ninto the gastro-intestinal canal of man with the food, the delicate\r\nstages of the young larvæ would certainly not survive the action of\r\nthe gastric juice. Salzmann[1202] assumed that the invasion occasionally\r\noccurred through the rectum, the larvæ creeping into the anus while\r\nthe person is asleep. Wirsing accepts this method of infection for two\r\nof his cases, where it was a question of the infection of an infant.\r\nSalzmann[1202] reports a case where the maggots of _Anthomyia_[1203]\r\n_scalaris_ were passed in great numbers from the urethra of an old\r\nman. The patient had been catheterized on account of urethral stricture\r\nand was probably infected with eggs or larvæ at the same time.\r\n\r\n[1201] Csokor, _Wien. klin. Wochenschr._, 1901, p. 129.\r\n\r\n[1202] Salzmann, _Württemberg. med. Korrespondenzbl._ 1883, liii.\r\n\r\n[1203] [This is presumably _Homalomyia_ (_Fannia_)\r\n_scalaris_.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis of the affection is easy and sure, if living larvæ\r\nare found in the contents of the stomach or in the stools, and if\r\ncontamination is out of the question.\r\n\r\nThe number of different species of flies whose larvæ are found in\r\nmyiasis intestinalis is considerable. The larvæ of species of Anthomyia\r\n(_A. canicularis_,[1204] _A. scalaris_, _etc._), of _Sarcophaga\r\ncarnaria_ and _S. magnifica_ and of _Musca vomitoria_[1205] are\r\nespecially observed.\r\n\r\n[1204] [This fly, common in houses, is known as _Homalomyia\r\ncanicularis_, and the next belongs to the same genus.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\n[1205] [This fly belongs to the genus _Calliphora_, not\r\n_Musca_.--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\nThe prognosis is certainly generally favourable, but must be made\r\nwith some reserve in chronic cases, in view of the observations of\r\nSchlesinger and Weichselbaum (intestinal stenosis).\r\n\r\nThe treatment must aim at removing the larvæ as soon as possible from\r\nthe digestive canal.\r\n\r\nIn cases of myiasis of the stomach, a thorough washing out of the\r\nstomach (Joseph,[1206] Staniek[1207]) is to be preferred to emetics\r\nused with success in individual instances; perhaps it would be\r\nadvisable to add menthol or thymol to the mixture.\r\n\r\n[1206] Joseph, _Deutsch. med. Zeitg._, 1885 and 1887.\r\n\r\n[1207] Staniek, _see_ Schlesinger and Weichselbaum, p. 47.\r\n\r\nIn myiasis of the intestine internal remedies and local treatment of\r\nthe intestine must be considered.\r\n\r\nSo far santonin seems to have proved to be the best remedy. In some\r\ncases extract. filicis maris, calomel, semina cucurbitæ, naphthalene\r\n0·1 to 0·5 (Peiper[1208]), infus. of Persian insect powder (5 in 200),\r\nmineral waters, Carlsbad water, seem to have had good results.\r\n\r\n[1208] Peiper, “Fliegenlarv. als gelegentl. Parasiten d. Menschen,”\r\nBerlin, 1900.\r\n\r\nFor irrigation of the rectum, weak solutions of argentum nitricum,\r\ntannin, thymol, gelatine, ol. ricini, naphthalene may be used. Wirsing\r\nadministered an aperient (Rurella compound liquorice powder) and a soap\r\nenema after the passing of the first larvæ.\r\n\r\nThe principal thing is the prophylaxis, which must include the careful\r\nprotection of articles of food, on which flies may lay their eggs\r\n(protection by glass dishes, tulle or fine wire nets). Fruit should not\r\nbe eaten before being washed or rubbed with a cloth.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Gastricolous Oestridæ* (Creeping Disease).\r\n\r\n  Syn.: _Creeping eruption_; _Larva migrans_; _Hautmaulwurf_;\r\n  _Dermatomyiasis linearis migrans oestrosa_; _Hyponomoderma_;\r\n  _Dermatitis linearis migrans_; _Linea migrans_; _Epidermiditis\r\n  linearis migrans Wolossatik_; _Kriechkrankheit_; _Hautkratzschorf_;\r\n  _Myiase hypodermique_.\r\n\r\nUnder the name “creeping disease,” R. J. Lee[1209] has recorded a\r\npeculiar affection of the skin in a three year old girl, which appeared\r\nfirst in the form of pale red, thread-like irregular protuberances,\r\nwhich seemed partly to become entwined on the right malleolus and had\r\nspread without causing special disturbances to the abdomen. Dickinson,\r\nFox and Duckworth[1210] reported, in connection with this, that they\r\nobserved a growth of this red line of about 1 in. per diem. Since then\r\na number of similar cases have been reported which, without doubt, were\r\ncases of larvæ creeping under the skin. Crocker[1211] saw such a case\r\nin a two year old girl, the progress of the red line varying in one\r\nnight between 4 and 7-1/2 in. In Europe the first case was observed in\r\nVienna, by v. Neumann and Rille,[1212] also in a two year old girl.\r\n\r\n[1209] R. J. Lee, _Journ. Clin. Soc.

Samson-Himmelstjerna,[1213] Sokoloff,[1214] Rawnitzky[1215] found\r\nlarvæ at the end of the tract, which had been recorded as larvæ of\r\nGastrophilus by Cholodowsky.[1216] According to Blanchard (_Arch. f.\r\nPar._, 1901) the larvæ were those of _Hypoderma bovis_.\r\n\r\n[1213] v.

Samson is of the opinion that they usually obtain\r\naccess to man as larvæ, Stelwagon[1217] believes that the infection\r\ngenerally occurs in a seaside watering place; a patient of\r\nEhrmann’s[1218] fell ill when he returned from the manœuvres, where he\r\nhad lain for some time on the ground. Here and there it is reported\r\nthat the eruption was preceded for a longer or shorter time by lesions\r\nof the skin (incised wounds, furuncles, slight excoriations, v.\r\nHarlingen[1219]).\r\n\r\n[1217] Stelwagon, _Journ.

Sci._, 1902.\r\n\r\nTwice it has been suggested that perhaps the parasites might come\r\nfrom vineyard snails (Crocker, Lenglet and Delaunay[1220]), and it\r\nis pointed out by v. Samson that in Russia the infection of peasants\r\nwho work in the fields was specially frequent. It is noticeable how\r\nfrequently the affection begins on uncovered parts of the body (face,\r\nhands, arms); but that fact, on the whole, is not in conflict with the\r\nstatement (Kengsep[1221]) that the disease makes its first appearance\r\nover the nates, because children often sit on the ground and play with\r\nthat part of their body uncovered. A case observed by us was that of an\r\nelderly lady who did not do this and was properly clothed, yet showed\r\nthe typical lines of creeping disease on the nates, and asserted again\r\nand again that she had the feeling as if a worm were creeping under her\r\nskin.\r\n\r\n[1220] Lenglet and Delaunay, _Annal. de Derm. et de Syph._, 1904.\r\n\r\n[1221] Kengsep, _Derm. Centralbl._, 1906, vii.\r\n\r\nThe disease occurs in children as well as adults, so that age, sex and\r\ncalling offer no determining point etiologically.\r\n\r\nThe clinical symptoms of the disease consist in the sudden appearance\r\nof itching and burning; if the cause is looked for one perceives a red\r\nline, raised but little above the surface of the skin, with irregular\r\ncurves, never branched, but often entwined, broadening more or less\r\nrapidly at one end (1 to 15 cm. in twenty-four hours). The larva can be\r\nseen sometimes with a lens under pressure of the skin as a dark spot;\r\nformations of pus, such as other larvæ produce, are not noticed; now\r\nand again there is a formation of little vesicles (Hamburger,[1222] v.\r\nHarlingen,[1223] Bruno,[1224] Ehrmann,[1225] Brodier and Fouquet,[1226]\r\nRawnitzky[1227]). It may happen that the parasite burrows through a\r\nsmall region of the skin with many close curves for some time; on the\r\nother hand, observations exist where it covered large tracts in a short\r\ntime. The itching and smarting cease in the place left by the larva,\r\nso that the patients even in the shortest tract can point out at which\r\nend the larva is, even if they have not watched the lengthening of the\r\ntract. Very rarely the larva invades the mucous membrane of the mouth,\r\nthe nose, and the conjunctiva, proceeding from thence to the external\r\ncutaneous area.\r\n\r\n[1222] Hamburger, _Journ. of Cut.

Harlingen), on the upper\r\nextremities (Samson, Meade and Freeman, Hutchins, Sokoloff, v.\r\nHarlingen, Brodier and Fouquet, Shelmire,[1230] Stelwagon), on the face\r\n(Sokoloff, Moorhead, Kumberg,[1231] Rawnitzky, Crocker, Boas[1232]),\r\non the neck (Sokoloff), and on the body (Ehrmann, Brodier and Fouquet,\r\nKaposi,[1233] Topsent[1234]).\r\n\r\n[1228] Morris, _Brit.

Wochenschr._, 1898.\r\n\r\n[1234] Topsent, _Arch. de Par._, 1901.\r\n\r\nThe duration of the affection varies very much; it varies between a few\r\nhours and some years[1235]; several times a spontaneous recovery has\r\nbeen reported.\r\n\r\n[1235] [This is extremely unlikely, as the bots of Hypoderma only live\r\nfor nine or ten months at the most!--F. V. T.]\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis of the disease is not at all difficult owing to its\r\npeculiar appearance.\r\n\r\nThe treatment can only consist in the removal or killing of the larvæ,\r\nsince one cannot rely on spontaneous recovery, even if it has occurred\r\nin some cases. If one should succeed in locating the larva as a black\r\nspot at the end of the tract, its removal by means of a needle is\r\nthe simplest method (Quortrup and Boas[1236]). In some instances a\r\ncure has been successfully accomplished by excision of the active\r\nend of the tract (v. Neumann and Rille, Schmid). In opposition to\r\nthis method, which not all patients will allow, the method practised\r\nby Arab women (Rille and Riecke[1237]) of killing the worm with red\r\nhot needles is quite rational. Shelmire[1238] used the electrolytic\r\nneedle for the destruction of the maggots, Stelwagon[1239] made use\r\nof cataphoresis, by means of which he applied a sublimate solution,\r\nafterwards cauterizing with a drop of nitric acid, as excision was\r\nrefused. Crocker[1240] and v. Harlingen[1241] injected small quantities\r\nof carbolic acid; Moorhead[1242] by a single freezing of the skin with\r\nethyl chloride, attained a definite cessation of the attack at the\r\nactive end. Hutchins[1243] in one case made use of hypodermic injection\r\nof a few drops of solution of cocaine and afterwards of 1 to 2 drops of\r\nchloroform; in a second case of repeated applications of tincture of\r\niodide, as Lenglet and Delaunay[1244] did. v. Harlingen[1245] allayed\r\nthe affection in his first case by rubbing in sapo viridis and tar,\r\nin Kensep’s[1246] case the cure seems to have been accomplished by an\r\nointment containing resorcin, in Meade and Freeman’s[1247] case by a 20\r\nper cent. ichthyol paste. In our case we made exclusive use of Lassar’s\r\npaste; within four weeks a cure resulted, probably spontaneously, since\r\none cannot ascribe any essential effect to this paste.\r\n\r\n[1236] Quortrup and Boas, _Hospitalstid._, 1907.\r\n\r\n[1237] Rille and Riecke, “Handb. d.

FANTHAM, M.A., D.Sc.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--NOTES ON RECENT RESEARCHES.\r\n\r\nSince the foregoing section on Protozoology was sent to press, certain\r\ninteresting observations and results have been published. Brief notes\r\non such, and some references thereto, are now added.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary, however, to remark that sometimes it is impossible\r\nto give a precise or rigid definition to a genus of Protozoa, owing\r\nto differences of opinion, to differences regarding nomenclature or\r\nto incompleteness of knowledge. Such a lack of definition, while\r\ninconvenient for the time being, is not unhopeful, as it directs\r\nattention to the necessity for further work, which is inevitable in\r\nsuch a relatively new and wide subject as protozoology. Thus, it may be\r\nnoted in illustration that Minchin, in 1912, in his text-book regarding\r\nthe genus _Entamœba_ writes: “The entozoic amœbæ are commonly placed\r\nin a distinct genus, _Entamœba_, distinguished from the free-living\r\nforms by little, however, except their habitat and the general (but not\r\ninvariable) absence of a contractile vacuole.”\r\n\r\n*Differences between Entamœba histolytica and E. coli.*--In\r\ncontinuation of the remarks on pp. 34 and 40, it may be added that\r\nLugol’s solution (iodine in aqueous potassium iodide solution) in fresh\r\nspecimens shows by brownish staining the presence of glycogen in the\r\nvacuoles of _Entamœba coli_. Such a reaction is rarely or never given\r\nby _E. histolytica_.\r\n\r\n*Phagedænic Amœbæ.*--Carini and others record cases in which the skin\r\naround an operation wound in connection with liver abscess became\r\ngangrenous. Amœbæ, possibly _Entamœba histolytica_, were found therein\r\nand may have been responsible for the gangreno-phagedænic action.\r\n\r\n*Endamœba gingivalis* (_see_ pp. 43, 44).--Smith and Barrett,[1248]\r\nafter analysing the early literature, state (June, 1915) that\r\n_Endamœba gingivalis_, Gros, 1849, is the correct name for the\r\nfollowing organisms: _E. buccalis_, Prowazek, 1904 (see p. 43); _Amœba\r\ngingivalis_, Gros, 1849; _Amœba buccalis_, Steinberg, 1862, and _Amœba\r\ndentalis_, Grassi, 1879. They conclude that _E. gingivalis_ is the\r\ncausal agent of pyorrhœa alveolaris, and that this disease responds to\r\ntreatment with emetine.\r\n\r\n[1248] _Journ. of Parasitol._, i, p. 159.\r\n\r\n*Entamœba kartulisi* (see p. 44), synonym _E. maxillaris_, Kartulis, is\r\nconsidered to be _E. gingivalis_.\r\n\r\nSmith and Barrett adopt the generic name _Endamœba_, Leidy, 1879 (_see_\r\nfootnote on p. 31, also p. 34). Leidy worked on _Endamœba blattæ_.\r\n\r\n*Craigia and Craigiasis* (_see_ p. 45).--Barlow[1249] (May, 1915) found\r\n_Craigia_ (_Paramœba_) _hominis_ in cases of chronic diarrhœa and mild\r\ndysentery in Honduras. He also described a new species of _Craigia_\r\nunder the name of _C. migrans_. Fifty-six cases were studied, five of\r\nwhich were due to _Craigia hominis_, the remainder to _C. migrans_. In\r\n_C. migrans_, each flagellate, on attaining full development, becomes\r\nan amœba without dividing. Each amœba encysts and produces a number of\r\nflagellates which are somewhat like cercomonads. On the other hand, in\r\n_C. hominis_ the flagellate form produces, by longitudinal fission,\r\nseveral generations of flagellates before entering upon the amœbic\r\nstage. The cysts of _C. migrans_ contain fewer “swarmers” (flagellulæ)\r\nthan those of _C. hominis_, but the “swarmers” are somewhat larger,\r\nnamely, 5 µ instead of 3 µ in diameter. Further, there is no accessory\r\nnuclear body in _C. migrans_, but its flagellum stains more deeply than\r\nthat of _C. hominis_ and has a peculiar banded appearance.\r\n\r\n[1249] _Amer. Journ. Trop. Dis. and Prevent. Med._, ii, p. 680.\r\n\r\n*Human Trichomoniasis* (_see_ pp. 52–56).--Lynch[1250] (April and\r\nMay, 1915), working in Charleston, seems to favour the view that the\r\ntrichomonads found in the vagina, urethra, mouth, lungs and alimentary\r\ntract are one and the same organism, and that these flagellates may\r\nfurther excite already existing inflammatory conditions. He gives\r\ndetailed histories of cases of (_a_) infection of the vagina and gums,\r\nand (_b_) intestinal infection manifested as intermittent attacks of\r\ndiarrhœa. The flagellates were found in catarrhal vaginal discharge,\r\nin blood-stained scrapings from the gums (together with _Endamœba\r\nbuccalis_), and in stools after a purge of magnesium sulphate. The\r\nparasites were tetratrichomonads (_see_ footnote, p. 53), that is, each\r\npossessed four flagella anteriorly as well as an undulating membrane.\r\nLynch successfully infected rabbits from the cases and from cultures of\r\nthe parasite. Encysted trichomonads were seen in a patient’s stools,\r\nin rabbits infected therefrom and in cultures. The culture medium used\r\nwas bouillon acidified with about 0·05 per cent. acetic acid and the\r\ncultures were maintained at 30° C.\r\n\r\n[1250] _Ibid._, p. 627; _New York Med. Journ._, May 1, 1915, ci, p. 886.\r\n\r\nTrichomonads occur in the digestive tracts, for example, the cæca\r\nof rats and mice (fig. 422). In man allied flagellates can occur in\r\nsimilar situations, as well as in other parts of the intestine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 422.--_Trichomonas_ from cæcum and gut of rat: _n_,\r\nnucleus; _bl_, blepharoplast; _fl_, flagella; _ax_, axostyle; _m_,\r\nundulating membrane; _b_, line of attachment of undulating membrane to\r\nthe body. × 2,000 approx. (Original.)]\r\n\r\nOther trichomonad-like organisms have been recently described from\r\nthe fæces of man, more particularly from cases of chronic dysentery\r\nin the tropics. Derrieu and Raynaud[1251] (July, 1914), working in\r\nAlgeria, found a flagellate possessing five free flagella anteriorly\r\nand an undulating membrane apparently lateral. They named the parasite\r\n_Hexamastix ardin-delteili_, but the generic name _Hexamastix_ is\r\npre-occupied. Chatterjee[1252] (January, 1915), working in India,\r\nfound probably the same flagellate and called it _Pentatrichomonas\r\nbengalensis_.\r\n\r\n[1251] _Bull. Soc. Path. Exot._, vii, p. 571.\r\n\r\n[1252] _Ind. Med. Gaz._, l, p. 5.\r\n\r\n*Chilomastix* (*Tetramitus*) *mesnili* (_see_ p. 57).--Alexeieff[1253]\r\n(1914) now places the parasite originally called _Macrostoma mesnili_,\r\nby Wenyon (1910), in the genus _Chilomastix_, Alexeieff. The\r\ndifferential characters of the genera _Tetramitus_ and _Chilomastix_\r\nare not especially well marked. According to Alexeieff, _Tetramitus_ is\r\ncharacterized by four unequal flagella (which he figures anteriorly), a\r\nventral cytostome in the form of a linear cleft and a pulsatile vacuole\r\nin front of the anterior nucleus. _Chilomastix_, according to the same\r\nauthor, has three forwardly directed flagella and a fourth backwardly\r\ndirected one in the cytostome, which is well developed (fig. 423).\r\nSome authors consider that the fourth flagellum forms the edge of an\r\nundulating membrane in the cytostome.\r\n\r\n[1253] _Zool. Anzeiger_, xliv, pp. 203, 206; and _ibid._, xxxix, p. 678.\r\n\r\nDiagrams of _Chilomastix mesnili_ are given in fig. 423.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 423.--_Chilomastix_ (_Tetramitus_) _mesnili_. _a_,\r\n_b_, _c_, flagellate forms; _d_, rounded or encysted form. × 2,500.\r\n(Original.)]\r\n\r\n*Giardia* (*Lamblia*) *intestinalis* (_see_ p. 57).--Alexeieff[1254]\r\n(1914) considers that _Lamblia intestinalis_, Lambl, should be placed\r\nin the genus _Giardia_, Kunstler, 1882. Bipartition occurs in the\r\nencysted state. The axostyles persist in the quadrinucleate cyst.\r\n\r\n[1254] _Zool. Anzeiger_, xliv, p. 210.\r\n\r\n*Cercomonas hominis* (_see_ p. 61).--This parasite is considered by\r\nsome authors to be of a doubtful nature, as it is thought to have\r\nbeen mistaken for deformed or incompletely observed _Trichomonas_ or\r\n_Chilomastix_ or even _Lamblia_.\r\n\r\nWenyon[1255] (1910) described _Cercomonas longicauda_ from cultures\r\nof human fæces. It is considered that the genus is very confused, and\r\nthe author points out that the tail flagellum has been overlooked. He\r\nconsiders that the genus _Cercomonas_ should include flagellates with\r\nan anterior blunt end from which arises a single long flagellum, and a\r\nposterior tapering end also with a flagellum, which can be traced over\r\nthe surface of the body towards the insertion of the anterior flagellum.\r\n\r\n[1255] _Quart. Journ. Micros. Sci._, lv, p. 241.\r\n\r\nAnother species, _Cercomonas parva_, has been found in cultures of\r\nhuman fæces by Hartmann and Chagas[1256] (1910). It has a somewhat\r\ndifferent structure.\r\n\r\n[1256] _Mem. Inst. Oswaldo Cruz_, ii, p. 67.\r\n\r\nFurther researches are necessary on the organisms variously referred to\r\nthe genus _Cercomonas_.\r\n\r\n*Transmissive Phase of Trypanosomes in Vertebrates.*--In addition to\r\nthe general remarks on the morphology of trypanosomes set forth on\r\npp. 70 to 72, it may be noted that Woodcock[1257] (November, 1914)\r\nstates that, in certain cases, there is a definite transmissive phase\r\nof a trypanosome in its vertebrate host. He quotes the work of Minchin\r\nand himself on _T. noctuæ_ of the little owl, in which the transmissive\r\nform is spindle-shaped and occurs in the bird’s peripheral blood during\r\nthe early summer months (_see_ p. 69). A similar phase occurs in _T.\r\nfringillarum_, and Robertson[1258] has found that the short, stumpy\r\nform of _T. gambiense_ is its transmissive phase in vertebrates.\r\n\r\n[1257] _Arch. f. Protistenk._, xxxv, p. 197.\r\n\r\n[1258] _Proc. Roy. Soc._, B, lxxxv, p. 527.\r\n\r\n*Trypanosoma lewisi* (_see_ p. 88).--Brown (1914–15) has published some\r\ninteresting results on the potential pathogenicity of _T. lewisi._\r\n\r\n*Blepharoplastless Trypanosomes* (_see_ p. 101).--Laveran[1259] (April,\r\n1915) suggested a practical use of strains of blepharoplastless\r\ntrypanosomes produced by the action of drugs. He finds that tryposafrol\r\nwill also produce such strains, and remarks on blepharoplastless\r\nstrains of _T. evansi_ and _T. brucei_, which in the former case can\r\nundergo 450 passages without reversion, and in the latter 273 passages.\r\nHe states that if it is desired to inoculate surra or nagana to Capridæ\r\nor Bovidæ in order to produce immunity, use should be made of the\r\nblepharoplastless races of the respective trypanosomes, which races\r\nare a little less virulent than the corresponding normal ones. Also,\r\nthe immunity which follows from an infection due to blepharoplastless\r\n_T. evansi_ or _T. brucei_ is only a little less complete than that\r\nfollowing infections from either of the respective normal strains.\r\n\r\n[1259] _C. R. Acad. Sci._, clx, p. 543.\r\n\r\n*The Experimental Introduction of certain Insect Flagellates\r\ninto various Vertebrates, and its bearing on the Evolution of\r\nLeishmaniasis.*--In continuation of the remarks on pp. 103, 104,\r\nand 112, further researches have been conducted on the introduction\r\ninto vertebrates of flagellates normally parasitic in insects. The\r\nvertebrates became infected by inoculation with the flagellates or by\r\nbeing fed on insects containing the protozoa. Fantham and Porter[1260]\r\n(June, 1915) published the following results. Flagellates from\r\nsanguivorous and non-sanguivorous insects were used, and cold-blooded\r\nas well as warm-blooded vertebrates as hosts. The introduced protozoa\r\nwere pathogenic to the mammals, but not markedly so to the cold-blooded\r\nvertebrates. _Herpetomonas jaculum_, _H. stratiomyiæ_, _H. pediculi_,\r\nand _Crithidia gerridis_ (parasitic in certain waterbugs) proved\r\npathogenic to mice. A puppy was infected by way of the digestive tract\r\nwith _H. ctenocephali_. Frogs became infected with _H. jaculum_ and\r\nwith _C. gerridis_, toads and grass snakes with _H. jaculum_, lizards\r\nwith _C. gerridis_, and sticklebacks with _H. jaculum_. Second and\r\nthird passages of some of the parasites were obtained. The protozoa,\r\nwhether _Herpetomonas_ or _Crithidia_, were present in the vertebrate\r\nhosts in either the non-flagellate or the flagellate form, or usually\r\nboth. They were more abundant in the internal organs of the hosts,\r\nmore particularly in the liver, spleen and bone-marrow. In all\r\nexperiments in which _C. gerridis_ was used the parasite invariably\r\nretained the crithidial facies in the vertebrate host. No transition\r\nto a trypanosome was ever seen. Infections in adult animals were not\r\nso heavy as in the young ones, and the parasites were more virulent in\r\nyoung hosts, as is the case with Mediterranean kala-azar in children.\r\n\r\n[1260] _Proc. Camb. Philosoph. Soc._, xviii, p. 137; and _Annals Trop.\r\nMed. and Parasitol._, ix, p. 335.\r\n\r\nThe mode of infection of the vertebrate in Nature seems to be\r\ncontaminative, either by its food or through an already existing\r\nabrasion or puncture on the surface of its body. Cases in which the\r\nflagellate-infected insects have been allowed to suck the blood of\r\nvertebrates have proved negative up to the present. In areas where\r\nleishmaniases are endemic, an examination should be made of all\r\ninsects and other invertebrates likely to come into contact with\r\nmen or dogs, or rats and mice (see below), in order to ascertain\r\nif these invertebrates harbour herpetomonads. Preventive measures\r\nshould be directed against such invertebrates, especially arthropods.\r\nFurther, it is likely that certain vertebrates, such as reptiles and\r\namphibia (especially those that are insectivorous), may serve as\r\nreservoirs of leishmaniases, or, as they should preferably be termed,\r\nherpetomoniases. From such reservoirs the herpetomonads may reach\r\nman by the agency of ectoparasites or flies, especially such as are\r\nsanguivorous.\r\n\r\nThat vertebrates in Nature can harbour herpetomonads in their blood has\r\nbeen shown by the work of Dutton and Todd (1903) on the herpetomonads\r\nof Gambian mice, while the recently published investigations of\r\nFantham and Porter[1261] (June, 1915) on natural herpetomonads in\r\nthe blood of mice in England have shown that these rodents may be a\r\nnatural reservoir of herpetomoniasis. The origin of the infection of\r\nmice is to be sought in a flagellate of an ectoparasite of the mouse,\r\nvery probably _Herpetomonas pattoni_ parasitic in various fleas, which\r\nprotozoön can adapt itself to life in the blood of mice. Herpetomonads\r\nwere also found naturally in the blood of birds by Sergent (1907).\r\nRecently, Fantham and Porter have successfully infected birds with\r\nherpetomonads experimentally.\r\n\r\n[1261] _Parasitology_, viii, p. 128.\r\n\r\nThe significance of insect flagellates in relation to the evolution\r\nof disease has recently been set forth by Fantham[1262] (June, 1915).\r\nThe deductions to be made from the occurrence of a herpetomonad stage\r\nin _Leishmania_, especially in _L. tropica_, in man himself, and of\r\nflagellate stages of the so-called _Histoplasma capsulatum_ in man are\r\nfully discussed and correlated. It is pointed out that flagellosis of\r\nplants (see p. 104) may possibly be connected with leishmaniasis. The\r\nevolution of _Leishmania_ from flagellates of invertebrates is thus\r\ntraced and the way again indicated for preventive measures against\r\nleishmaniasis, as first set forth by Dodds Price and Rogers.\r\n\r\n[1262] _Annals Trop. Med. and Parasitol._, ix, p. 335.\r\n\r\nFranchini and Mantovani (March, 1915) have successfully infected\r\nrats and mice by inoculation or by feeding with _Herpetomonas muscæ\r\ndomesticæ_ obtained from flies and from cultures.\r\n\r\nIt is of great interest to note that the recent observations of Ed.\r\nand Et. Sergent, Lemaire and Senevet[1263] (1914) have demonstrated\r\nthe presence of a herpetomonad flagellate in cultures of the blood\r\nand organs of geckos obtained from areas in Algeria in which Oriental\r\nsore, due to _L. tropica_, is prevalent. _Phlebotomus_ flies, which may\r\nharbour a natural herpetomonad, feed on the geckos and on men. Hence\r\nanimals like geckos may possibly act as reservoirs of leishmaniasis.\r\nLindsay[1264] (1914) writes that the parasite of dermo-mucosal\r\nleishmaniasis in Paraguay is believed by native sufferers to be\r\nconserved in rattlesnakes, and spread by ticks or flies (_Simulium_)\r\nfeeding on the reptiles and transferring the parasite to man.\r\n\r\n[1263] _Bull. Soc. Path. Exot._, vii, p. 577.\r\n\r\n[1264] _Trans. Soc. Trop. Med. and Hyg._, vii, p. 259.\r\n\r\n*The Transmission of Spirochæta duttoni* (_see_ p. 116).--It is\r\nprobable that _Ornithodorus savignyi_ acts as the transmitting agent of\r\n_S. duttoni_ in places like Somaliland (Drake-Brockman, 1915).[1265]\r\n\r\n[1265] _Ibid._, viii, p. 201.\r\n\r\n*Spirochæta bronchialis* (_see_ p. 122).--The morphology and\r\nlife-history of _S. bronchialis_ have been investigated by\r\nFantham[1266] (July, 1915). From researches conducted in the\r\nAnglo-Egyptian Sudan, he found that _S. bronchialis_ is an organism\r\npresenting marked polymorphism, a feature that has only been determined\r\nby the examination of numerous preparations from the deeper bronchial\r\nregions of various patients.\r\n\r\n[1266] _Annals Trop. Med. and Parasitol._, ix, p. 391.\r\n\r\n_S. bronchialis_ varies in length from 5 µ to 27 µ, and its breadth\r\nis about 0·2 µ to 0·6 µ. These variations are due to the processes of\r\ngrowth and division. Many of the parasites measure either 14 µ to 16 µ\r\nlong, or 7 µ, to 9 µ, the latter resulting from transverse division\r\nof the former. The ends show much variation in form, but approach the\r\nacuminate type on the whole. The discrepancies in dimensions given by\r\nthe very few previous workers on the subject are probably the result of\r\nthe measurement of a limited number of parasites. All such sizes can\r\nbe found on some occasion during the progress of the disease, when a\r\nlarger number of spirochætes is examined.\r\n\r\nThe movements of _S. bronchialis_ are active, but of relatively short\r\nduration, when it is removed from the body. The number of coils of the\r\nspirochæte is rather an index of its rapidity of motion than a fixed\r\ncharacteristic of the species.\r\n\r\nThe motile phase of _S. bronchialis_ is succeeded by one of granule\r\nformation, the granules or coccoid bodies serving as a resting stage\r\nfrom which new spirochætes are produced. The formation of coccoid\r\nbodies and reproduction of spirochætes from them can be observed in\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n_S. bronchialis_ is a species distinct from the spirochætes occurring\r\nin the mouth. It differs from them in morphology, pathogenicity and in\r\nstaining reactions. It is not a developmental form of any bacterium,\r\nand is an entity in itself.\r\n\r\nThe passage from man to man is effected most probably by means of\r\nspirochætes, and especially coccoid bodies, that leave the body in\r\nthe spray with expired air and by way of the nasal secretions. Owing\r\nto the fragility and short life of _S. bronchialis_ extracorporeally,\r\nthe resistant coccoid bodies in air, in dried sputum and dust, and\r\npossibly also on the bodies of flies and other insects, are probably\r\ninstrumental in inducing attacks of bronchial spirochætosis in human\r\nbeings, especially those having a lowered bodily resistance, such as\r\noccurs after a chill. Lurie (December, 1915), has described a case from\r\nSerbia.\r\n\r\n*The Spirochætes of the Human Mouth* (_see_ p. 122).--Two species of\r\nspirochætes were recorded as occurring in the human mouth about forty\r\nor fifty years ago. These are _Spirochæta buccalis_, Steinberg (often\r\nascribed to Cohn, 1875), and _S. dentium_, Miller (often attributed to\r\nKoch, 1877).\r\n\r\nThe most recent work on _S. dentium_ and _S. buccalis_ is that of\r\nFantham[1267] (July, 1915), who observed the parasites ascribed to\r\nCohn and to Koch, these being the two common spirochætes seen in the\r\nmouths of natives of the Sudan and of Europeans in England, as well as\r\nthe forms described and cultivated by recent investigators. Some of the\r\nmouth spirochætes are not very active, but there is marked corkscrew\r\nand boring movement, and they are flexible. Tangles or tomenta of these\r\nmouth spirochætes are common. Internal structure is seen with some\r\ndifficulty, but in some specimens it can be determined, and chromatin\r\ngranules are then seen. Mühlens (1907) figured stained specimens of _S.\r\nbuccalis_ and _S. dentium_, in which chromatin-coloured granules were\r\ndistributed along the bodies of the organisms.\r\n\r\n[1267] _Annals Trop. Med. and Parasitol._, ix, p. 402.\r\n\r\n_S. dentium_ has tapering ends, and varies in length from 4 µ to 10 µ.\r\n_S. dentium_ is rather like _Treponema pallidum_, and has been placed\r\nby some workers--for example, Dobell--in the genus _Treponema_. It\r\nhas already been mentioned, on p. 128, that Noguchi cultivated three\r\nspecies of _Treponema_ from the human mouth--namely, _T. macrodentium_,\r\n_T. microdentium_, and _T. mucosum_, but they cannot be easily\r\ndistinguished morphologically, and so may appear to be biological\r\nvarieties of _S. dentium_.\r\n\r\n_S. buccalis_ has somewhat rounded or bluntly acuminate ends and varies\r\nin length from 9 µ to 22 µ. A slight membrane or crest may sometimes be\r\nobserved. _S. buccalis_ was found to be the predominant spirochæte in\r\nthe mouths of eight natives examined by Fantham in the Anglo-Egyptian\r\nSudan.\r\n\r\n_S. buccalis_ and _S. dentium_ take up stains well and with\r\nrelative ease. Intracellular stages of the parasites are uncommon.\r\nMultiplication by binary fission has also been observed. Coccoid bodies\r\nor granule stages of the mouth spirochætes are formed, but appear to be\r\nrelatively few in number.\r\n\r\nJ. G. and D. Thomson[1268] (1914) have written an interesting paper\r\non various spirochætes occurring in the alimentary tract of man and\r\nof some of the lower animals. They have also given a useful list of\r\nreferences, and the work of some of the earlier authors is discussed in\r\nthe paper.\r\n\r\n[1268] _Proc. Roy. Soc. Med._, vii, pt. 1, p. 47.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the general morphology of spirochætes, it may be noted\r\nthat the so-called axial fibre of Zuelzer is acknowledged to be\r\nhomologous with the membrane or crista of molluscan spirochætes.\r\n\r\n*Coccidia in Cattle.*--Regarding the remarks on coccidiosis or “red\r\ndysentery” in cattle on p. 147, it may be added that Schultz[1269]\r\n(July, 1915) has found the malady among cattle in the Philippine\r\nIslands. He states that some irregular or atypical cases of apparent\r\nrinderpest are really due to coccidia. As has been pointed out by\r\nMontgomery, rinderpest can be transmitted by blood inoculation,\r\nwhile coccidiosis cannot be so transmitted, but may be diagnosed by\r\nthe microscope. These differences should be remembered as the two\r\ndiseases are often found to be associated and are difficult to separate\r\nclinically. Coccidia have also been found in Australian cattle.\r\n\r\n[1269] _Journ. Infect. Dis._, xvii, p. 95.\r\n\r\n*The Hæmosporidia.*--It is likely that this order (_see_ p. 151) may be\r\nsoon abolished. Mesnil[1270] (April, 1915) considers that the grouping\r\nof the three families, Plasmodiidæ (or Hæmamœbidæ), Hæmogregarinidæ\r\nand Piroplasmidæ in the order Hæmosporidia is no longer possible,\r\nbecause of the coccidian nature of the Hæmogregarines (_see_ p. 154).\r\nThe Coccidia are divisible into the Adeleidea and the Eimeridea\r\n(_see_ p. 141). The Hæmogregarinidæ are allied to the former, and the\r\nPlasmodiidæ to the latter. The Piroplasmidæ, until more is known of\r\ntheir life-cycle in the invertebrate host, cannot be more definitely\r\nplaced.\r\n\r\n[1270] _Bull. Soc. Path. Exot._, viii, p. 241.\r\n\r\n*The Leucocytozoa of Birds.*--Regarding the statement, on p. 153,\r\nthat Laveran and França consider that avian leucocytozoa may inhabit\r\nred blood cells, it may be added that França[1271] (April, 1915)\r\nremarks that the action of the parasites on the red cells is very\r\nrapid and very intense. The host cells become so altered that it is\r\ndifficult to recognize their true nature. He used very young birds in\r\nhis researches. Two shapes of host cell are considered, namely, those\r\nwith fusiform prolongations, and those which are rounded and without\r\nsuch prolongations (_see_ p. 153). The movements and form of the\r\nLeucocytozoa determine the shape of the host cell, as was pointed out\r\nby Fantham[1272] in 1910.\r\n\r\n[1271] _Ibid._, p. 229.\r\n\r\n[1272] _Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond._, 1910, p. 694.\r\n\r\nSchizogony of these parasites has been seen by França (1915) and by\r\nColes (1914), in addition to Fantham (1910), and to Moldovan (1913),\r\nmentioned on p. 153. Schizogony may also take place in the lungs of\r\nthe host. The genus _Leucocytozoön_, established by Ziemann in 1898,\r\nbelongs to the family Hæmamœbidæ.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--FORMULÆ OF SOME CULTURE MEDIA.\r\n\r\n(1) *Culture Media for growing Amœbæ.*--There has been much discussion\r\nas to whether the true parasitic _Entamœbæ_ or _Endamœbæ_ can be\r\ngrown on culture media (_see_ p. 42). Undoubtedly certain free-living\r\namœbæ can be so grown, and it is considered that some of the earlier\r\nresearches on the so-called artificial growth of the dysenteric amœbæ\r\nwere really due to contaminations with free-living forms. The following\r\nmedia are worthy of note:--\r\n\r\nMusgrave and Clegg in 1904 devised a culture medium for amœbæ. The\r\norganisms grown by them were probably not dysenteric amœbæ, as was\r\nthought, but free-living forms. Phillips[1273] (1915) gives a slightly\r\nmodified formula of Musgrave and Clegg’s medium, thus:--\r\n\r\n  Agar-agar                         2·5   grm.\r\n  Sodium chloride                   0·05   \"\r\n  Liebig’s beef extract             0·05   \"\r\n  Normal sodium hydroxide           2·0   c.c.\r\n  Distilled water                 100·0    \"\r\n\r\n[1273] “Amœbiasis and the Dysenteries,” p. 8.\r\n\r\nWithout clarifying, sterilize at 7 kilograms pressure per square\r\ncentimetre for about three-quarters of an hour. It should be neutral to\r\nphenolphthalein.\r\n\r\nAnna W. Williams[1274] (1911) described a medium consisting of fresh\r\ntissue spread on agar plates for the culture of amœbæ. There are\r\nthree stages in the procedure: (1) obtaining living amœbæ free from\r\nother living organisms; (2) obtaining sterile tissue; and (3) making\r\nsuccessive transplants of amœbæ and tissue, and showing that every\r\ntransplant is free from other living organisms. Each step requires\r\nmany controls. The essentials of the method may now be given. Remove\r\naseptically and rapidly the tissue required, such as brain, liver,\r\nkidney, or spleen, from a freshly killed animal (guinea-pig, rabbit, or\r\ndog). Put each tissue on a separate agar plate. Cut the selected tissue\r\ninto tiny pieces, and spread them over freshly made agar plates. Place\r\nthese plates in a thermostat at 36° C. for twenty-four hours to insure\r\nsterility. Add the broken up tissue to the amœbæ, free from bacteria,\r\nand maintain the cultures in thermostats, some at 36° C., and some\r\nat 20° C. to 24° C. Emulsions of liver and brain in sterile neutral\r\nglycerine may also be used. The freshly removed tissue serves as food\r\nfor the amœbæ.\r\n\r\n[1274] _Journ. Med. Research_, xxv, p. 263; and _Proc. Soc. Exper.\r\nBiol. and Med._, viii, p. 56.\r\n\r\nThe cultural amœbæ mentioned on p. 42 were grown on such media or\r\nmodifications thereof. One modified medium actually used was brain\r\ntissue, to which blood was added from day to day, and an easily\r\nassimilable bacterium (one of the influenza group of bacilli) was\r\npresent, which did not overgrow the medium at a temperature of 38° C.\r\nDifferent conditions of food and of temperature produced morphological\r\nvariations in the cultural amœbæ.\r\n\r\nCouret and J. Walker[1275] (1913) state that they have cultivated five\r\nvarieties of intestinal amœbæ, the associated bacteria having been\r\npreviously separated. They used a medium consisting of agar to which\r\nsterile autolysed tissue had been added. The sterile tissue, such as\r\nbrain or liver, was kept in a sterile thermostat at a temperature of\r\n40° C. for ten to twenty days. The surface of the agar should be broken\r\nup before use, and the medium must not be too acid (not over 1·5 per\r\ncent.). They consider that autolysed tissue is necessary for the growth\r\nof Entamœbæ, and that naturally associated bacteria aid growth by\r\nautolysing the tissues.\r\n\r\n[1275] _Journ. Exper. Med._, xviii, p. 252.\r\n\r\n(2) *Culture Media for the growth of Protozoa parasitic in the\r\nBlood.*--MacNeal and Novy,[1276] in 1903, used a mixture of blood and\r\nagar for the cultivation of trypanosomes such as _T. lewisi_ and _T.\r\nbrucei_. They employed varying proportions of the blood and agar, a\r\nmedium consisting of two parts of defibrinated rabbit’s blood mixed\r\nwith one part of agar being useful. The trypanosomes grew in the\r\nwater of condensation. Some of the authors’ earlier formulæ contained\r\ndifferent proportions of blood and agar with a little peptone, while\r\none of these media contained meat extract, agar, peptone, salt and\r\nsodium carbonate. The temperature, like the proportion of blood and\r\nagar, varied with the trypanosome investigated, but the optimum was\r\n25° C.\r\n\r\n[1276] _See Sleeping Sickness Bulletin_ (1909), i, No. 8, p. 287.\r\n\r\nMathis[1277] (1906) somewhat simplified the technique of Novy and\r\nMacNeal. He collected the blood of a suitable animal, such as\r\nrabbit, cow or dog, strict asepsis not being essential. The blood\r\nwas defibrinated in the ordinary way. One part of blood was added\r\nto two parts of agar at 50° C. The mixture was sterilized several\r\ntimes by heating to 75° C. or 100 ° C. Slopes were made and the water\r\nof condensation was inoculated with a little blood containing the\r\ntrypanosomes. Blood may be obtained from a superficial vein or from the\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n[1277] _C. R. Soc. Biol._, lxi, p. 550.\r\n\r\n_Novy-MacNeal-Nicolle or N. N. N. Medium._--In 1908 C. Nicolle[1278]\r\nbrought forward a modification of the Novy-MacNeal (N.N.) medium. The\r\nformula is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Agar                             14 grm.\r\n  Sea salt                          6  \"\r\n  Water                           900  \"\r\n\r\n[1278] _C. R. Acad. Sci._, cxlvi, p. 842.\r\n\r\nApparently pure sodium chloride can be substituted equally well for sea\r\nsalt. The mixture is placed in tubes and sterilized in an autoclave.\r\nTo each tube one-third of its volume of rabbit blood, taken by aseptic\r\npuncture of the heart, is added. The salt agar is kept liquid at 45° C.\r\nto 50° C. and the blood is added to the mixture. The culture medium\r\nso prepared is maintained for five days at 37° C., and then for a few\r\ndays at room temperature. This medium was devised for the cultivation\r\nof _Leishmania_ (_see_ p. 106), but trypanosomes may also be grown\r\nthereon. Subsequently, Nicolle recommended the use of citrated rat’s\r\nblood heated to 45° C. for half an hour, instead of defibrinated\r\nrabbit’s blood. On such a medium, J. G. Thomson and Sinton[1279] (1912)\r\nsucceeded in growing _Trypanosoma gambiense_ and _T. rhodesiense_\r\n(_see_ pp. 76, 83).\r\n\r\n[1279] _Annals Trop. Med. and Parasitol._, vi, p. 331.\r\n\r\nNoguchi’s media for the cultivation of Spirochætes and Treponemata are\r\ndescribed on pp. 123, 125. Hata’s modification is discussed on p. 126.\r\n\r\nBass’s glucose-blood medium for the cultivation of malarial parasites\r\nis described on pp. 170–172. It has also been used successfully for the\r\ncultivation of _Piroplasma_ or _Babesia_ (_see_ p. 172).\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--BRIEF NOTES ON GENERAL PROTOZOOLOGICAL TECHNIQUE.\r\n\r\nThe object of this book is to give accounts of the structure and\r\nlife-histories of the numerous parasitic organisms that affect man\r\nmore particularly. It is, therefore, inappropriate to devote much\r\nspace to a consideration of technique, regarding which many volumes\r\nhave already been written. Methods of procedure are largely matters of\r\nopinion, and the technique that gives brilliant results when used by\r\none investigator may be a complete failure in the hands of another. In\r\nthe present appendix, brief notes regarding certain relatively simple\r\nmethods only can be given, because the number of fixatives in use is\r\nvery great; there are also large numbers of stains as well as many\r\nmodifications of them, while the methods of applying both fixatives\r\nand stains are, perhaps, still more numerous. There are so many, in\r\nfact, that confusion frequently arises from the multiplicity of choice\r\npresented to the worker. Those desiring more information on the subject\r\nof technique are advised to consult the treatises of Bolles Lee[1280]\r\nand of Langeron.[1281]\r\n\r\n[1280] “The Microtomist’s Vade Mecum” (7th edition, 1913). London: J.\r\nand A. Churchill.\r\n\r\n[1281] “Précis de Microscopie” (1913). Paris: Masson et Cie.\r\n\r\n\r\nFresh Material.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Simple Examination._\r\n\r\n_Fluid Substances, such as Blood and Sputum._--A small quantity of\r\nthe substance to be examined is taken on a sterile platinum loop and\r\ntransferred to a perfectly clean glass slide. A clean cover-slip\r\nis gently lowered on to the drop, air bubbles being avoided. The\r\npreparation is luted with vaseline or paraffin and examined first with\r\na low power and then with a high power objective. The light is cut down\r\nby partly closing the diaphragm of the substage of the microscope.\r\n\r\n_Skin Ulcers and Similar Sores._--Scrapings are made from the edge of\r\nthe sore, mixed with sterile physiological salt solution, and prepared\r\nand examined as above.\r\n\r\n_Fæces._--A small portion of fæces, or flakes of mucus (which may be\r\nblood-stained) from the same, is removed on a sterile platinum loop,\r\nspread out thinly after dilution, if necessary, with physiological salt\r\nsolution on a slide, covered and examined as before.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, hanging drop preparations of blood, ulcerative tissue,\r\nor fæces, appropriately diluted if necessary with sodium citrate or\r\nphysiological salt solution, may be made on a cover-slip, which is\r\ninverted over a slide with a well in it. The cover-slip is then luted\r\nand examined.\r\n\r\nFor the elucidation of the developmental processes of such organisms\r\nas trypanosomes, spirochætes and piroplasms, fresh preparations may\r\nbe often kept under observation longer by the use of a thermostat,\r\nmaintained at or near blood heat, in which the microscope is inserted.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Intra vitam Staining of fresh Preparations._\r\n\r\n_Intra vitam_ staining is of service on some occasions, more\r\nparticularly for the study of the nucleus and other chromatoid\r\nsubstances of the living organism. Two methods are in common use. In\r\nthe first case, the stain, employed usually in very dilute solution,\r\nis mixed with the medium containing the organism. The latter takes up\r\nsome of the stain, the amount of coloration depending on the organism\r\nconcerned and on the stain employed.\r\n\r\nThe commoner _intra vitam_ stains are pure, medicinal (zinc-free)\r\nmethylene blue and neutral red, used in aqueous solutions. A solution\r\nof methylene blue of 1 per 1,000 of water may be tried, while neutral\r\nred in the proportion of 1 per 3,000 parts of water has proved of\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThe second method of vital colouring consists in placing a drop of\r\n1 per cent. solution of methylene blue on a slide or cover-slip,\r\nslightly spreading it, and allowing it to dry. The living organism is\r\nthen placed in a drop of saline on the prepared slide or cover-slip,\r\nwhich is then mounted and examined under the microscope. Progressive\r\nstaining of the organism occurs and its internal structure can be seen.\r\nA similar procedure may be followed for neutral red. _Intra vitam_\r\nstaining is useful for relatively large and easily deformed protozoa\r\nsuch as ciliates, as well as for amœbæ and flagellata of the gut.\r\n\r\nWhen examining very actively motile organisms, it is sometimes useful\r\nto endeavour to restrict their movements by adding a little gum or\r\ngelatine to the medium.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Examination by aid of the Paraboloid Condenser._\r\n\r\nThe use of one of the dark-ground illuminators (so-called\r\nultra-microscopes) is of service for the detection of minute living\r\norganisms or of organisms present in small numbers only. The forms of\r\nparaboloid condenser manufactured by the firms of Zeiss and Leitz can\r\nbe recommended. For details of their methods of employment, reference\r\nshould be made to the leaflets of the firms supplying the said\r\ninstruments. By the use of the paraboloid condenser, the finer details\r\nof certain stages of life-cycles, such as the formation of granules in\r\nspirochætes and treponemata, can be observed more readily than by using\r\nthe ordinary substage of the microscope. The use of the paraboloid\r\ncondenser for the detection of small numbers of living organisms\r\nrenders it of value for rapid diagnostic purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nStained Material.\r\n\r\nFuller accounts of the technique of fixed and stained material will be\r\nfound in Bolles Lee and in Langeron, already mentioned.\r\n\r\n_Thin Films._--For the examination of blood-inhabiting Protozoa, it\r\nis necessary to make first thin films or smears of blood. There are\r\nmany ways of doing this, and opinions differ as to their respective\r\nmerits. A simple method is to take a straight surgical needle about\r\n2 in. long, the eye of which has been removed, and a clean glass slide.\r\nThe patient’s skin is pricked, and when the bead of blood reaches the\r\nsize of a small pin’s head, the slide is applied to the surface of the\r\nblood, about 1/3 in. from the far (left-hand) end of the slide. The\r\nshaft of the needle is laid across the drop of blood, which spreads\r\nbetween the slide and the needle. The latter is drawn evenly along the\r\nslide towards the right. The film is dried by waving it in the air. The\r\nfilm should possess a straight edge parallel with that of the slide and\r\nshould be as uniform and thin as possible. Another glass slide may be\r\nused as a spreader, or a cover-slip or thin glass rod may be employed.\r\n\r\n_Thick Films._--These are of service in detecting malarial parasites\r\nor trypanosomes, especially when the parasites are few. The method\r\nof Ross, or a modification thereof, has been much used. A small drop\r\nof fresh blood is spread evenly and quickly with a needle-point\r\nover a square area somewhat less than that of an ordinary square\r\ncover-glass. The blood is allowed to dry. The film is then carefully\r\ndehæmoglobinized in water in which there is a trace of acetic acid.\r\nThe dehæmoglobinizing fluid is then carefully drained off and the\r\nfilm again dried. It is fixed in absolute alcohol and stained with\r\nRomanowsky’s solution. A cubic millimetre of blood divided into\r\nquarters may be thus dehæmoglobinized and stained. The parasites in\r\nsuch a cubic millimetre of blood may be counted. Such a procedure was\r\nfollowed by R. Ross and D. Thomson,[1282] in determining the periodic\r\nvariation of the numbers of trypanosomes in the blood of a patient, as\r\nmentioned and figured on pp. 78 and 79.\r\n\r\n[1282] _Proc. Roy. Soc._, B, lxxxii, p. 411.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor cytological details of various Protozoa, thin film preparations on\r\ncover-slips or slides are often useful. Cover-slip preparations are\r\npreferable, unless the organisms under investigation are extremely\r\nscanty. The medium containing the organisms, such as blood, lymph,\r\nintestinal contents, sputum, scrapings of ulcers, and urine, is spread\r\nthinly, either alone or diluted with a little physiological salt\r\nsolution, on the cover-slip. Fixation while still _wet_ is necessary.\r\nVarious methods are employed.\r\n\r\n*Fixatives.*--A useful procedure is to fix the wet film by exposure to\r\n4 per cent. osmic acid vapour for ten to thirty seconds, then place in\r\nabsolute alcohol for five minutes to harden. Grade down from absolute\r\nalcohol through 90 per cent., 70 per cent., 50 per cent., and 30 per\r\ncent. alcohols to water. Stain wet with a suitable stain such as\r\nhæmatoxylin, and gradually dehydrate by grading through the necessary\r\nstrengths of alcohol, clear in xylol or other oily clearing medium and\r\nmount in Canada balsam.\r\n\r\nOther fixatives may be employed, such as are also useful for fixing\r\npieces of tissue for sectioning. Films or smears on cover-slips while\r\n_still wet_ are floated on the surface of the fixative in a watch\r\nglass. Some good fixatives of wide application are:--\r\n\r\n_Schaudinn’s Fluid._--This consists of a mixture of\r\n\r\n  Saturated aqueous solution of corrosive sublimate   2 volumes\r\n  Absolute alcohol                                    1 volume\r\n\r\nTwo modifications of Schaudinn’s formula may be found useful. A\r\nsaturated solution of corrosive sublimate in physiological salt\r\nsolution may be substituted for the aqueous one, and the addition of a\r\nfew drops of glacial acetic acid to either of the preceding mixtures\r\nmay be made.\r\n\r\nSome workers prefer to use hot fixatives, raised to a temperature of\r\nabout 50° C.\r\n\r\nFixation by corrosive sublimate solutions must be followed by thorough\r\nremoval of the mercury salt by washing repeatedly in 30 per cent.\r\nalcohol or with iodine-alcohol.\r\n\r\n_Bouin’s Fluid_, or modifications thereof, is also very useful for wet\r\nfixation. Bouin’s picro-formol solution consists of:--\r\n\r\n  Saturated aqueous solution of picric acid          30 volumes\r\n  Formalin, 40 per cent.                             10    \"\r\n  Acetic acid, glacial                                2    \"\r\n\r\nThe best-known modification is one due to Duboscq and Brasil, and often\r\nknown as _Bouin-Duboscq Fluid_. Its formula is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Alcohol, 80 per cent.                             150 c.c.\r\n  Formalin, 40 per cent.                             60  \"\r\n  Acetic acid, glacial                               15  \"\r\n  Picric acid                                         1 grm.\r\n\r\nThorough washing of the smear or cover-slip preparation with 70 per\r\ncent. alcohol until the yellow colour disappears is necessary to remove\r\nexcess of fixative.\r\n\r\nOther fixatives, which may be of use, more especially for fixing\r\nsmall pieces of tissue for sectioning, are the solutions of Flemming\r\n(chromo-aceto-osmic acids) and of Zenker (sublimate-bichromate-acetic,\r\nwith sodium sulphate).\r\n\r\nRegarding the time of fixation, there is much difference of opinion.\r\nUsually, exposure to or contact with the fixative for five minutes\r\nis sufficient in the case of films or smears. Material for sections\r\nshould be cut into small cubic pieces, of a thickness of about 5 mm.\r\n(1/5 in.). One or two hours should be sufficient time for the fixation\r\nof such pieces of tissue, though some, as Langeron, prefer a longer\r\ntime of fixation. On the other hand, Gustav Mann[1283] recommends a\r\nshort fixation period. The excess of fixative should be thoroughly\r\nwashed out of the tissue in the manner appropriate to the particular\r\nfixative used. If it is desired to keep the tissue for some time before\r\nsectioning and staining, it should be transferred to 70 per cent.\r\nalcohol.\r\n\r\n[1283] “Physiological Histology,” 1902, Clarendon Press, Oxford.\r\n\r\nWhen fluid fixatives are employed, large quantities of the fixing media\r\nare necessary. The volume of the fixative should be at least ten to\r\ntwenty times that of the object, and the latter should be suspended\r\nin the middle of the fixative. The tissue should be fixed as soon as\r\npossible after the death of the host.\r\n\r\nFor sectioning tissue parasitized by Protozoa, embedding in paraffin\r\nis generally recommended. Microtome sections should not, if possible,\r\nexceed 5 µ in thickness. Details of special procedures must be sought\r\nin larger works.\r\n\r\n*Staining.*--Here, as with fixatives, much choice is presented. The\r\nvarious modifications of the Romanowsky stain have aided greatly in\r\nthe detection of various Protozoa parasitic in the blood. Such stains,\r\nhowever, leave something to be desired in the revealing of finer\r\ncytological details. Other stains, more especially the hæmatoxylins,\r\nmust be employed for cytological purposes.\r\n\r\nFormulæ of some of the principal Romanowsky and hæmatoxylin stains may\r\nnow be given.\r\n\r\nThe underlying principle of the _Romanowsky Stain_ is the reaction\r\nbetween alkaline methylene blue and eosin, forming the so-called\r\neosinate of methylene blue which stains chromatin purplish-red. A\r\nsolution of medicinal methylene blue after having been subjected to the\r\naction of an alkali, such as sodium carbonate, becomes partly converted\r\ninto certain derivatives, the chief of which are methylene azure\r\nand methylene violet. These substances are also present in matured\r\npolychrome methylene blue.\r\n\r\nThe formula of a _slightly modified Romanowsky Stain_ which gives\r\nexcellent results is given below:--\r\n\r\n  Two stock solutions are required--\r\n\r\n  Solution A.--Methylene blue, pure medicinal         1·0 grm.\r\n               Sodium carbonate                       0·5  \"\r\n               Water                                100·0 c.c.\r\n\r\n  Keep in a warm incubator for two or three days, until the solution is\r\n  distinctly purple in colour. It improves with age.\r\n\r\n  Solution B.--Eosin, water soluble, extra B.A.       1·0 grm.\r\n               Water                              1,000·0 c.c.\r\n\r\n  This solution must be kept in the dark, in dark-tinted\r\n  (amber-coloured) bottles, as unfortunately it is decolorized by light.\r\n\r\nBefore use each stock solution must be diluted. Thus, make up 5 c.c.\r\nof each stock solution to 100 c.c. by adding distilled water. For\r\nstaining, 1 volume of solution A is added to 2 or 3 volumes of\r\nsolution B. Mix thoroughly by shaking, pour the mixture over the film,\r\npreviously fixed in absolute alcohol, and stain for ten to fifteen\r\nminutes. Wash carefully in running water, then dry. The cytoplasm of a\r\nprotozoan parasite will be stained blue, the chromatin purplish-red and\r\nvacuoles or very tenuous protoplasm will remain colourless.\r\n\r\nThe exact proportions of solutions A and B, which must be mixed\r\ntogether, should be determined by experiment. Freshly mixed stain must\r\nbe used on each occasion.\r\n\r\n_Leishman’s Stain_ is the precipitate resulting from the interaction\r\nof alkaline methylene blue and eosin. The washed and dried precipitate\r\nis collected and dissolved in pure methyl alcohol, which acts as a\r\nfixative; 0·015 grm. of Leishman powder may be dissolved in 10 c.c.\r\nof methyl alcohol for staining films. The film is covered with the\r\nsolution for one minute, twice the volume of water is then added and\r\nmixed with the stain on the slide. The staining is then continued for\r\nfive to ten minutes, and the film is finally washed with water.\r\n\r\n_Giemsa’s Stain._--This should be procured ready made. Azure II is a\r\nmixture of methylene azure and methylene blue. (Methylene azure is\r\nsometimes known as Giemsa’s Azure I.) The formula given by Giemsa\r\nhimself in 1912 is:--\r\n\r\n  Azure II-eosin                                      3·0 grm.\r\n  Azure II                                            0·8  \"\r\n  Glycerine, pure                                   125·0  \"\r\n  Methyl alcohol, pure                              375·0  \"\r\n\r\nThe film is first fixed in absolute alcohol. The proportion of stain\r\nusually used is one drop of stain to 1 c.c. of water. Stain for about\r\nten minutes and then wash in water.\r\n\r\nThe details of the application of the Giemsa stain to films fixed wet\r\nand to sections must be sought in larger works on technique. These\r\nworks should also be consulted for information regarding the use of\r\nPappenheim’s Panchrome mixture.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are numerous formulae of stains containing ripened _Hæmatoxylin_\r\nor its essential principle, _Hæmatein_. A mordant is necessary, one of\r\nthe alums being usually employed. The mordant may be included as an\r\ningredient in the staining mixture, or it may be used separately as in\r\nthe case of the so-called iron-hæmatoxylins, wherein ferric ammonium\r\nalum is used separately and is followed by staining with hæmatoxylin\r\nor hæmatein. A few of these stains of general application may now be\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n_Delafield’s (or Grenachier’s) Hæmatoxylin._\r\n\r\n  Hæmatoxylin crystals                                4 grm.\r\n  Absolute alcohol                                   25 c.c.\r\n  Saturated aqueous solution of ammonia-alum        400  \"\r\n\r\n  Mix these ingredients, and leave exposed to light and air for three\r\n  to four days. Filter and add--\r\n\r\n  Glycerine                                         100 c.c.\r\n  Methyl alcohol                                    100  \"\r\n\r\nAllow the mixture to stand until the colour is sufficiently deep,\r\nthen filter and place in a stoppered bottle. The solution should be\r\nallowed to ripen for at least two months before use. Dilute aqueous\r\nsolutions of the stain are of service for films and for sections. A\r\ntrace of acetic acid may be added at the moment of use, for sharp\r\ndifferentiation.\r\n\r\nEhrlich’s acid hæmatoxylin, Mayer’s hæmalum, and Mayer’s glychæmalum\r\nare also useful. Their formulæ will be found in larger works.\r\n\r\nThe chief _Iron-Hæmatoxylin Stain_ is that devised by Heidenhain.\r\nUnfortunately the procedure involved is a long one, and various\r\nmodifications have been made to obviate this disadvantage. Hæmatein may\r\nbe used instead of ripened hæmatoxylin.\r\n\r\nOne efficacious modification of Heidenhain’s stain is that of\r\n_Rosenbusch_. The smear or tissue, after fixation, must be graded\r\ndownwards through the alcohols to water. Mordant for one and a half\r\nhours in a 3-1/2 per cent. aqueous solution of ferric ammonium\r\nsulphate. Stain for about three minutes in 1 per cent. solution of ripe\r\nhæmatoxylin or hæmatein in absolute or 96 per cent. alcohol, to which\r\na drop of saturated aqueous solution of lithium carbonate, sufficient\r\nto produce a wine-red colour, has been added. Differentiate under the\r\nmicroscope with a very dilute solution of the ferric ammonium sulphate.\r\nWash, gradually dehydrate, clear and mount in balsam. It must be\r\nremarked that iron-hæmatoxylin is a regressive stain, hence great care\r\nmust be exercised in differentiating with the iron alum.\r\n\r\n_Gentian Violet._--A 1 per cent. alcoholic solution of gentian violet,\r\nor of methyl violet, or of crystal violet, will be found useful for\r\nstaining spirochætes.\r\n\r\n_Methyl Green._--This substance is considered to be a chromatin stain,\r\nfor either fresh or perhaps recently fixed tissues. A concentrated\r\naqueous solution contains about 1 per cent. of the stain. This should\r\nbe added to a 1 per cent. solution of acetic acid. It may be used for\r\ndemonstrating the nuclei of ciliates.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn conclusion it is essential to remember that the actual magnification\r\nof figures of Protozoa should be given, and not merely the combination\r\nof objective and ocular that has been used, for unless the tube-length\r\nand distance of the drawing board from the ocular be also given, it\r\nis not possible to compute the magnification from such information.\r\nDrawings should always be made with the aid of a camera lucida, drawing\r\nprism or other form of projection apparatus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX ON TREMATODA AND NEMATODA.\r\n\r\nBY\r\n\r\nJ. W. W. STEPHENS, M.D., B.C., D.P.H.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREMATODA.\r\n\r\n*Artyfechinostomum sufrartyfex*, Clayton Lane, 1915.--Leiper thinks\r\nthis may be the same as _Echinostoma malayanum_, Leiper, 1911, which\r\nspecies Odhner assigns to the genus Euparyphium.\r\n\r\n*Metagonimus* (_Yokogawa_) *yokogawai* occurs in dogs in Shanghai.\r\nEncysted cercariæ probably in the perch.\r\n\r\n*Opisthorchis sp.*--Skin covered with spines. Gut forks almost reach\r\nend of body. Œsophagus two to three times length of pharynx. Ovary\r\nmultilobed. Ovary and testes in posterior fourth of body. Vitellaria\r\nend opposite the ovary. Distinguished from _O. felineus_ by presence of\r\nspines and lobed ovary; from _O. pseudofelineus_ and _O. noverca_ by\r\nthe lobed ovary, and by the fact that the yolk glands do not extend as\r\nfar as the anterior testis. It agrees with Poirier’s description of _O.\r\nviverrini_ in the Indian civet cat, but whether this species has spines\r\non the cuticle is not known.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Man in Chiengmai (Malay States). Fifteen per cent. of\r\nprisoners in the jail showed the ova of this species in their fæces.\r\n\r\n\r\nSchistosome cercariæ.\r\n\r\n*Schistosome cercariæ* belong to the furcocercous division of the\r\n_Distomata_ cercariæ.\r\n\r\n\r\nDistomata cercariæ.\r\n\r\n_Body_ without a floating membrane. Tail absent, or if present not\r\ncleft to the base. Mouth anterior, gut forked. Oral sucker present.\r\nVentral sucker near middle of body. Eyes generally absent.\r\n\r\n\r\nGroup *Fercocercous cercariæ*.\r\n\r\nCercariæ single (not in colonies). Tail forked at its end.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily. *Schistosomidæ.*\r\n\r\nPharynx absent.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Cercaria bilharzia*, Leiper, 1915.\r\n\r\nPigment spots (eyes) anterior to ventral sucker absent, cuticular keel\r\non forks of tail absent.\r\n\r\nIn _Bullinus_ sp. and _Planorbis boissyi_ in Egypt, (?) in _Physopsis\r\nafricana_, South Africa. Adult form, _Schistosoma hæmatobium_.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Cercaria bilharziella*, Leiper, 1915.\r\n\r\nCuticular keel on tail forks present. Pigment spots (eyes) in front of\r\nventral sucker present.\r\n\r\nIn _Planorbis boissyi_ and _P. mareoticus_, and in _Melania_ sp. Adult\r\nform (?).\r\n\r\nFor characters of numerous other cercariæ which occur in fresh water\r\nmolluscs _see_ “Die Susswasserfauna Deutschlands,” Max Lühe, H. 17\r\n(Gustav Fischer, Jena, 1909).\r\n\r\nThe characters of _Cercaria japonica_ of _S. japonicum_ in the mollusc\r\n_Katayama nosophora_ and of _C. mansoni_ have still to be defined.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Schistosoma mansoni*, Sambon, 1907.\r\n\r\nThe evidence appears to be strong that terminal-spined eggs are not\r\nfound in the West Indies, and that therefore the lateral-spined eggs\r\nfound in fæces there belong probably to _S. mansoni_. If this be true,\r\nthen the egg described by Stephens and Christophers in man in India\r\nprobably also belongs to another species of Schistosome.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEMATODA.\r\n\r\n*Ancylostomiasis.*--Treatment: (1) _Oleum chenopodii_ (U.S.P.), dose\r\n♏ x to ♏ xv on a lump of sugar, three doses at two-hourly intervals,\r\npreceded and followed by a purge. It is cheap, not unpleasant to take,\r\nand non-toxic. Effective also against _Ascaris lumbricoides_.\r\n\r\n(2) Milk of the higueron _Ficus laurifolia_. A spoonful in milk, three\r\ntimes daily for three days followed by a purge. Described as a harmless\r\nbut very successful form of treatment.\r\n\r\n*Ground-itch.*--Completely cured in a few days by a 3 per cent.\r\nsolution of salicylic acid in ethyl alcohol. Apply for five minutes\r\ntwice daily.\r\n\r\n*Ascaris lumbricoides* can be kept alive for twelve days in Kronecker’s\r\nsolution; NaOH 0·069 grammes, normal saline 1,000 c.c.\r\n\r\nEggs are laid and develop in about a fortnight at ordinary room\r\ntemperature. At 70° C. they are readily killed.\r\n\r\n*Filariasis.*--Dutcher and Whitmarsh have cultivated from the blood\r\nand from the exudation fluids of cases of filariasis (elephantiasis,\r\nlymphangitis, etc.), in about sixteen cases, a bacillus resembling _B.\r\nsubtilis_. Controls were negative. They propose the name _Bacillus\r\nlymphangiticus_ for this organism, and they believe it to be the cause\r\nof the diseases grouped under the designation “filariasis.”\r\n\r\n*Oncocerca volvulus.*--_Unsheathed_ embryos (indistinguishable from\r\nthose taken from the uterus of this worm) have been found in lymphatic\r\nglands and in the blood (if considerable pressure is used so as to\r\nsqueeze out lymph at the time of taking the finger blood, otherwise\r\nnone occurs in the specimens). The measurements in dried films are:\r\nNerve ring 23·7 per cent. of length; G1 cell 69·6 per cent.; end of\r\nlast tail cell 96·3 per cent; total length 274·3 µ.\r\n\r\n*Strongyloides stercoralis.*--Pathology: They occur in the wall of the\r\nintestine and may be associated with ulceration. They also occur in\r\nlymphatics and blood-vessels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[In the following pages the letters C. f. B., P. u.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks."
