C**** DE L***.\r\n\r\n“I have observed the Manners of the Times, and have\r\nwrote those Letters.”\r\n\r\nJ. J. Rousseau, Pref. to the New Eloise.\r\n\r\nSECOND EDITION.\r\nIN FOUR VOLUMES.\r\n\r\nVOL. I.\r\n\r\nLondon:\r\nPRINTED FOR J. EBERS, OLD BOND STREET.\r\n1812\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nFROM THE\r\nEDITOR.\r\n\r\nWe think it incumbent on us to acquaint the Public, notwithstanding the\r\ntitle of this work, and what the Compiler asserts in his preface, that\r\nwe do not pledge ourselves for the authenticity of this Collection, and\r\nthat we have even very forcible reasons to believe it a fiction.\r\n\r\nNay, that the author, who seems studiously to have sought nature, has\r\nhimself awkwardly defeated his intention, by the epocha in which he\r\nhas placed his events. The morals of several of his personages are so\r\ncorrupt, that it is impossible they should have existed in this age;\r\nan age of philosophy, and in which an extensive diffusion of knowledge\r\nhas had the happy effect to render the men famed for morality and\r\nintegrity, and the female sex for reserve and modesty.\r\n\r\nWe are therefore inclined to think, if the adventures related in this\r\nwork have any foundation in truth, they must have happened at some\r\nother time and place: and we blame the author much, who, probably\r\nseduced by the hope of interesting us the more, has dared to modernize\r\nand to decorate, with our usages and customs, morals to which we are\r\nutter strangers.\r\n\r\nTo preserve, at least, the too credulous reader, as much as in our\r\npower, from all surprise on this subject, we will strengthen our\r\nopinion with an unanswerable argument; for though similar causes never\r\nfail to produce the same effects, yet we cannot now find a young\r\nlady, with an estate of 60,000 livres a year, take the veil, nor a\r\nPresidente, in the bloom of youth and beauty, die of grief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Work, or rather Collection, which the Public will, perhaps, still\r\nfind too voluminous, contains but a small part of the correspondence\r\nfrom which it is extracted. Being appointed to arrange it by the\r\npersons in whose possession it was, and who, I knew, intended it for\r\npublication, I asked, for my sole recompence, the liberty to reject\r\nevery thing that appeared to me useless, and I have endeavoured to\r\npreserve only the letters which appeared necessary to illustrate\r\nthe events, or to unfold the characters. If to this inconsiderable\r\nshare in the work be added an arrangement of those letters which I\r\nhave preserved, with a strict attention to dates, and some short\r\nannotations, calculated, for the most part, to point out some\r\ncitations, or to explain some retrenchments I have made, the Public\r\nwill see the extent of my labours, and the part I have taken in this\r\npublication.\r\n\r\nI have also changed, or suppressed, the names of the personages, and\r\nif, among those I have substituted, any resemblance may be found which\r\nmight give offence, I beg it may be looked on as an unintentional error.\r\n\r\nI proposed farther alterations, as to purity of style and diction, in\r\nboth which many faults will be found. I could also have wished to have\r\nbeen authorised to shorten some long letters, several of which treat\r\nseparately, and almost without transition, of objects totally foreign\r\nto one another. This liberty, in which I was not indulged, would\r\nnot have been sufficient to give merit to the work, but would have\r\ncorrected part of its defects.\r\n\r\nIt was objected to me, that the intention was to publish the letters\r\nthemselves, and not a work compiled from the letters; that it would\r\nbe as distant from probability as truth, that eight or ten persons,\r\nwho were concerned in this correspondence, should have wrote with\r\nequal purity of style:—And on my representing that there was not one\r\nwhich did not abound with essential faults, and was not very open\r\nto criticism, I was answered, that every reasonable reader would\r\nundoubtedly expect to find faults in a collection of letters of private\r\npersons, since among all those hitherto published by authors of the\r\nhighest reputation, and even some academicians, there are none totally\r\nexempt from censure. Those reasons have not convinced me; and I am\r\nstill of opinion they are easier to give than likely to obtain assent;\r\nbut I had not my option, and submitted, reserving only the liberty of\r\nentering my protest, and declaring my dissent, as I now do.\r\n\r\nAs to the merit of this work, perhaps it does not become me to touch\r\nupon it; my opinion neither can, or ought, to influence any one.\r\nHowever, as some wish to know something of a book before they take it\r\nin hand, those who are so disposed will proceed with this preface—the\r\nrest will do better to pass on to the work itself.\r\n\r\nThough inclined to publish those letters, I am yet far from thinking\r\nthey will meet success; and let not this sincere declaration be\r\nconstrued into the affected modesty of an author: for I declare, with\r\nthe same frankness, that if I had thought this collection an unworthy\r\noffering to the Public, it should not have taken up any part of my\r\ntime.—Let us try to reconcile this apparent contradiction.\r\n\r\nThe merit of a work consists in its utility, or its agreeableness,\r\nand even in both, when it admits of both. But success, which is not\r\nalways the criterion of merit, often arises more from a choice of\r\nsubject than the execution, more from the aggregate of the objects\r\npresented than the manner of treating them: such a collection as the\r\ntitle announces this to be, being the letters of a whole circle, and\r\ncontaining a diversity of interests, is not likely to fix the attention\r\nof the reader. Besides, the sentiments they contain being feigned or\r\ndissembled, can only excite an interest of curiosity, always infinitely\r\ninferior to that of sentiment, and less disposed to indulgence, as well\r\nas more apt to be struck with defects in the narrative, as they are\r\nconstantly in opposition to the only desire curiosity seeks to gratify.\r\nThese defects are, perhaps, partly compensated by the quality of the\r\nwork; I mean the variety of style—A merit which an author seldom\r\nattains, but which here presents itself, and prevents, at least, a dull\r\nuniformity. Perhaps merit may also be allowed to many observations,\r\neither new or little known, which are interspersed through those\r\nletters: and this, to pass the most favourable judgment on them, will\r\nbe found to constitute their best pretension to pleasing.\r\n\r\nThe utility of the work, which will, perhaps, be more strongly\r\ncontested, appears more easy to establish: it is at least useful to\r\nmorality, to lay open the means used by the wicked to seduce the\r\ninnocent; and those letters will efficaciously concur for so salutary\r\na purpose. There will also be found in them the proof and example of\r\ntwo important truths, which one would be apt to think unknown, seeing\r\nhow little they are practised: the one, that every woman who admits a\r\nbad man to her society, ends with becoming his victim; the other, that\r\nevery mother is at least imprudent, that suffers any but herself to\r\ngain possession of her daughter’s confidence.\r\n\r\nYoung persons, of both sexes, may also here learn, that the\r\nfriendship so readily held out to them by people of bad morals,\r\nis ever a dangerous snare, equally fatal to their happiness and\r\nvirtue; yet, abuse or evil always unhappily confining too nearly on\r\ngood, appears so much to be dreaded in this respect, that far from\r\nrecommending the perusal of works of this kind to youth, I think it\r\nof the utmost importance to keep all such very far from their reach.\r\nThe time when productions of the nature of the present may be no\r\nlonger dangerous, but begin to be useful, was fixed by a lady of\r\ngreat good understanding. “I think,” said she to me, after having\r\nread the manuscript of this correspondence, “I should render my\r\ndaughter an essential service in putting this book in her hands on\r\nher wedding-day.” Should all mothers think thus, I shall congratulate\r\nmyself on having published it.\r\n\r\nYet I shall leave this flattering supposition at a distance; and I\r\nstill think this collection will please but few.—Men and women of\r\ndepraved minds will take an interest in discountenancing a work that\r\nmay injure them; and as they are never wasting in ingenuity, they may\r\nbring over the whole class of rigorists, who will be alarmed at the\r\npicture we have dared to present of profligacy.\r\n\r\nThe pretenders to free thinking will take no concern in the fate of a\r\ndevout woman, whom, for that reason, they will not fail to pronounce\r\nweak, whilst the devotee will be displeased to see virtue sink under\r\nmisfortune, and will complain that religion does not sufficiently\r\ndisplay its power. On the other hand, persons of a delicate taste\r\nwill be disgusted with the simplicity and defective style of many of\r\nthe letters, whilst the generality of readers, led away with the idea\r\nthat every thing that appears in print is a work of labour, will think\r\nhe sees in some of the other letters the laboured style of an author\r\nsufficiently apparent, notwithstanding the disguise he has assumed.\r\n\r\nTo conclude; it will be pretty generally said, that a thing is little\r\nworth out of its place; and that if the too correct style of authors\r\ntakes off from the gracefulness of miscellaneous letters, negligences\r\nin these become real faults, and make them insupportable when\r\nconsigned to the press.\r\n\r\nI sincerely own that those reproaches may have some foundation. I\r\nbelieve also, I might possibly be able to answer them, even without\r\nexceeding the length of a preface: but it is clear, that were I to\r\nattempt to answer every thing, I could do nothing else; and that if I\r\nhad deemed it requisite to do so, I should at once have suppressed both\r\npreface and book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT\r\nFROM THE\r\nCORRESPONDENCE\r\nON WHAT CONCERNS THE\r\nHAPPINESS OF MAN AND SOCIETY.\r\n[No. III.]\r\nTHE UTILITY OF NOVELS.\r\nTHE NOVEL OF\r\nDANGEROUS CONNECTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre novels useful, or are they prejudicial to the morals? is a question\r\nlong agitated, and not yet resolved; for the reasons on both sides\r\nare equally plausible. Undoubtedly Richardson, who is read and cited\r\nevery where, though prolix and diffuse, has not a little contributed\r\nto the practice of pure morality; and yet, on the other hand, what\r\nmischiefs have been produced by the immense multitude of novels of\r\nall sorts with which France and all Europe have been overrun for some\r\nyears past; and, as if the evil done by these temporary plagues was not\r\nsufficiently accomplished during their short existence, it is prolonged\r\nby reviving them in eternal collections. A novel, the morality of which\r\nis equivocal, is a very dangerous poison; a novel that only possesses\r\nmediocrity, is at best useless. Even a good novel is but aliment for a\r\nchild, or some weak being, to whom morality unadorned is a disgusting\r\nobject. Hence we may conclude, that every thinking man will take care\r\nto banish this kind of works from his library.\r\n\r\nHe will then likewise proscribe that novel, now so much prized,\r\ncalled _Dangerous Connections, or Letters collected in a Society, and\r\npublished for the Instruction of other Societies_.\r\n\r\nAfter having read a few pages of this work, one is almost led to think\r\nthis title a piece of pleasantry; the letters of Madame de Merteuil,\r\nand of the Viscount de Valmont, _published_ truly _for the instruction\r\nof society_. Is it in order to form people to the detestable art of\r\nseduction, or to inspire them with a horror of it? and yet this work\r\nhas been censured, and approved; has had all the honours of war, while\r\nso many other useful works are like the manes of the ancients, to whom\r\na sepulchre was denied, and who were forced to wander upon the gloomy\r\nbanks of the Styx, and admitted only by stealth. _O cæcas hominum\r\nmentes!_\r\n\r\nI am far from a wish to calumniate the author, who, I am assured, is\r\na military man of the highest character for wit and good conduct; but\r\nhis work, which seems to have a moral end in view, is in reality very\r\ndangerous. It has been said to be a picture of the manners of a certain\r\nclass in society; and, if it was not a resemblance, where would be\r\nits utility? Must monsters be created to cause in us an aversion of\r\nordinary vices? If it is true, it ought to have been concealed; there\r\nare shocking nudities which our minds revolt at rather than receive\r\nany instruction from. The veil that covers the Tiberiuses and the\r\nMessalinas, ought not to be wholly lifted up.\r\n\r\nYoung men will find in this novel easy means of seduction; young women\r\nwill here see portraits of embellished vice; and old libertines will\r\nbe amused by the exploits of Valmont. But what a monster is Valmont,\r\nif such a character exists; and those who know that class of society,\r\nassure us, they have met with many such. If there really are such\r\nbeings, ought not their society to be avoided carefully? It is a forest\r\nfilled with robbers: to enter it we should be well armed. It is a road\r\nfull of great precipices, to avoid falling into which, we must be very\r\ncircumspect.\r\n\r\nWhat a character is the Marchioness de Merteuil! Sometimes she is a\r\nMedea, sometimes a Messalina. Read the tenth letter: vice is to be\r\ndrawn; but should it be drawn in such seducing colours? Are there many\r\nyoung people who will prefer the character of a virtuous man to the\r\nbrilliant and lively one of the profligate Valmont? Are there many who\r\nwill not blush at the awkwardness of Cecilia? And when one blushes at\r\nbeing ridiculed, they are not very far from the vice that exempts them\r\nfrom it. In France, ridicule is too much dreaded; they would rather be\r\nvicious; and this book will rather assist that taste.\r\n\r\nThe style of romances may serve to lead us to the knowledge of the\r\nmorals of ages and nations. Thus the country, which has lately produced\r\nthe natural and moving _Henrietta of Gerstenfeld_, is far from the\r\nstate of depravity of Paris and London. I form my opinion from the\r\nbook. In the last age the French novels were full of gallantry and\r\nvirtuous love, because then they were gallant and respectful. In this\r\nage, they have substituted wit to love, and the novels are stuffed with\r\nan unintelligible jargon of metaphysics. Of this they grew tired, and\r\nlibertinism succeeded to it. From thence so many licentious romances.\r\nThe immense quantity that are produced is a complete proof of the\r\ncorruption of the age; the rapidity with which they are bought, the\r\nrage with which they are devoured, farther prove this depravation.\r\n\r\nDoing justice to the zeal that seems to animate the author of those\r\nobservations, we may be permitted, I hope, to make some farther\r\nremarks on the manner he has presented his? Before we begin to examine\r\nthe degree of moral utility contained in the novel of _Dangerous\r\nConnections_, the author of the correspondence first begs leave to ask\r\nwhether novels in general are useful or prejudicial to morals? This\r\nmethod is the most prudent; but is it not singular, that, acknowledging\r\nthe indecision of this question, because the reasons for and against\r\nare equally seducing, he is still so bold to condemn, indiscriminately,\r\nall novels, without assigning any new reasons in justification of this\r\ndefinitive sentence? On the contrary, the author asserts, Richardson’s\r\nnovels have been useful to morality, to preserve them in their purity\r\nand in the same breath advises all thinking men to banish them from\r\ntheir libraries! Are the consequences suitable to the premises? Is\r\nnot that confounding the genus with the species? But if it was even\r\ntrue, that the best novel is only food for infancy, or a weak being,\r\nfor whom unadorned morality is a terrifying object, would the author’s\r\ndecision be the more justifiable? I will not determine; but I would ask\r\nwhat he means by those _thinking_ men, for whom unadorned morality is\r\nnot terrifying? It would be, perhaps, those declaiming misanthropes,\r\nwho censure and despise every thing that does not bear a resemblance\r\nto their savage and austere way of thinking? I have sometimes had\r\na good opinion of their understanding, but been ever diffident of\r\ntheir hearts; were we to attend to them, we should also banish from\r\nour libraries the divine poem of Telemachus, which is the first of\r\nnovels, which modest qualification does not hinder it from being, if\r\none may venture to call it, the first of our books; not only by the\r\ngrandeur of the business it treats, but also by the manner in which it\r\nis treated. We should also banish from our libraries even the works of\r\nthe _Correspondence_, the morality of which is become very interesting,\r\nby an ornamented, pure and elegant style; if, notwithstanding those\r\nqualities, this work has its opposers, would it find many readers if it\r\nwas divested of them? God forbid I should ever intend making a general\r\napology for all novels! that would be the idea of a Demoniac; I only\r\nmean to justify useful novels. If any one makes a bad use of this kind\r\nof writing, I most willingly acquiesce in their condemnation. Let us\r\nnow examine whether the author of _Dangerous Connections_ deserves to\r\nsuffer.\r\n\r\nWhat is a novel? A correct picture of morals put in motion.—What\r\nshould be the aim of a novel? To blend instruction with\r\namusement.—When the morals of the actors are corrupt, is it allowable,\r\nwith deference to decency, to draw them in their proper shades and\r\ncolours? Undoubtedly it is; but with the greatest caution, lest by\r\ngiving vice, whose contagion must be dreaded, its true, though seducing\r\nand agreeable aspect, without resisting, diminishing, or rendering\r\nuseless, the effect it may produce by the contrast of gentleness,\r\npeace, and happiness, which virtue secures. The author of the _Errors\r\nof the Heart and Mind_, and the other of the _Confessions of the\r\nCount of ——_, have gone wide of this mark; yet their characters\r\nare drawn after nature; the Meilcourts are still the ornament of\r\nthe Bon Ton societies. But should irregularities be drawn without\r\ninflicting their punishment? Should vice, with impunity, applaud\r\nits infamous triumphs? Should innocence weep without being avenged?\r\nCertainly not. Those novels deserve the severest censure of the author\r\nof the Correspondence; those are the books which should be carefully\r\nconcealed from the busy curiosity of young people. Let any one take\r\nthe trouble to compare the works I have now quoted, and similar ones,\r\nwith the novel of _Dangerous Connections_, shall we not always feel a\r\ncertain aversion, a kind of antipathy for Valmont and the Marchioness\r\nde Merteuil, notwithstanding the brilliant cast he has given two\r\nperformers. Let some attention be paid to the skill with which he\r\nhas contrasted them in the gentle, sensible, and generous Madame de\r\nRosemonde; how moving, how unaffected her virtue. The following letter,\r\nwrote to the victim of the profligate Valmont, is, in my opinion,\r\nalone sufficient to counterbalance, at least, the impression this same\r\nValmont, and the infamous accomplice in his crimes, could make.\r\n\r\n\r\n        LETTER CXXX.\r\n\r\n        _Madame de_ Rosemonde, _to the Presidente de_ Tourvel.\r\n\r\n\r\n        “Why, my lovely dear, will you no longer be my daughter?\r\n        Why do you seem to announce that our correspondence is\r\n        to cease?[1] Is it to punish me for not guessing at\r\n        what was improbable; or do you suspect me of creating\r\n        you affliction designedly? I know your heart too well,\r\n        to imagine you would entertain such an opinion of\r\n        mine.—The distress your letter plunges me in is much\r\n        less on my own account than yours. Oh! my young friend,\r\n        with grief I tell you, you are too worthy of being\r\n        beloved ever to be happy in love. Where is there a truly\r\n        delicate and sensible woman, who has not met unhappiness\r\n        where she expected bliss? Do men know how to rate the\r\n        women they possess?\r\n\r\n        “Not but many of them are virtuous in their addresses,\r\n        and constant in their affections—but even among those,\r\n        how few that know how to put themselves in unison\r\n        with our hearts. I do not imagine, my dear child,\r\n        their affection is like ours. They experience the\r\n        same transport often with more violence, but they are\r\n        strangers to that uneasy officiousness, that delicate\r\n        solicitude, that produces in us those continual tender\r\n        cares, whose sole aim is the beloved object. Man enjoys\r\n        the happiness he feels, woman that she gives.\r\n\r\n        “This difference, so essential, and so seldom observed,\r\n        influences, in a very sensible manner, the totality of\r\n        their respective conduct. The pleasure of the one is\r\n        to gratify desires; but that of the other is to create\r\n        them. To know to please is in man the means of success;\r\n        and in woman it is success itself.\r\n\r\n        “And do not imagine the exceptions, be they more or\r\n        less numerous, that may be quoted, can be successfully\r\n        opposed to those general truths, which the voice of the\r\n        public has guarantied, with the only distinction as to\r\n        men of infidelity from inconstancy; a distinction of\r\n        which they avail themselves, and of which they should be\r\n        ashamed; which never has been adopted by any of our sex\r\n        but those of abandoned characters, who are a scandal to\r\n        us, and to whom all methods are acceptable which they\r\n        think may deliver them from the painful sensation of\r\n        their own meanness.\r\n\r\n        “I thought, my lovely dear, those reflections might be\r\n        of use to you, in order to oppose the chimerical ideas\r\n        of perfect happiness, with which love never fails to\r\n        amuse our imagination. Deceitful hope! to which we are\r\n        still attached, even when we find ourselves under the\r\n        necessity of abandoning it—whose loss multiplies and\r\n        irritates our already too real sorrows, inseparable\r\n        from an ardent passion. This task of alleviating your\r\n        trouble, or diminishing their number, is the only one I\r\n        will or can now fulfil. In disorders which are without\r\n        remedy, no other advice can be given, than as to the\r\n        regimen to be observed. The only thing I wish you to\r\n        remember is, that to pity is not to blame a patient.\r\n        Alas! who are we, that we dare blame one another? Let us\r\n        leave the right of judging to the Searcher of hearts;\r\n        and I will even venture to believe, that in his paternal\r\n        sight, a crowd of virtues may compensate a single\r\n        weakness.\r\n\r\n        “But I conjure you, above all things, my dear friend, to\r\n        guard against violent resolutions, which are less the\r\n        effects of fortitude than despondency: do not forget,\r\n        that although you have made another possessor of your\r\n        existence (to use your own expression) you had it not\r\n        in your power to deprive your friends of the share they\r\n        were before possessed of, and which they will always\r\n        claim.\r\n\r\n        “Adieu, my dear child! Think sometimes on your tender\r\n        mother; and be assured you always will be, above every\r\n        thing, the dearest object of her thoughts.\r\n\r\n        “_Castle of ——._”\r\n\r\nIf the openness of the little Volanges, or her ignorance, should seem\r\nridiculous to those of her own age, the unhappy consequences that\r\nresulted from it, will be an useful lesson to mothers to be cautious\r\nin what hands they intrust the education of their children. But can\r\na young girl, who has once imbibed this bad education, avoid the\r\nconsequences I mention, without any other guide but her timidity and\r\nabsolute ignorance of vice? Is it in a corrupt world, in which she is\r\njust entering, that she will receive the fatal knowledge? Does not\r\nthe author of the Correspondence himself say, “To enter it, we should\r\nbe well armed; it is a road full of precipices: to avoid falling\r\ninto which, we must be very circumspect.” This is all well—But if,\r\nunfortunately, I am blind, or without a guide, who is to restore me\r\nsight, or lead me? I conclude, then, that a young person, who would\r\nbe pleased, at first, with the brilliant character of the Marchioness\r\nde Merteuil, would soon change her opinion, and not be tempted to\r\nimitate her, when she would see the dreadful and examplary punishment\r\ninflicted on this guilty woman. She will shudder at the thought of the\r\nmiseries to which one single fault condemned Cecilia Volanges. Valmont\r\nperishing in the bloom of life, by a violent death, loaded with the\r\ncontempt and disgrace of all men of worth, disowned even by the wicked,\r\nwill deter all those, whose vanity and a desire to shine might induce\r\nthem to copy such a character, from attempting to imitate him.\r\n\r\n(By the ABBÉ KENTZINGER.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See Letter cxxviii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDANGEROUS CONNECTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER I.\r\n\r\nCecilia Volanges _to_ Sophia Carnay, _at the Convent of the Ursulines\r\nof ——._\r\n\r\n\r\nYou see, my dear friend, I keep my word, and that dress does not\r\ntotally take up all my time; I shall ever have some left for you. In\r\nthis single day I have seen more finery of attire, than in the four\r\nyears we have spent together; and I believe the haughty Tanville[1]\r\nwill be more mortified at my first visit, when I shall certainly desire\r\nto see her, than she used to be every time she came to see us _in\r\nfiochi_. Mamma advises with me in every thing; she behaves to me no\r\nlonger as a boarder in a convent. I have a chamber-maid to myself; a\r\nchamber and a closet of my own, and a very pretty scrutoire, of which\r\nI keep the key, and where I can lock up every thing. My Mamma has told\r\nme, I must be with her every morning at her levee; that it would be\r\nsufficient to have my head dressed by dinner, because we should always\r\nbe alone, and that then she would each day tell me what time I should\r\ncome to her apartment in the evening. The remainder of my time is at\r\nmy own disposal; I have my harpsichord, my drawings, and books, just\r\nas in the convent, only that the mother abbess is not here to scold.\r\nAnd I may always be idle, if I please: but as I have not my dear Sophy\r\nto chat and laugh with, I am as well pleased with some occupation.\r\nIt is not yet five, and I am not to go to Mamma till seven: what a\r\ndeal of time, if I had any thing to tell you! but nothing has been\r\nyet mentioned to me of any consequence: and if it were not for the\r\npreparation I see making, and the number of women employed for me, I\r\nshould be apt to think they have no notion of my nuptials, and that it\r\nwas one of old Josephine’s[2] tales. Yet Mamma having so often told\r\nme, that a young lady should remain in a convent, until she was on the\r\npoint of marriage, and having now brought me home, I am apt to think\r\nJosephine right.\r\n\r\nA coach has just stopped at our door, and Mamma has sent for me. If it\r\nshould be my intended!—I am not dressed, and am all in agitation; my\r\nheart flutters. I asked my maid, if she knew who was with my Mamma?\r\n“Why,” says she, laughing, “it is Mr. C——.” I really believe it is\r\nhe. I will certainly return and write you the whole; however, that’s\r\nhis name. I must not make them wait. Adieu, for a moment!\r\n\r\nHow you will laugh at your poor Cecilia, my dear Sophy! I’m quite\r\nashamed! But you would have been deceived as well as I. On entering\r\nMamma’s room, I saw a gentleman in black, standing close by her, I\r\nsaluted him as well as I could, and remained motionless. You may guess,\r\nI examined him from head to foot. “Madam,” said he to Mamma, “this\r\nis a most charming young lady, and I am extremely sensible of your\r\ngoodness.” So positive a declaration made me tremble all over; and\r\nnot being able to support me, I threw myself in an armed chair, quite\r\nred and disconcerted. In an instant he was at my knees, and then you\r\nmay judge how poor Cecilia’s head was bewildered; I instantly started\r\nup and shrieked, just as on the day of the great thunder. Mamma burst\r\nout laughing, saying, “Well, what’s the matter? Sit down, and give Mr.\r\n—— your foot.” Thus, my dear friend, Mr. —— turns out to be my\r\nshoemaker. You can’t conceive how much I was ashamed; happily, there\r\nwas no one but Mamma present. I am, however, resolved when I am married\r\nhe shall not be my shoemaker. Well! am I not now much the wiser?\r\nFarewell! it is almost six, and my maid says it is time to dress.\r\nAdieu! my dear Sophy; I love you as much as I did at the convent.\r\n\r\nP. S. I don’t know whom to send with this, and shall wait till\r\nJosephine calls.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Aug._ 3, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] A boarder in the same convent.\r\n\r\n[2] Josephine was the portress of the convent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER II.\r\n\r\n_The_ Marchioness de Merteuil _to the_ Viscount Valmont, _at the_\r\n_Castle of ——._\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn, my dear Viscount, return! How can you think of idling your days\r\nwith an old aunt, whose fortune is already settled on you! Set out the\r\nmoment you receive this letter, for I want you much. A most enchanting\r\nidea has just struck me, and I wish to confide the execution of it to\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nThis hint should be sufficient, and you should think yourself so highly\r\nhonoured by my choice, as to fly to receive my orders on your knees:\r\nbut my favours are thrown away on one who no longer sets a value on\r\nthem; and you presume upon my kindness, where the alternative must\r\nbe eternal hatred, or excessive indulgence. I will acquaint you with\r\nmy scheme; but you, like a true knight errant, must first swear to\r\nundertake no other adventure until this is achieved. It is worthy\r\na hero. You will at once satiate love and revenge. It will be an\r\nadditional exploit to your memoirs; yes, your memoirs, for I will have\r\nthem published, and I will undertake the task. But to return to what\r\nmore immediately concerns us. Madame de Volanges intends to marry her\r\ndaughter: it is yet a secret; but she yesterday informed me of it. And\r\nwhom do you think she has chosen for her son-in-law? Count Gercourt.\r\nWho could have thought I should have been allied to Gercourt? I am\r\nprovoked beyond expression at your stupidity! Well, don’t you guess\r\nyet? Oh, thou essence of dulness! What, have you then pardoned him the\r\naffair of Madame the Intendante? And I, monster![1] have I not more\r\nreason for revenge? But I shall resume my temper; the prospect of\r\nretaliation, recalls my serenity.\r\n\r\nYou and I have been often tormented with the important idea framed\r\nby Gercourt, of the lady he intended honour with his hand, and his\r\nridiculous presumption of being exempt from the unavoidable fate\r\nof married men. You know his foolish prepossessions in favour of\r\nconventual education, and his still more weak prejudices for women of a\r\nfair complexion: and I really believe, notwithstanding Volanges’ sixty\r\nthousand livres a year, he never would have thought of this girl, had\r\nshe not been black eyed, or not educated in a convent.\r\n\r\nLet us convince him, he is a most egregious fool, as one day or other\r\nhe must be: but that’s not the business; the jest will be, should he\r\nact upon so absurd an opinion. How we should be diverted the next day\r\nwith his boasts! for boast he will: and if once you properly form\r\nthis little girl, it will be astonishing if Gercourt does not become,\r\nlike so many others, the standing ridicule of Paris. The heroine of\r\nthis new romance merits all your attention; she is really handsome,\r\njust turn’d of fifteen, and a perfect rose-bud; awkward as you could\r\nwish, and totally unpolished: but you men don’t mind such trifles;\r\na certain languishing air, which promises a great deal, added to\r\nmy recommendation of her, leaves only to you to thank me and obey.\r\nYou will receive this letter to-morrow morning: I require to see\r\nyou at seven in the evening. I shall not be visible to any one else\r\ntill eight, not even to my chevalier, who happens to be my reigning\r\nfavourite for the present; he has not a head for such great affairs.\r\nYou see I am not blinded by love. I shall set you at liberty at eight,\r\nand you’ll return to sup with the charming girl at ten, for the mother\r\nand daughter sup with me. Farewell! it is past noon. Now for other\r\nobjects.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Aug._ 4, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] To understand this passage, it must be remarked, that the Count de\r\nGercourt had quitted the Marchioness de Merteuil for the Intendante de\r\n——, who had on his account abandoned the Viscount de Valmont, and\r\nthat then the attachment of the Marchioness to the Viscount commenced.\r\nAs that adventure was long antecedent to the events which are the\r\nsubject of these letters, it has been thought better to suppress the\r\nwhole of that correspondence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER III.\r\n\r\nCecilia Volanges _to_ Sophia Carnay.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have yet no news for my dear friend. Mamma had a great deal of\r\ncompany at supper last night. Notwithstanding the strong inclination I\r\nhad to make my observations, especially among the men, I was far from\r\nbeing entertained. The whole company could not keep their eyes from me;\r\nthey whispered; I could observe plainly they were speaking of me, and\r\nthat made me blush; I could not help it: I wish I could; for I observed\r\nwhen any one looked at the other ladies they did not blush, or the\r\nrouge they put on prevented their blushes from being seen. It must be\r\nvery difficult not to change countenance when a man fixes his eyes on\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nWhat gave me the most uneasiness was, not to know what they thought\r\nof me; however, I think I heard the word pretty two or three times:\r\nbut I’m sure I very distinctly heard that of awkward; and that must be\r\nvery true, for she that said so is a relation, and an intimate friend\r\nof Mamma’s. She seems even to have taken a sudden liking to me. She\r\nwas the only person who took a little notice of me the whole evening.\r\nI also heard a man after supper, who I am sure was speaking of me, say\r\nto another, “We must let it ripen, we shall see this winter.” Perhaps\r\nhe is to be my husband; but if so, I have still to wait four months! I\r\nwish I knew how it is to be.\r\n\r\nHere’s Josephine, and she says she is in haste. I must, however, tell\r\nyou one of my awkward tricks—Oh, I believe that lady was right.\r\n\r\nAfter supper, they all sat down to cards. I sat next Mamma. I don’t\r\nknow how it happened, but I fell asleep immediately. A loud laugh\r\nawoke me. I don’t know whether I was the object of it; but I believe I\r\nwas. Mamma gave me leave to retire, which pleas’d me much. Only think,\r\nit was then past eleven! Adieu, my dear Sophy! continue to love thy\r\nCecilia, I assure you the world is not so pleasing as we used to think\r\nit.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Aug._ 4, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER IV.\r\n\r\n_The_ Viscount de Valmont _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour orders are enchanting, and your manner of giving them still more\r\ndelightful; you would even make one in love with despotism. It is not\r\nthe first time, you know, that I regret I am no longer your slave;\r\nand yet, monster as you style me, I recall with rapture the time when\r\nyou honoured me with softer names. I have often even wish’d again to\r\ndeserve them, and to terminate, by giving along with you an example of\r\nconstancy to the world. But matters of greater moment call us forth;\r\nconquest is our destiny, and we must follow it: we may, perhaps,\r\nmeet again at the end of our career; for permit me to say, without\r\nputting you out of temper, my beautiful Marchioness! you follow me\r\nwith a pretty equal pace; and since, for the happiness of the world,\r\nwe have separated to preach the faith, I am inclined to think, that in\r\nthis mission of love, you have made more proselytes than I. I am well\r\nconvinced of your zeal and fervour; and if the God of Love judged us\r\naccording to our works, you would be the patron saint of some great\r\ncity, whilst your friend would be at most a common village saint. This\r\nlanguage no doubt will surprise you; but you must know, that for these\r\neight days I hear and speak no other; and to make myself perfect in it,\r\nI am obliged to disobey you.\r\n\r\nDon’t be angry, and hear me. As you are the depository of all the\r\nsecrets of my heart, I will intrust you with the greatest project I\r\never formed. What do you propose to me? To seduce a young girl, who\r\nhas seen nothing, knows nothing, and would in a manner give herself up\r\nwithout making the least defence, intoxicated with the first homage\r\npaid to her charms, and perhaps incited rather by curiosity than\r\nlove; there twenty others may be as successful as I. Not so with the\r\nenterprise that engrosses my mind; its success insures me as much glory\r\nas pleasure; and even almighty Love, who prepares my crown, hesitates\r\nbetween the myrtle and laurel, or will rather unite them to honour my\r\ntriumph. Even you yourself, my charming friend, will be struck with a\r\nholy respect, and in a fit of enthusiasm, will exclaim, This is the man\r\nafter my own heart!\r\n\r\nYou know the Presidente Tourvel, her devout life, her conjugal\r\nlove, and the austerity of her principles; that is the object I\r\nattack; that is the enemy worthy of me; that is the point I intend to\r\ncarry. I must tell you, the President is in Burgundy, prosecuting a\r\nconsiderable suit, (I hope to make him lose one of greater importance,)\r\nhis inconsolable partner is to remain here the whole time of this\r\nafflicting widowhood. A mass each day, a few visits to the neighbouring\r\npoor, prayers morning and evening, a few solitary walks, pious\r\nconferences with my old aunt, and sometimes a melancholy game at whist,\r\nare her only amusements: but I am preparing some of a more efficacious\r\nnature for her. My guardian angel led me here for our mutual happiness.\r\nFool that I was! I used to regret the time that I sacrificed to the\r\ncustomary ceremonies. How should I now be punished, by being obliged to\r\nreturn to Paris! Fortunately there must be four to make a whist party;\r\nand as there is no one here but the curate of the place, my eternal\r\naunt has pressed me much to sacrifice a few days to her; you may judge,\r\nI did not refuse her. You can’t conceive how much she caresses me ever\r\nsince; and above all, how much she is edified by seeing me so regular\r\nat mass and at prayers. But little does she imagine the divinity I\r\nadore there.\r\n\r\nThus, in the space of four days, have I given myself up to a violent\r\npassion. You are no stranger to the impetuosity of my desires, and\r\nhow readily all obstacles fly before me: but I’ll tell you what you\r\ndon’t know, that solitude adds immensely to the ardour of desire. I\r\nhave but one idea; I cherish it by day, and dream on’t by night. I\r\nmust possess this woman, lest I should be so ridiculous as to be in\r\nlove; for whither may we not be led by frustrated desire? Oh, delicious\r\nenjoyment! I implore thee for my happiness, and, above all, for my\r\nrepose. How happy it is for us, that the women make so weak a defence!\r\nWere it otherwise, we should be but their cowardly slaves. I feel\r\nmyself at this moment penetrated with gratitude towards complaisant\r\nladies, which, naturally leads me to you, at whose feet I prostrate\r\nmyself to obtain my pardon, and finish this already too long letter.\r\nAdieu, my charming friend!\r\n\r\n_Castle of ——, Aug._ 3, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER V.\r\n\r\n_The_ Marchioness de Merteuil, _to the_ Viscount Valmont.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you know, Viscount, your letter is wonderfully insolent, and has\r\nalmost made me angry? But it plainly proves that you have lost your\r\nreason; and that consideration alone suppresses my indignation. Like a\r\ntender and generous friend, I forget my own injury, and am wholly taken\r\nup with your danger; and irksome as it is to enter into argument, I\r\nyield to the necessity of it at this time.\r\n\r\nYou possess the Presidente Tourvel! What a ridiculous extravagance! I\r\nhere plainly perceive your downright folly, whose nature is to desire\r\nthat you cannot obtain. But let’s examine this woman. She has regular\r\nfeatures, it’s true, but a total want of expression; a tolerable\r\nshape, but without the least elegance; dresses most horridly, with a\r\nbundle of ruffs about her neck, and her stays up to her chin. I tell\r\nyou as a friend, two such women would be quite sufficient to ruin your\r\nreputation. Do you remember the day she collected for the poor at\r\nSt. Roch, when you thank’d me so much for the view of so curious an\r\nexhibition. I think I see her still giving her hand to that great looby\r\nwith the long hair, ready to fall at each step with her calash of four\r\nells over every one’s head, and blushing at every courtesy. Who then\r\nwould have dared to tell you, you will sigh for this woman? For shame,\r\nViscount! Blush yourself, and return to reason. I’ll promise to keep\r\nthis matter secret.\r\n\r\nLet us now examine the disagreeable consequences that await you.\r\nWhat rival have you to encounter? A husband. Don’t you feel yourself\r\nhumiliated at that name? What a shame if you fail! and if you succeed,\r\nwhere is the glory?—I go farther: pleasure is out of the question; for\r\nwho ever had any with a prude? I mean, with a sincere one: reserv’d\r\nin the very bosom of pleasure, they give you but half enjoyments. The\r\nentirely devoting one’s self, that delirium of voluptuousness, where\r\npleasure is refined by excess—all those gifts of love are strangers\r\nto them. I’ll prognosticate for you: suppose your summit of happiness,\r\nyou’ll find your Presidente will think she has done enough in treating\r\nyou as a husband; and, be assured, that in the most tender conjugal\r\ntête-à-tête, the numerical distinction _two_ is always apparent. But\r\nin this case it is much worse; your prude is a devotee, and of that\r\nsort you are in a perpetual state of childhood; perhaps you may get\r\nover this obstacle: but don’t flatter yourself that you’ll annihilate\r\nit. Should you conquer the love of God, you’ll not be able to dispel\r\nthe fear of the devil; and though in holding your charmer in your arms,\r\nyou may feel her heart palpitate, it will be from fear, not love. You\r\nmight, perhaps, had you known this woman sooner, have made something\r\nof her; but she is now two-and-twenty, and has been married almost two\r\nyears. Believe me, Viscount, when a woman is so far incrusted, she\r\nmust be left to her fate; she will never be any thing more than an\r\nundistinguishable individual of a species.\r\n\r\nAnd for such a curious object you refuse to obey me; you bury yourself\r\nin your aunt’s sepulchre; you abandon a most delicious adventure that\r\nis marked out for the advancement of your reputation. By what fatality\r\nis it, that Gercourt must always have the advantage of you?\r\n\r\nI declare I am not out of temper: but at this instant I am inclined to\r\nthink you don’t deserve the reputation you possess; and I consider your\r\nconduct with such a degree of indignation, as tempts me to withdraw my\r\nconfidence from you. No, I never can bring myself to make Madame de\r\nTourvel’s lover the confidant of my secret designs.\r\n\r\nI will tell you, however, that the little Volanges has made a conquest.\r\nYoung Danceny is distracted for her. He has sung with her, and she\r\nreally sings better than belongs to a convent boarder. They have yet\r\nmany duos to rehearse together, and I am much mistaken if she would not\r\nreadily get into unison with him; it is true, Danceny is but a boy\r\nyet, who will waste his time in making love, but never will come to\r\nthe point. Little Volanges is wild enough; but at all events, it will\r\nnever be so pleasing as you could have made it. I am out of temper with\r\nyou, and shall most certainly fall out with the Chevalier when he comes\r\nhome. I would advise him to be mild, for at this time I should feel no\r\ndifficulty to break with him.\r\n\r\nI am certain that if I had sense enough to break off with him now, he\r\nwould be a prey to the most violent despair; yet nothing diverts me\r\nmore than an enraged lover. He, perhaps, would call me perfidious,\r\nand that word has ever pleased me; it is, after the epithet cruel,\r\nthe sweetest to a woman’s ear, and the least painful to deserve. I\r\nwill seriously ruminate on this rupture. You are the cause of all\r\nthis—I shall leave it on your conscience. Adieu! recommend me to your\r\nPresidente in her prayers.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Aug._ 7, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VI.\r\n\r\nViscount de Valmont _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is then no woman that does not abuse the empire she has gained;\r\nand you, whom I have so often called my indulgent friend, are no\r\nlonger so, you are not afraid to attack me even in the very object of\r\nmy affections. What a picture have you drawn of Madame de Tourvel!\r\nWhat man would not have forfeited his life by so daring an act of\r\ninsolence? And what woman but you would not, at least, have determined\r\nme to blast her reputation? For heaven’s sake! never put me to such\r\nrude trials again. I will not be answerable for the consequence. In\r\nthe name of friendship, have patience till I have this woman, if you\r\nmust slander her. Don’t you know, that the time for its causing any\r\nimpression on me will be after I have enjoyed her? But where do I\r\nwander? Does Madame de Tourvel, in order to inspire a passion, need any\r\ndeception? No; to be adorable, ’tis enough she is herself. You find\r\nfault with her dress: you are right; all ornaments are prejudicial\r\nto her; every thing that hides her lovely form is hurtful. It is in\r\nunaffected negligence she is truly ravishing. Thanks to the suffocating\r\nheat of the season, a deshabille of plain lawn adorns her charming,\r\neasy shape. A thin muslin handkerchief covers her bosom; and my\r\nstolen, but penetrating glances, have already seized its enchanting\r\nform. You say her figure has no expression. What should it express,\r\nwhen nothing speaks to her heart? No, indubitably, she has not, like\r\nour coquettes, those false looks, which sometimes seduce, but ever\r\ndeceive. She knows not how to fill up a void of phrase by an affected\r\nsmile; and though she has the finest teeth in the world, she only\r\nlaughs at what pleases her. But she is particularly admirable in the\r\nmost trifling amusements, where she gives the picture of the frankest\r\nand most natural gaiety. In visiting a wretched being that she hastens\r\nto relieve, her looks declare the unsullied joy and compassionate\r\nbounty of her heart. At the most trifling expression of praise or\r\nflattery, the tender embarrassment of unaffected modesty is suffused\r\nover her celestial figure. She is a prude and devotee, and thence you\r\nconclude, she is cold and inanimate. I think quite otherwise. What\r\nastonishing sensibility must she not have, to diffuse it as far as her\r\nhusband, and to love a being always absent! What stronger proof can you\r\nrequire? I found out a method, however, to obtain another; I directed\r\nour walk in such a manner that we had a ditch to leap over, and\r\nalthough very active, she is still more timid—you may very well judge\r\na prude dreads taking a leap. She was obliged to trust herself to me.\r\nI raised this modest woman in my arms. Our preparations, and the skip\r\nof my old aunt, made our sprightly devotee laugh most immoderately:\r\nbut as soon as I seized on her, by a dexterous awkwardness, our arms\r\nwere mutually entwined in each other; I pressed her bosom against mine,\r\nand in this short interval I felt her heart palpitate more quickly; a\r\nlovely blush covered her face, and her modest embarrassment informed me\r\nher heart beat with love and not with fear. My aunt was deceived as you\r\nhad been, and said, “The child is frightened;” but the charming candour\r\nof this child would not permit her to countenance a lie, and she\r\ningenuously answered, “Oh, no; but—” That word alone has cleared up my\r\ndoubts. From this instant, sweet hope has banished cruel inquietude.\r\nI will have this woman. I will take her from a husband who does not\r\ndeserve her. I’ll even snatch her from the god she adores.\r\n\r\nHow delicious to be by turns the object and conqueror of her remorse!\r\nFar be from me the idea of curing her of her prejudices! they will add\r\nto my glory and happiness. Let her rely on her virtue, and sacrifice\r\nit. Let her crime terrify her, without being able to resist its\r\nimpulse; and, alarmed with a thousand terrors, let her neither be able\r\nto forget or conquer them but in my embraces.\r\n\r\nThen I’ll consent to her saying, “I adore thee.” She, of all your sex,\r\nwill be the only one worthy to pronounce that word. Then shall I truly\r\nbe the god of her idolatry. Confess ingenuously to me, that in our\r\narrangements, as indifferent as they are free, what we style happiness\r\nscarce deserves the name of pleasure. I’ll freely acknowledge,\r\nI imagined my heart withered, and incapable only of sensual\r\ngratification; I began to deplore my prematurely advanced age; Madame\r\nde Tourvel has restored me to the illusive charms of youth. With her,\r\nactual enjoyment is not necessary to my happiness. The only thing that\r\nalarms me is the time this adventure will take up; for I am resolved to\r\nrisk nothing. In vain do I bring to remembrance my successful acts of\r\ntemerity on many occasions; I can’t think of attempting them now. To\r\ncrown my bliss, she must give herself up, and that’s not an easy matter\r\nto accomplish.\r\n\r\nI am confident even you must approve my discretion, for as yet I have\r\nnot mentioned the word love; but we are already got as far as those\r\nof friendship and confidence. In order to deceive her as little as\r\npossible, and, above all, to guard against any thing that may come to\r\nher knowledge which might shock her, I have myself related to her,\r\nby way of self-accusation, some of my most remarkable adventures.\r\nYou would be delighted to see how innocently she catechises me. She\r\nsays she is determined to make a convert of me: but has not the least\r\nsuspicion how much the purchase will cost her. She does not think, that\r\nher becoming advocate, to use her own words, _for the many I have\r\nundone_, she is beforehand pleading her own cause.\r\n\r\nThis idea struck me yesterday, in the midst of one of her little\r\nsermons, and I could not resist the pleasure of interrupting her, to\r\ntell her that she spoke like a prophet. Adieu, my lovely friend! you\r\nsee I am not totally lost.\r\n\r\nP. S. But what’s become of our poor Chevalier? Has he destroyed himself\r\nin a fit of despair? Indeed you are a million of times worse than I;\r\nand if I was vain, you’d mortify me to be so much outdone.\r\n\r\n_From the Castle of_ ——,\r\n\r\n_Aug._ 9, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VII.\r\n\r\nCecilia Volanges _to_ Sophia Carnay.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I have not said any thing to you as yet of my marriage, it is\r\nbecause I am as ignorant of the matter as the first day I came home. I\r\nbegin to accustom myself not to think about it, and I am very happy as\r\nI am. I practice my harpsichord and singing much; and I am fonder of\r\nthem than when I had a master, or rather now I have got a better one.\r\nThe Chevalier Danceny, the gentleman I mentioned to you before, with\r\nwhom I sang at Madame Merteuil’s, is so obliging to come every day to\r\nsing with me for hours together. He is exceedingly agreeable. He sings\r\nlike an angel, and sets the words of his own composition to very pretty\r\nmusic. It is a great pity he is a Knight of Malta! I think, were he to\r\nembark in wedlock, his wife would be very happy. He is the sweetest\r\ncreature breathing. Without the affectation of complaisance, every\r\nthing he does is endearing. He always chides me about music, or some\r\nother trifle; but he blends with his censures so much concern and good\r\nnature, that one can’t help being pleased. His very looks seem to speak\r\nobliging things. And with all this, he is the most complaisant man\r\npossible: for instance; yesterday he was asked to a private concert,\r\nbut spent the evening at Mamma’s, which gratified me exceedingly; for,\r\nwhen he is absent, I have no one to speak to, and am quite stupid:\r\nbut, when he is with us, we chat and sing together, and he always has\r\nsomething to say to me. Madame de Merteuil and he are the only two\r\namiable persons I yet know. Adieu, my dear friend! I promised to be\r\nperfect to-day in a little air, with a very difficult accompaniment,\r\nand I must keep my word. I must set about practising it against his\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\n_From ——, Aug._ 7, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Not to tire the reader’s patience, we suppress many of the letters\r\nof this daily correspondence, and give only them we think necessary for\r\nunfolding the events of this society. For the same reason we suppress\r\nall those of Sophia Carnay, and several of those of the actors in this\r\npiece.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VIII.\r\n\r\nPresidente de Tourvel _to_ Madame de Volanges.\r\n\r\n\r\nPermit me, Madam, to assure you, no one can be more sensible of\r\nthe confidence you repose in me, nor have more at heart the happy\r\nestablishment of Mademoiselle de Volanges than I have. With my whole\r\nsoul I wish her that felicity which I am confident she merits, and\r\nwhich I have no doubt she will obtain through your prudence. I have not\r\nthe honour of knowing Count Gercourt, but conceive the most favourable\r\nopinion of him, as he is your choice. I limit my good wishes to the\r\nhope that this match may be as happy as mine, which was also one of\r\nyour making, and which gratitude daily calls to my remembrance. May\r\nthe happiness of Mademoiselle de Volanges be the reward of that I\r\nenjoy, and may the best of friends be also the happiest of mothers!\r\n\r\nI am really mortified that I am not at present able, personally, to\r\nassure you of the grateful sentiments of my heart, and to accomplish\r\nwhat I wish for much, an acquaintance with Mademoiselle de Volanges.\r\n\r\nAfter having experienced your maternal fondness, I think I am entitled\r\nto the tender friendship of a sister from her. I entreat you, Madam, to\r\nclaim it for me, until I have it in my power to deserve it. I propose\r\nresiding in the country during Mr. de Tourvel’s absence. I now enjoy\r\nand improve in the respectable company of Madame Rosemonde. This lady\r\nis ever delightful; her great age has not the least impaired her\r\ngaiety or memory; her body may be eighty-four, but her understanding\r\nis only twenty. Our retirement is enlivened by the Viscount Valmont,\r\nher nephew, who has condescended to spend a few days with us. I only\r\nknew him by character, which gave me an unfavourable opinion of him,\r\nthat now I don’t think he deserves. Here, where the bustle of the\r\nworld does not affect him, he is very agreeable, and owns his failings\r\nwith great candour. He converses with me very confidentially, and I\r\nsometimes sermonize him with asperity; you, who know him well, will, I\r\ndare say, think such a conversion worth attempting: but I am afraid,\r\nnotwithstanding all his promises, eight days in Paris will destroy all\r\nmy labours; however, his residence here will be so much gained from his\r\ngeneral course of life, and I am clear, that the best thing he can do\r\nwill be to remain in inactivity. He knows that I am now writing to you,\r\nand begs leave to present his most respectful compliments. I beg you’ll\r\nalso accept mine with that condescension you have ever had for me, and\r\nbe assured of the sincerity of the sentiments with which I have the\r\nhonour to be, &c.\r\n\r\n_From the Castle of_ ——,\r\n_Aug._ 9, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER IX.\r\n\r\nMadame de Volanges _to the_ Presidente de Tourvel.\r\n\r\n\r\nI never yet doubted, my young and charming friend, of your friendship\r\nfor me, nor of the interest you take in all my concerns. It is not to\r\nclear up this point, on which I hope we are for ever agreed, that I\r\nreply to your answer; but I think myself obliged to say a word or two\r\nrelative to Viscount Valmont.\r\n\r\nI must own, I did not expect to meet such a name in a letter from\r\nyou. How is it possible there can be any communication between you\r\nand him? You do not know that man. Where did you find the idea you\r\nhave imbibed of the heart of a libertine? You tell me of his uncommon\r\ncandour; yes, truly, Valmont’s candour is very uncommon. He is yet more\r\nfalse and dangerous than he is lovely and seducing: never since his\r\nearliest youth, has he taken a step, or spoke a word, without a design;\r\nand never formed a design that was not criminal or improper. My dear\r\nfriend, you know me; you know that of all the virtues I endeavour\r\nto acquire, indulgence is the one I cherish most; and if Valmont had\r\nbeen hurried away by the impetuosity of his passions, or if, like a\r\nthousand more at his time of life, he had been seduced by the errors\r\nof youth, I would have compassionated his person, blamed his conduct,\r\nand have patiently waited until time, the happy maturer of green years,\r\nshould have made him fit for the society and esteem of worthy people:\r\nbut that’s not Valmont’s case; his conduct is the result of principle;\r\nhe calculates how far a man can proceed in villainy without risking\r\nreputation, and has chosen women for his victims, that his sacrifices\r\nmay be wicked and cruel without danger. I shall not dwell on the\r\nnumbers he has seduced; but how many has he not utterly undone? Those\r\nscandalous anecdotes never come within the sphere of your retired and\r\nregular course of life. I could, however, relate you some that would\r\nmake you shudder; but your mind, pure as your soul, would be defiled\r\nwith such descriptions: convinced, as I am, that Valmont will never be\r\nan object of danger to you, such armour is unnecessary to guard you. I\r\ncan’t, however, refrain telling you, that successful or not, no woman\r\nhe ever yet dangled after, but had reason to repent her folly. The\r\nonly exception to this general rule is the Marchioness de Merteuil;\r\nshe alone has been capable not only of resisting, but of completely\r\ndefeating his wickedness.\r\n\r\nI must acknowledge, this trait in her character strikes me the most\r\nforcibly; and has amply justified her to the world for some trifling\r\nindiscretions in the outset of her widowhood.[1] However, my charming\r\nfriend, authorised as I am, by age, experience, and much more by\r\nfriendship, I am obliged to inform you, the world take notice of\r\nValmont’s absence; and that if they come to know that he has for any\r\ntime formed a trio with you and his aunt, your reputation will be\r\nat his mercy, which is the greatest misfortune that can happen to a\r\nwoman. I therefore advise you to prevail on his aunt not to detain\r\nhim longer; and if he should still determine to remain, I think you\r\nshould not hesitate a moment on quitting the place. But why should he\r\nremain? How does he employ himself in the country? I am certain, if his\r\nmotions were watched, you would discover that he has only taken up his\r\nresidence in that commodious retreat for the accomplishment of some act\r\nof villainy he meditates in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nWhen it is not in our power to prevent an evil, let us at least take\r\ncare to preserve ourselves from its consequences. Adieu! my lovely\r\nfriend. An accident retards my daughter’s marriage for some little\r\ntime. Count Gercourt, whom we daily expected, informs me his regiment\r\nis ordered for Corsica; and as the military operations are not yet\r\nover, it will be impossible for him to return before winter: this\r\ndisconcerts me; however, it gives me hope we shall have your company at\r\nthe wedding; and I was vexed it should take place without you. Adieu! I\r\nam as free from compliment as reserve, entirely yours.\r\n\r\nP. S. Bring me back to the recollection of Madame de Rosemonde, whom I\r\nshall always love for her great merit.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Madame de Volanges’ error informs us, that Valmont, like most\r\nprofligate wretches, did not impeach his accomplices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER X.\r\n\r\n_The_ Marchioness de Merteuil, _to_ Viscount Valmont.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre you out of temper with me, Viscount, or are you dead, or, which is\r\npretty much the same, do you live no longer but for your Presidente?\r\nThis woman, who has restored you to the _illusive charms of youth_,\r\nwill also soon restore you to its ridiculous follies. You are already\r\na timid slave; you may as well be in love at once. You renounce your\r\n_happy acts of temerity on many occasions;_ and thus, without any\r\nprinciple to direct you, give yourself up to caprice, or rather chance.\r\nDo you know, that love is like physic, _only the art of assisting\r\nnature?_ You see I fight you on your own ground, but it shall not\r\nexcite any vanity in me; for there is no great honour in engaging a\r\nvanquished enemy. _She must give herself up_, you tell me; without\r\ndoubt she must, and will, as others, but with this difference, that\r\nshe’ll do it awkwardly. But that it may terminate in her giving herself\r\nup, the true method is to begin by taking her. What a ridiculous\r\ndistinction, what nonsense in a love matter; I say love; for you\r\nreally are in love. To speak otherwise would be deceiving you, would\r\nbe concealing your disorder from you. Tell me, then, my dear sighing\r\nswain, of the different women you have had, do you think you gained any\r\nof them by force? Whatever inclination we may have to yield, however\r\nwe feel our compliance unavoidable, still must there be a pretence;\r\nand can there be a more commodious one for us, than that which gives\r\nus the appearance of being overcome by force? For my part, I own\r\nnothing charms me to much as a brisk lively attack, where every thing\r\nis carried on with regularity, but with rapidity; which never puts us\r\nto the painful dilemma of being ourselves constrained to remedy an\r\nawkwardness which, on the contrary, we should convert to our advantage;\r\nand which keeps up the appearance of violence, even when we yield,\r\nand dexterously flatters our two favourite passions, the glory of a\r\ndefence, and the pleasure of a defeat. I must own that this talent,\r\nwhich is more uncommon than one would imagine, always pleased me, even\r\nwhen it did not guide me, and that it has sometimes happened that I\r\nhave only surrendered from gratitude: thus, in our tournaments of old,\r\nbeauty gave the prize to valour and address.\r\n\r\nBut you, you who are no longer yourself, you proceed as if you dreaded\r\nsuccess. And pray how long is it since you have fallen into the method\r\nof travelling so gently, and in such bye-roads? Believe me, when one\r\nhas a mind to arrive, post-horses and the high road is the only method.\r\n\r\nBut let us drop this subject; it the more puts me out of temper, as it\r\ndeprives me of the pleasure of seeing you. At least, write me oftener\r\nthan you do, and acquaint me with your progress. You seem to forget\r\nthat this ridiculous piece of business has already taken up a fortnight\r\nof your time, and that you neglect every body.\r\n\r\nNow I mention neglect, you resemble those who send regularly to inquire\r\nof the state of health of their sick friends, and who never concern\r\nthemselves about the answer. You finish your last letter by asking\r\nwhether the Chevalier is dead. I make no reply, and you are no farther\r\nconcerned about the matter; have you forgot my lover is your sworn\r\nfriend? But comfort yourself; he is not dead; or if he was, it would be\r\nfrom excess of pleasure. This poor Chevalier, how tender! How formed\r\nfor love! How sensibly he affects one! He distracts me. Seriously,\r\nthen, his happiness in being loved by me, inspires me with a true\r\naffection for him.\r\n\r\nThe very day I wrote you that I was taken up in contriving our\r\nrupture, how happy did I not make him! And yet I was in earnest\r\nengaged how I should make him desperate when he appeared. Whether\r\nwhim or inclination, he never appeared to so much advantage. However,\r\nI received him coolly; he expected to spend a couple of hours with\r\nme before my time of seeing company. I told him I was going abroad,\r\nhe begg’d to know where; I refused to tell him. He insisted to know;\r\n_where you will not be,_ I replied with some tartness. Happily for\r\nhim he was petrified at my answer; for had he pronounced a syllable,\r\na scene would have ensued which would infallibly have brought on the\r\nintended rupture. Astonished at his silence, I cast a look at him,\r\nwith no other design, I swear, but to observe his countenance; I was\r\ninstantly struck with the deep and tender sadness that covered this\r\ncharming figure, which you have owned it is so difficult to resist.\r\nThe same cause produced the same effect; I was a second time overcome;\r\nfrom that instant I endeavoured to prevent his having any reason to\r\ncomplain. I am going out on business, said I, in a milder tone, and\r\nthe business relates to you; ask no more questions. I shall sup at\r\nhome; at your return you’ll know all: he then recovered his speech; but\r\nI would not suffer him to go on. I’m in great haste, continued I. Leave\r\nme until night. He kissed my hand and departed. In order to make him,\r\nor perhaps myself, amends, I immediately resolved to show him my villa,\r\nof which he had not the least suspicion; I called my faithful maid,\r\nVictoire. I am seized with my dizziness, said I; let all my servants\r\nknow I am gone to bed; when alone, I desired her to put on a footman’s\r\ndress, and metamorphosed myself into a chamber-maid.\r\n\r\nShe ordered a hackney-coach to my garden-door, and we instantly set\r\nout; Being arrived at this temple dedicated to love, I put on my\r\ngenteelest deshabille; a most delicious one, and of my own invention:\r\nit leaves nothing exposed, but every thing for fancy to imagine.\r\nI promise you the pattern for your Presidente, when you shall have\r\nrendered her worthy of wearing it.\r\n\r\nAfter those preparations, whilst Victoire was taken up with other\r\nmatters, I read a chapter of the Sopha, a letter of the New Eloisa,\r\nand two of La Fontaine’s Tales, to rehearse the different characters I\r\nintended to assume. In the mean time, my Chevalier came to my house,\r\nwith his usual eagerness. My porter refused him admittance, and\r\ninforming him I was indisposed, delivered him a note from me, but not\r\nof my writing; according to my usual discretion. He opens, and finds in\r\nVictoire’s writing;—“At nine precisely, at the Boulevard, opposite the\r\ncoffee-houses.”\r\n\r\nThither he proceeds, and a little footman whom he does not know, or at\r\nleast thinks he does not know, for it was Victoire, tells him he must\r\nsend back his carriage and follow him. All this romantic proceeding\r\nheated his imagination, and on such occasions a heated imagination is\r\nuseful. At last he arrives, and love and astonishment produced in him\r\nthe effect of a real enchantment. In order to give him time to recover\r\nfrom his surprise, we walked a while in the grove; I then brought\r\nhim back to the house. The first thing which presented itself to his\r\nview, was a table with two covers, and a bed prepared. From thence we\r\nwent into the cabinet, which was most elegantly decorated. There, in\r\nsuspense, between reflection and sentiment, I flung my arms around\r\nhim, and letting myself fall at his knees—“Alas! my dear friend,”\r\nsaid I, “what reproaches do I not deserve, for having, for a moment,\r\ngiven you uneasiness by an affected ill-humour, in order to enhance\r\nthe pleasure and surprise of this moment, for having concealed my heart\r\nfrom your tenderness! Forgive me; I will expiate my crime with the most\r\nardent love.” You may guess what was the effect of this sentimental\r\ndeclaration. The happy Chevalier raised me, and my pardon was sealed on\r\nthe same sopha where you and I, in a similar way, so cheerfully sealed\r\nour eternal rupture.\r\n\r\nAs we had six hours to pass together, and that I was determined\r\nthe whole time should be devoted to delight him, I moderated his\r\ntransports, and called lovely coquetry to the aid of tenderness. I\r\ndon’t know I ever took so much pains to please, or ever, in my own\r\nopinion, succeeded so well. After supper, by turns, childish and\r\nrational, wanton and tender, sometimes even libertine. I took pleasure\r\nin considering him as a Sultan, in the midst of his Seraglio, to whom\r\nI alternately supplied the places of different favourites; and indeed,\r\nhis reiterated offerings, though always received by the same woman,\r\nwere received as by a new mistress.\r\n\r\nAt length, when day appeared, it was necessary to part; and\r\nnotwithstanding all he said, and even what he did, to prove the\r\ncontrary, there was, on his part, as much necessity for it, as want of\r\ninclination. At the instant of parting, for a last adieu, I delivered\r\nhim the key of this happy mansion: I had it for you alone, said I, and\r\nit is fit you should be the master of it; it is but right the high\r\npriest should dispose of the temple. By this artifice, I anticipated\r\nany reflections which might arise in his mind relative to the propriety\r\nof a villa, which is ever matter of suspicion. I know him so well,\r\nthat I’m certain he will never make use on’t but for me; and if I\r\nshould have a fancy to go there without him, I have another key. He by\r\nall means would make an appointment for another day; but I as yet love\r\nhim too much, to wear him out soon; the true maxim is, not give into\r\nexcess, but with those one wishes to be rid of. This he is a stranger\r\nto; but, happily for him, I know it for us both.\r\n\r\nI perceive it is now three in the morning, and that I have wrote a\r\nvolume, though I intended but a short letter. Such are the charms\r\nof confidential friendship; it is that confidential friendship that\r\nrenders you the object I love most; but indeed the Chevalier is the\r\nobject that pleases me most.\r\n\r\n_From ——, Aug._ 12, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XI.\r\n\r\n_The_ Presidente de Tourvel _to_ Madame Volanges.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe severity of your letter would have terrified me strangely, dear\r\nmadam, if I had not here stronger reasons to think myself perfectly\r\nsafe, than those you give me for apprehension. The formidable Mr.\r\nde Valmont, the terror of our sex, seems to have laid aside his\r\nmurderous arms, before he entered this castle. Far from having formed\r\nany design, he did not even appear to have brought any claims; and\r\nthe accomplishments of an amiable man, which his enemies even give\r\nto him, almost vanish to give place to the character of good-natured\r\ncreature. Probably it is the country air has wrought this miracle;\r\none thing I can assure you, tho’ incessantly with me, even seemingly\r\npleased with my company, not a word that has the least tendency to love\r\nhas escaped him, not even one of those phrases that most men assume,\r\nwithout having, like him, any thing to plead in their justification.\r\nNever does he put one under the necessity of flying for shelter to\r\nthat reservedness to which a woman, who will maintain her dignity, is\r\nobliged to have recourse now-a-days, to keep the men within bounds. He\r\ndoes not abuse the gaiety he inspires. Perhaps he flatters a little too\r\nmuch; but it is with so much delicacy, that he would reconcile even\r\nmodesty to praise. To conclude, had I a brother, I would wish him to be\r\nwhat Mr. de Valmont is here. There are many women, perhaps, would wish\r\nhim to have a more _pointed_ gallantry; and I own I am greatly obliged\r\nto him for the good opinion he entertains, by not confounding me with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThis description undoubtedly differs very much from that you have given\r\nme; and yet they may both carry a resemblance, if we ascertain our\r\ntimes. He himself agrees he has done many wrong things, and, perhaps,\r\nthe world has imputed many more to him. But I have seldom met with men\r\nwho spoke more respectfully of women of character, almost to enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nIn this point, at least, you inform me he is not a deceiver. I rest\r\nthe proof on his conduct to Madame de Merteuil. He often speaks of\r\nher; and always so much in her praise, and with the appearance of so\r\nmuch affection, that I imagined, until I received your letter, that\r\nwhat he had called friendship was really love. I condemn myself for\r\nmy rash opinion, in which I am the more blameable, as he himself has\r\nfrequently spoke in her justification; and I own his honest sincerity\r\nI looked on as artifice. I don’t know, but it appears to me, that the\r\nman who is capable of so constant a friendship for a deserving woman,\r\ncannot be an abandoned libertine; but whether we are to attribute\r\nhis prudent conduct here to any scheme in this neighbourhood, as you\r\nsuppose, is a question. There are some few agreeable women around us;\r\nhowever, he seldom goes abroad except in the morning, and then he says\r\nhe goes a shooting; he seldom brings home any game, it is true, but he\r\ntells us he is a bad shot. However, what he does out of doors, concerns\r\nme but little; and if I wished to be informed, it would be only to have\r\none more reason to come into your opinion, or to bring you over to mine.\r\n\r\nAs to what you propose, that I should endeavour to shorten the time\r\nof Mr. de Valmont’s residence here, it appears to me a matter of\r\nsome difficulty, to desire an aunt not to have her nephew with her;\r\nand a nephew for whom she has the greatest affection. However, I\r\npromise you, through deference only, and not that I see any necessity\r\nfor it, to take the first opportunity to make this request either\r\nto him or her. As to myself, Mr. de Tourvel is acquainted with my\r\nintention of remaining here until his return, and he would, with\r\nreason, be astonished at my levity. Thus, Madam, I have given you a\r\nlong explanation; but I thought a justification of Mr. de Valmont to\r\nyou, where it appears very necessary, a debt to truth. I am not the\r\nless sensible of the friendship which suggested your advice. I am also\r\nindebted to it for the obliging manner in which you acquaint me of the\r\ndelay of Madame de Volanges’ nuptials, for which accept my most sincere\r\nthanks; but whatever pleasure I might expect on that occasion in your\r\ncompany, would be willingly sacrificed to the satisfaction of knowing\r\nMademoiselle de Volanges’ happiness sooner completed, if, after all,\r\nshe can be more so than with a mother, every way deserving her respect\r\nand tenderness. I partake with her those sentiments which attach me\r\nto you, and beg you’ll receive this assurance of them with your usual\r\ngoodness.\r\n\r\nI have the honour to be, &c.\r\n\r\n_From ——, Aug._ 13, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XII.\r\n\r\nCecilia Volanges _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nMadam,\r\n\r\nMy Mamma is indisposed; she will not go out to-day, and I must keep her\r\ncompany: thus I am deprived the honour of attending you to the opera. I\r\nassure you I regret more the loss of your company than the performance.\r\nI hope you are persuaded of this, for I have a great affection for\r\nyou. Be so good to tell the Chevalier Danceny, I have not yet got the\r\ncollection which he mentioned, and that if he can bring it himself\r\nto-morrow, I shall be obliged to him. If he comes to-day, he will be\r\ntold we are not at home; but the reason is, Mamma sees no company. I\r\nhope she will be better to-morrow.\r\n\r\nI have the honour, &c.\r\n\r\n_From ——, Aug._ 13, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XIII.\r\n\r\n_The_ Marchioness de Merteuil _to_ Cecilia Volanges.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am much concerned, my charming girl, to be deprived of the pleasure\r\nof seeing you, as well as for the cause; I hope we shall find another\r\nopportunity. I performed your commission with the Chevalier Danceny,\r\nwho will certainly be very sorry to hear of your Mamma’s indisposition;\r\nif she’ll admit me to-morrow, I’ll wait on her. She and I will attack\r\nthe Chevalier de Belleroche at piquet[1]; and in winning his money,\r\nwe shall have the double pleasure of hearing you sing with your\r\namiable master, to whom I shall propose it. If it be agreeable to your\r\nMamma and you, I will answer for my two Knights and myself. Adieu, my\r\nlovely girl! My compliments to Madame de Volanges. I embrace you most\r\naffectionately.\r\n\r\n_From ——, Aug._ 13, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] This is the same who is mentioned in Madame de Merteuil’s letters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XIV.\r\n\r\nCecilia Volanges _to_ Sophia Carnay.\r\n\r\n\r\nI did not write to you yesterday, my dear Sophy; but I assure you it\r\nwas not pleasure that prevented me. My Mamma was indisposed, and I did\r\nnot quit her the whole day. At night, when I retired, I had not spirits\r\nto do any thing; and I went to bed very early, in order to terminate\r\nthe day: never did I pass so long a one. It is not but I love Mamma\r\nvery much; but I don’t know how it was. I was to have gone to the opera\r\nwith Madame de Merteuil; the Chevalier Danceny was to have been there.\r\nYou know they are the two I love most. When the hour of the opera\r\narrived, my heart was oppressed in spite of me; every thing displeased\r\nme, and I wept involuntarily. Fortunately Mamma was in bed, and could\r\nnot see me. I am sure Chevalier Danceny must have been chagrined as\r\nwell as I; but the company and performance must have amused him: I am\r\nvery differently situated. But Mamma is better to-day, and Madame de\r\nMerteuil, Chevalier Danceny, and another gentleman, will be with us.\r\nMadame de Merteuil comes late, and it’s very tiresome to be so long\r\nalone. It is only eleven, yet I must practise my harpsichord, it is\r\ntrue; and then my toilet will take me up some time, for I will have\r\nmy head well dressed to-day. I really believe our mother Abbess was\r\nright, that one becomes a coquet on entering into life. I never had so\r\nstrong a desire to be handsome, as for some days past, and I think I am\r\nnot so handsome as I thought; in women’s company that paint, one looks\r\nmuch worse; for example, all the men think Madame de Merteuil handsomer\r\nthan me; that does not vex me much, because she loves me: and then\r\nshe assures me the Chevalier Danceny thinks me handsomer than her. It\r\nis very good natured of her to tell me so; she even seemed to be glad\r\nof it. Now I don’t conceive how that can be. It is because she loves\r\nme so much! And he too! Oh that gives me infinite pleasure! I really\r\nthink, barely looking at him makes me appear handsome. I would always\r\nbe looking at him, if I was not afraid of meeting his eyes: for as\r\noften as that happens, it disconcerts me, and gives me uneasiness; but\r\nthat signifies nothing. Adieu, my dear Sophy! I am going to dress.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Aug._ 14, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XV.\r\n\r\nViscount Valmont _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nIndeed you are very kind not to abandon me to my melancholy fate: the\r\nlife I lead here is really fatiguing, from excess of repose and insipid\r\nuniformity. Reading your letter with the particulars of your delightful\r\nexcursion, I was tempted twenty times to pretend business, fly to your\r\nfeet, and beg of you to commit, in my favour, an infidelity to your\r\nChevalier, who really does not deserve his bliss. Do you know you have\r\nroused my jealousy? Why tell me of an eternal rupture? I recant an oath\r\ntaken in a fit of frenzy. We should not have been entitled to so solemn\r\na privilege, had we seriously intended to keep it. Ah, may I be one day\r\nrevenged in your embraces, for the vexation the Chevalier’s happiness\r\ngives me! I am all indignation I own, to think that a man who has\r\nscarce common sense, without taking the least trouble, and only simply\r\nfollowing the instinct of his heart, should find a happiness I can’t\r\nattain. Oh, I will disturb him: promise me I shall disturb him! But\r\nhave you not humiliated yourself? You take the trouble to deceive him,\r\nand he is happier than you. You think you have him in your toils, but\r\nyou are in his. He sleeps quietly, whilst you wake for his pleasures.\r\nWhat could his slaves do more?\r\n\r\nHark ye, my lovely friend, while you divide yourself among many, I\r\nam not in the least jealous; I then look down on your lovers as on\r\nAlexander’s successors; incapable of preserving among them that empire\r\nwhere I reigned sole monarch; but that you should give yourself up\r\nentirely to one of them, that another should exist as happy as me,\r\nI will not suffer; don’t expect I’ll bear it! Either take me again,\r\nor take another; and do not, by any exclusive caprice, betray the\r\ninviolable friendship we have sworn to each other.\r\n\r\nIs it not curious, that I should have reason to complain of love? You\r\nsee I give into your ideas, and confess my errors. If not to be able\r\nto exist without the possession of what we desire, if to sacrifice\r\ntime, pleasure, and life for it, then am I really in love; and I have\r\nmade no progress. I should not even have a word to say to you on the\r\nsubject, but for an accident that racks my imagination, and leaves me\r\nin suspense between hope and fear.\r\n\r\nYou know my huntsman; a treasure of intrigue, and a true valet as ever\r\ndramatic pen drew. You may conceive he had it in his instructions to be\r\nin love with the waiting-maid, and make the servants drunk.\r\n\r\nThe rascal is happier than his master; he has already succeeded; and\r\nhas just discovered that Madame de Tourvel has appointed one of her\r\npeople to observe me, and even to follow me in my morning excursions,\r\nas much as possible, without being perceived.\r\n\r\nWhat does this woman mean? Thus, then, the most virtuous of them will\r\nventure to do things, that one of us would not dare think on! Well, I\r\nswear—but before I think of being revenged for this female artifice, I\r\nwill endeavour to convert it to my advantage. Hitherto those suspected\r\nexcursions had no view; I must give them one. This deserves my utmost\r\nattention, and I quit you to reflect on it. Adieu, my charming friend!\r\n\r\n_Always from the Castle of_ ——,\r\n_Aug._ 15, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XVI.\r\n\r\nCecilia Volanges _to_ Sophia Carnay.\r\n\r\n\r\nAh, Sophia, I have a deal of news! But may be I should not tell you:\r\nI must tell it, however, to somebody, I can’t keep it. Chevalier\r\nDanceny—I’m in such trouble, I can’t write; I don’t know where to\r\nbegin. Since the agreeable evening that I related to you I spent at\r\nMamma’s[1], with him and Madame de Merteuil, I said no more of him:\r\nthat was because I resolved not to say any more of him to any one;\r\nbut I was always thinking of him notwithstanding. Since that, he is\r\nbecome so melancholy, that it makes me uneasy; and when I asked him the\r\nreason, he answered me he was not so, but I could plainly see he was.\r\nHe was yesterday more so than usual; that did not, however, prevent him\r\nfrom singing with his usual complaisance; but every time he looked at\r\nme, my heart was ready to break. After we had done singing, he locked\r\nup my harpsichord; and bringing me the key, begged I would play again\r\nin the evening when I was alone. I had no suspicion of any thing; I\r\neven refused him: but he insisted so much, that I promised I would.\r\nHe had his reasons for it. When I retired to my room, and my maid\r\nwas gone, I went to my harpsichord. I found hid among the strings an\r\nunsealed letter from him. Ah, if you did but know all he writes! Since\r\nI read his letter, I am in such raptures I can think of nothing else.\r\nI read it over four times running, and then locked it in my desk. I\r\ngot it by heart; and when I laid down I repeated it so often, I could\r\nnot think of sleeping; as soon as I shut my eyes, I thought I saw him,\r\ntelling me every thing I had just read. I did not sleep till very late;\r\nand, as soon as I awoke, (though it was very early,) I got up for the\r\nletter, to read it at my leisure; I took it into bed, and began to kiss\r\nit; as if——but may be I did wrong to kiss a letter thus, but I could\r\nnot help it.\r\n\r\nNow, my dear friend, if I am very well pleased, I am also very much\r\ntroubled; for certainly I must not answer it. I know that must not be,\r\nand yet he urges it; and if I don’t answer it, I am certain he will\r\nbe again melancholy. It is a great pity; what would you advise me\r\nto? But you know no more than I. I have a great mind to tell Madame\r\nde Merteuil, who has a great affection for me. I wish I could console\r\nhim; but I would not do any thing wrong. We are taught good-nature, and\r\nyet we are forbid to follow its dictates, when a man is in question.\r\nThat I can’t understand. Is not a man our neighbour as well as a woman,\r\nand still more so? For have we not a father as well as a mother, a\r\nbrother as well as a sister, and there is the husband besides? Yet if\r\nI was to do any thing that was not right, perhaps Mr. Danceny himself\r\nwould no longer have a good opinion of me! Oh, then I would rather he\r\nshould be melancholy! And I shall still be time enough; though he wrote\r\nyesterday, I am not obliged to write to-day; and I shall see Madame de\r\nMerteuil this evening, and if I can have so much resolution, I will\r\ntell her all. Following her advice, I shall have nothing to reproach\r\nmyself; and may be she may tell me I may give him a few words of\r\nanswer, that he may not be melancholy. I’m in great uneasiness! Adieu!\r\nBe sure tell me what you think I ought to do.\r\n\r\n_Aug._ 13, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The letter that is mentioned here was not found; but there is\r\nreason to believe that it is that Madame de Merteuil mentions in her\r\nletter which Cecilia Volanges refers to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XVII.\r\n\r\n_The Chevalier_ Danceny _to_ Cecilia Volanges.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore I give way, Miss, whether shall I call it, to the pleasure or\r\nnecessity of writing to you, I begin by entreating you to hear me: I am\r\nsensible I stand in need of your indulgence, in daring to declare my\r\nsentiments for you; if they wanted only vindication, indulgence would\r\nbe useless. Yet, after all, what am I about to do, but exhibit your\r\nown productions? I have nothing to say that my looks, my confusion, my\r\nconduct, and even my silence, have not already told you! Why should\r\nyou be displeased with sentiments to which you have given birth?\r\nProceeding from you, they certainly should be offered you; if they are\r\nas inflamed as my heart, they are as chaste as your own. Where is the\r\ncrime to have discovered how to set a proper value on your charms, your\r\nbewitching qualifications, your enchanting graces, and that affecting\r\ningenuousness which so much enhances such valuable accomplishments? No;\r\nundoubtedly there is not: but one may be unhappy, without being guilty,\r\nwhich must be my fate, should you refuse to accept a homage, the first\r\nmy heart ever made. Were it not for you, I should still have been, if\r\nnot happy, yet undisturbed. I saw you, and tranquillity fled my soul,\r\nand left my happiness uncertain!\r\n\r\nAnd yet you seem to wonder at my grief, and demand the cause; I have\r\neven sometimes thought it gave you uneasiness. Ah, speak but the word,\r\nand my felicity will be complete! But before you pronounce it, remember\r\nit may also overwhelm me in misery. Be the arbitress of my fate, you\r\ncan make me happy or miserable for ever; into what dearer hands can\r\nI commit such a trust? I shall finish as I began, by imploring your\r\nindulgence; I have entreated you to hear me; I shall farther presume to\r\nbeg an answer. If refused, I shall think you are offended; though my\r\nheart is witness, my respect equals my love.\r\n\r\nP. S. If you indulge me with an answer, you can convey it in the\r\nsame way through which manner you receive this: it is both safe and\r\ncommodious.\r\n\r\n_Aug._ 18, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nCecilia Volanges _to_ Sophia Carnay.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat, my Sophia, you blame beforehand the step I intend to take! I had\r\nuneasiness enough already, but you add considerably to it. You say,\r\nI certainly ought not to answer his letter; you are quite, at your\r\nease, and can give advice; but you know not how I am circumstanced,\r\nand are not able, not being on the spot, to give an opinion. Sure I\r\nam, were you so situated, you would act as I do. Certainly, according\r\nto etiquette, I should not answer his letter; and by my letter of\r\nyesterday, you may perceive my intention was not to reply; but I don’t\r\nthink any one was ever so circumstanced as I am.\r\n\r\nAnd, then, to be left to my own discretion! For Madame de Merteuil,\r\nwhom I depended on seeing in the evening, did not come. Every thing\r\nis against me; she is the cause of my knowing him. In her company, it\r\nhas almost always been, that I have seen and spoke to him. It is not\r\nthat I have any ill-will towards her for it—but I’m left to myself\r\nwhen I want her advice most. Well, I’m greatly to be pitied! Only\r\nthink, yesterday he came as usual. I was so confused I could not look\r\nat him; he could not speak to me, for Mamma was with us. I knew he\r\nwould be vexed when he found I had not wrote to him; I did not know\r\nhow to appear. He immediately asked me if I had a mind he should bring\r\nmy harpsichord. My heart beat so I could scarcely say yes. When he\r\nreturned it was much worse. I just glanced at him. He did not see me,\r\nbut looked as if he was ill; that made me very unhappy. He tuned my\r\nharpsichord, and said, with a sigh, Ah, Miss! He spoke but those two\r\nwords; and in such a tone as threw me into the greatest confusion. I\r\nstruck a few chords without knowing what I did: Mamma asked him to\r\nsing; he excused himself, saying, he was not well; but I had no excuse,\r\nand was forced to sing. I then wished I had no voice; and chose, on\r\npurpose, a song that I did not know; for I was certain I could not sing\r\nany one, and some notice would have been taken.\r\n\r\nFortunately a visitor came; and as soon as I heard a coach coming, I\r\nstopped, and begged he would put up my harpsichord. I was much afraid\r\nhe would then go away, but he returned. Whilst Mamma and the lady, who\r\ncame, were chatting together, I wished to look at him for a moment; I\r\nmet his eyes, and I could not turn mine from him. That instant I saw\r\nhis tears flow, and he was obliged to turn his head aside to hide them.\r\nI found I could not withstand it; and that I was also ready to weep. I\r\nretired, and instantly wrote with a pencil on a slip of paper, “I beg\r\nyou’ll not be so dejected; I promise to answer your letter.”—Surely\r\nyou can’t say there was any harm in this; I could not help it. I put\r\nmy note in the strings of my harpsichord, as his was, and returned to\r\nthe saloon. I found myself much easier, and was impatient until the\r\nlady went away. She was on her visits, and soon retired. As soon as\r\nshe was gone, I said I would again play on my harpsichord, and begged\r\nhe would bring it. I saw by his looks he suspected nothing; but when he\r\nreturned, oh, he was so pleased! In laying the instrument before me, he\r\nplaced himself in such a manner that Mamma could not see, and squeezed\r\nmy hand—but it was but for a moment: I can’t express the pleasure I\r\nreceived; I drew it away however; so that I have nothing to reproach\r\nmyself with.\r\n\r\nNow, my dear friend, you see I can’t avoid writing to him, since I have\r\npromised; and I will not chagrin him any more I am determined; for I\r\nsuffer more than he does. Certainly, as to any thing bad, I would not\r\nbe guilty of it, but what harm can there be in writing, when it is to\r\nprevent one from being unhappy? What puzzles me is, that I shall not\r\nknow what to say; but that signifies nothing; and I am certain its\r\ncoming from me will be quite sufficient.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear friend! If you think me wrong, tell me; but I don’t\r\nbelieve I am. As the time draws near to write to him, my heart beats\r\nstrangely; however, it must be so, as I have promised it.\r\n\r\n_From ——, Aug._ 20, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XIX.\r\n\r\nCecilia Volanges _to_ Chevalier Danceny.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou was so pensive, Sir, yesterday, and it gave me so much uneasiness\r\nto see you so, that I could not avoid promising to answer the letter\r\nyou wrote me. I now think it unbecoming; yet, as I promised, I will\r\nnot break my word, a proof of the friendship I have for you. Now I\r\nhave made this acknowledgment, I hope you will never more ask me to\r\nwrite to you again, or ever let any one know I have wrote to you; for\r\nI should most certainly be blamed, and it might occasion me a deal of\r\nuneasiness. But above all, I hope you will not have a bad opinion of\r\nme, which would give me the greatest concern; for I assure you, I\r\ncould not have been induced to do this by any one else. I wish much you\r\nwould not be so melancholy as you have been, lately, as it deprives me\r\nof all the satisfaction I have in your company. You see, Sir, I speak\r\nvery sincerely to you. I wish much that our friendship may be lasting;\r\nbut I beg you’ll write to me no more.\r\n\r\n         I have the honour to be,\r\n                     Cecilia Volanges.\r\n_Aug._ 20, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XX.\r\n\r\n_The_ Marchioness de Merteuil _to_ Viscount Valmont.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, knave, you begin to wheedle, lest I should laugh at you! Well, I\r\nforgive you. You say so many ridiculous things, that I must pardon\r\nyou, the trammels you are kept in by your Presidente; however, my\r\nChevalier would be apt not to be so indulgent, and not to approve\r\nthe renewal of our contract; neither would he find any thing very\r\nentertaining in your foolish whim. I laughed, however, exceedingly at\r\nit, and was truly sorry I was obliged to laugh alone. Had you been\r\nhere, I don’t know how far my good humour might have led me; but\r\nreflection came to my aid, and I armed myself with severity. It is not\r\nthat I have determined to break off for ever; but I am resolved to\r\ndelay for some time, and I have my reasons. Perhaps some vanity might\r\narise in the case, and _that_ once roused, one does not know whither\r\nit may lead. I should be inclined to enslave you again, and oblige you\r\nto give up your Presidente; but if a person of my unworthiness should\r\ngive you a disgust for virtue itself, in a human shape, what a scandal!\r\nTo avoid this danger, these are my stipulations.\r\n\r\nAs soon as you have obtain’d your lovely devotee, and that you can\r\nproduce your proofs, come, I am yours. But I suppose it unnecessary\r\nto inform you that, in important matters, none but written proofs\r\nare admitted. By this arrangement I shall, on the one hand, become a\r\nreward instead of a consolation, and this idea pleases me most: on the\r\nother hand, your success will be more brilliant, by becoming in the\r\nsame moment the cause of an infidelity. Come then, come speedily, and\r\nbring the pledge of your triumph; like our valiant knights of old, who\r\ndeposited, at their ladies’ feet, the trophies of their victories. I am\r\nreally curious to know what a prude can say after such an adventure;\r\nwhat covering she can give her words after having uncovered her person.\r\nYou are to judge whether I rate myself too high; but I must assure you\r\nbeforehand, I will abate nothing. Till then, my dear Viscount, you\r\nmust not be angry that I should be constant to my Chevalier; and that\r\nI should amuse myself in making him happy, although it may give you a\r\nlittle uneasiness.\r\n\r\nIf I was not so strict a moralist, I believe at this instant he would\r\nhave a most dangerous rival in the little Volanges. I am bewitched\r\nwith this little girl: it is a real passion. I am much mistaken, or\r\nshe will be one day or other one of our most fashionable women. I can\r\nsee her little heart expanding; and it is a most ravishing sight!—She\r\nalready loves her Danceny to distraction, yet knows nothing of it; and\r\nhe, though deeply smitten, has that youthful timidity, that frightens\r\nhim from declaring his passion. They are both in a state of mutual\r\nadoration before me: the girl has a great mind to disburden her heart,\r\nespecially for some days past; and I should have done her immense\r\nservice in assisting her a little; but she is yet a child, and I must\r\nnot commit myself. Danceny has spoke plainer; but I will have nothing\r\nto do with him. As to the girl, I am often tempted to make her my\r\npupil; it is a piece of service I’m inclined to do Gercourt. He gives\r\nme time enough, as he must remain in Corsica until October. I have in\r\ncontemplation to employ that time effectually, and to give him a well\r\ntrained wife, instead of an innocent convent pensioner. The insolent\r\nsecurity of this man is surprising, who dares sleep quietly whilst a\r\nwoman he has used ill is unrevenged! If the little thing was now here,\r\nI do not know what I might say to her.\r\n\r\nAdieu, Viscount—good night, and good success; but, for God’s sake,\r\ndispatch. Remember, if you let this woman slip, the others will blush\r\nat having been unconnected with you.\r\n\r\n_Aug._ 20, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXI.\r\n\r\n_From_ Viscount Valmont _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have at length, my dear friend, made an advance, and one of such\r\nimportance, that though it has not led to the full completion of my\r\nwishes, convinces me I am in the right road, and dispels my dread of\r\nhaving gone astray. I have at last made my declaration of love; and\r\nalthough the most obstinate silence was preserved, I have obtained\r\nan answer of the most flattering, unequivocal nature; yet, not to\r\nanticipate matters, but to recur to their origin: you may remember a\r\nspy was appointed over my proceedings; well, I determined this shameful\r\ntreatment should be converted into the means of public edification;\r\nand I laid my plan thus: I ordered my confident to look out for some\r\ndistressed person in the neighbourhood, who wanted relief. This you\r\nknow was not a very difficult discovery. Yesterday evening he informed\r\nme that the effects of a whole family were to be seized on as this\r\nmorning, for payment of taxes. I first took care to be certain that\r\nthere was neither woman nor girl in the house, whose age or appearance\r\ncould raise any suspicion of my intended scheme. When I was satisfied\r\nof this, I mentioned at supper that I intended going a shooting next\r\nday. Here I must do my Presidente justice; she certainly felt some\r\nremorse for the orders she had given; and not being able to overcome\r\nher curiosity, she determined to oppose my design. It would be\r\nexceedingly hot; I should probably injure my health; I should kill\r\nnothing, and fatigue myself in vain; and during this conversation, her\r\neyes, which spoke a plainer language than she perhaps intended, told\r\nme she wished those simple reasons should pass current. You may guess\r\nI did not assent to them, and even was proof against a smart invective\r\nupon shooting and sportsmen; I held my ground even against a little\r\ncloud of discontent that covered her celestial face during the rest of\r\nthe evening. I was at one time afraid she had revoked her orders, and\r\nthat her delicacy would mar all. I did not reflect sufficiently on the\r\nstrength of woman’s curiosity, and was mistaken; my huntsman cleared up\r\nmy doubts however that night, and I went to bed quite satisfied.\r\n\r\nAt daylight I rose, and set out. I was scarcely fifty yards from the\r\ncastle, when I perceived my spy at my heels. I began to beat about,\r\ndirecting my course across the fields towards the village I had in\r\nview; my amusement on the way was making the fellow scamper; who, not\r\ndaring to quit the high road, was often obliged to run over treble the\r\nground I went. My exertions to give him exercise enough, put me in a\r\nviolent heat, and I seated myself at the foot of a tree. And would you\r\nbelieve it, he had the insolence to slide behind a thicket not twenty\r\nyards from, me, and seat himself also. I once had a great inclination\r\nto send him the contents of my piece, which, though only loaded with\r\nsmall shot, would have cured his curiosity; but I recollected he was\r\nnot only useful, but even necessary to my designs, and that saved him.\r\nOn my arrival at the village, all was bustle; I went on, and inquired\r\nwhat was the matter, which was immediately related to me. I ordered the\r\ncollector to be sent for; and, giving way to my generous compassion,\r\nI nobly paid down fifty-six livres, for which five poor creatures\r\nwere going to be reduced to straw and misery. On this trifling act,\r\nyou can’t conceive the chorus of blessings the bystanders joined in\r\naround me—what grateful tears flowed from the venerable father of\r\nthe family, and embellished this patriarchal figure, which a moment\r\nbefore was hideously disfigured with the wild stamp of despair! While\r\ncontemplating this scene, a younger man, leading a woman with two\r\nchildren, advancing hastily towards me, said to them, “Let us fall\r\non our knees before this image of God;” and I was instantly surrounded\r\nby the whole family prostrate at my feet.\r\n\r\nI must acknowledge my weakness; my eyes were full, and I felt within me\r\nan involuntary but exquisite emotion. I was amazed at the pleasure that\r\nis felt in doing a benevolent act; and I’m inclined to think, those we\r\ncall virtuous people, have not so much merit as is ascribed to them.\r\nBe that as it may, I thought it fit to pay those poor people for the\r\nheart-felt satisfaction I had received. I had ten louis-d’ors in my\r\npurse, which I gave them; here acknowledgments were repeated, but not\r\nequally pathetic: the relief of want had produced the grand, the true\r\neffect; the rest was the mere consequence of gratitude and surprise\r\nfor a superfluous gift.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the unmerited benedictions of this family, I had some\r\nresemblance to the hero of a drama in the _denouement_ of a play.\r\nRemark that the faithful spy was observable in the crowd. My end was\r\nanswered: I disengaged myself from them, and returned to the castle.\r\n\r\nEvery thing considered, I applaud myself for my invention. This woman\r\nis well worth all my solicitude; and it will one day or other prove to\r\nbe my title to her: having, as I may say, thus paid for her beforehand,\r\nI shall have a right to dispose of her at my will, without having any\r\nthing to reproach myself with.\r\n\r\nI had almost forgot to tell you, that, to make the most of every thing,\r\nI begged the good people to pray for the success of my undertakings.\r\nYou shall now see whether their prayers have not already been in some\r\nmeasure efficacious. But I’m called to supper, and I should be too late\r\nfor the post, if I did not now conclude. I am sorry for it, as the\r\nsequel is the best. Adieu, my lovely friend! You rob me a moment of the\r\npleasure of seeing her.\r\n\r\n_Aug._ 20, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXII.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The_ Presidente de Tourvel _to_ Madame de Volanges.\r\n\r\nYou will, I doubt not, Madam, be desirous to be informed of an incident\r\nin the life of Mr. de Valmont, which seems to me to form a striking\r\ncontrast to all those that have been related to you. Nothing can be\r\nmore painful than to think disadvantageously of any one, or so grievous\r\nas to find those who have every qualification to inspire the love of\r\nvirtue, replete with vice; besides, you are so inclined to the exercise\r\nof the virtue of indulgence, that I think I can’t please you more, than\r\nin furnishing you motives for reconsidering any judgment you may have\r\nformed, that may be justly accused of rigour. Mr. Valmont now seems\r\nentitled to this favour, I may almost say to this act of justice, for\r\nthe following reason:\r\n\r\nThis morning he went on one of those excursions, which might have given\r\nroom to imagine a scheme in the neighbourhood; a supposition which, I\r\nmust own, I too hastily adopted.\r\n\r\nHappily for him, and still more happily for us, since it preserves us\r\nfrom an act of injustice, one of my people had occasion to go the same\r\nway;[1] and thus my fortunate, but censurable curiosity was satisfied.\r\nHe acquainted us that Mr. de Valmont, having found at the village of\r\n——, an unhappy family whose effects were on the point of being sold\r\nfor payment of taxes, not only discharged the debt for the poor people,\r\nbut even gave them a pretty considerable sum besides. My servant was\r\nwitness to this virtuous act; and informs me that the country people,\r\nin conversation, told him, that a servant, whom they described, and\r\nwho mine believes to belong to Mr. de Valmont, had been yesterday at\r\nthe village to make inquiry after objects of charity. This was not a\r\ntransitory fit of compassion; it must have proceeded from determined\r\nbenevolence, the noblest virtue of the noblest minds; but be it chance\r\nor design, you must allow, it is a worthy and laudable act; the bare\r\nrecital of it melted me to tears! I will add also still farther, to do\r\nhim justice, that when I mentioned this transaction, of which he had\r\nnot given the least hint, he begin by denying it to be founded; and\r\neven when he acquiesced, seemed to lay so little stress on it, that his\r\nmodesty redoubled its merit. Now tell me, most venerable friend, if\r\nM. de Valmont is an irretrievable debauchee? If he is so, and behaves\r\nthus, where are we to look for men of principle? Is it possible that\r\nthe wicked should participate with the good the extatic pleasures of\r\nbenevolence? Would the Almighty permit that a virtuous poor family\r\nshould receive aid from the hand of an abandoned wretch, and return\r\nthanks for it to his Divine Providence? And is it possible to imagine\r\nthe Creator would think himself honoured in hearing pure hearts pouring\r\nblessings on a reprobate? No; I am rather inclined to think that\r\nerrors, although they may have been of some duration, are not eternal;\r\nand I cannot bring myself to think, that the man who acts well, is\r\nan enemy to virtue. Mr. de Valmont is only, perhaps, another example\r\nof the dangerous effects of connections. I embrace this idea, and it\r\ngratifies me. If, on the one hand, it clears up his character in your\r\nmind, it will, on the other, enhance the value of the tender friendship\r\nthat unites me to you for life.\r\n\r\n                             I am, &c.\r\n\r\nP. S. Madame de Rosemonde and I are just going to see the poor honest\r\nfamily, and add our assistance to Mr. de Valmont’s. We take him with\r\nus, and shall give those good people the pleasure of again seeing\r\ntheir benefactor; which, I fancy, is all he has left us to do.\r\n\r\n_Aug._ 20, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Madame de Tourvel does not venture to say it is done by her order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n_The_ Viscount de Valmont _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nI broke off at our return to the castle. Now to my narrative: I had\r\nscarce time to dress and return to the saloon, where my charmer was\r\nmaking tapestry, whilst the curate read the gazette to my old aunt.\r\nI placed myself near the frame. Softer looks than usual, almost\r\nbordering on fondness, soon informed me the spy had made a report of\r\nhis business; and, in fact, the lovely woman could no longer keep the\r\nsecret; being under no apprehension of interrupting the good pastor,\r\nwhose utterance was perfectly in the pulpit style. I have also some\r\nnews to tell, said she, and immediately related my adventure with an\r\nexactitude that did honour to her historian’s accuracy. You may guess\r\nhow my modesty displayed itself; but who can stop a woman’s tongue, who\r\nunconsciously praises the man she loves? I determined to let her go on.\r\nOne would have imagined she was preaching the panegyric of some saint,\r\nwhilst I, not without a degree of hope, attentively observed every\r\ncircumstance that bore an appearance propitious to love: her animated\r\nlook, free action, and above all, the tone of her voice, which, by a\r\nsensible alteration, betrayed the emotion of her soul. She had scarcely\r\nfinished, when Madame de Rosemonde said, “Come, my dear nephew, let me\r\nembrace you.” I soon concluded the lovely panegyrist could not offer\r\nan objection to my saluting her in turn. She attempted to fly; but I\r\nsoon seized her in my arms; and far from being able to resist, she had\r\nscarce power to support herself. The more I contemplate this woman,\r\nthe more amiable she is. She hastened back to her frame, with every\r\nappearance of resuming her work, but in such confusion, that her hand\r\nshook, and at length obliged her to throw it aside.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, the ladies would visit the objects of my unaffected\r\ncharity; I accompanied them; but I shall spare you the unentertaining\r\nnarrative of this second scene of gratitude. My anxious heart, panting\r\nwith the delightful remembrance of what had passed, made me hasten our\r\nreturn to the Castle. On the road, my lovely Presidente, more pensive\r\nthan usual, spoke not a word; and I, entirely absorbed in the means of\r\nemploying the events of the day to advantage, was also silent. Madame\r\nde Rosemonde alone spoke, and could receive but few and short answers.\r\nWe must have tired her out, which was my design, and it succeeded to my\r\nwish. When we alighted she retired to her apartment, and left my fair\r\none and me tête-à-tête in a saloon, poorly lighted: gentle darkness,\r\nthou encourager of timid love!\r\n\r\nI had not much trouble to direct our conversation to my object. The\r\nfervour of my lovely preacher was more useful than my own skill. “When\r\nthe heart is so inclined to good,” said she, glancing a most enchanting\r\nlook, “how is it possible it should at the same time be prone to vice?”\r\n“I don’t deserve,” replied I, “either this praise or censure; and I\r\ncan’t conceive how, with so much good sense as you possess, you have\r\nnot yet discovered my character. Were my candour even to hurt me in\r\nyour opinion, you are still too deserving to with-hold my confidence\r\nfrom you. You’ll find all my errors proceed from an unfortunate\r\neasiness of disposition. Surrounded by profligates, I contracted their\r\nvices; I have, perhaps, even had a vanity in excelling them. Here\r\ntoo the sport of example, impelled by the model of your virtues, and\r\nwithout hope of ever attaining them, I have however endeavoured to\r\nfollow you: and, perhaps, the act you value so highly to-day would lose\r\nits merit, if you knew the motive!” (You see, my charming friend, how\r\nnearly I approached to the truth.) “It is not to me those unfortunate\r\npeople are obliged, for the relief they have experienced. Where you\r\nimagined you saw a laudable act, I only sought the means to please. I\r\nwas only, if I must so say, the feeble agent of the divinity I adore!”\r\n(Here she would have interrupted me, but I did not give her time.)\r\n“Even at this instant,” added I, “it is weakness alone extracts this\r\nsecret from me. I had resolved not to acquaint you of it; I had placed\r\nmy happiness in paying to your virtues, as well as your charms, a\r\npure and undiscoverable homage. But, incapable of deceit, with such\r\nan example of candour before me, I will not have to reproach myself\r\nwith any vile dissimulation. Imagine not that I dare offend you by a\r\ncriminal presumption. I know I shall be miserable; but I shall cherish\r\nmy sufferings: they are the proofs of the ardour of my love:—at your\r\nfeet, in your bosom, I will deposit my grievances; there will I\r\ngather strength to bear up against new sufferings; there I shall meet\r\ncompassion, mixed with goodness and consolation; for I know you’ll pity\r\nme. O thou whom I adore! hear me, pity me, help me.” All this time was\r\nI on my knees, squeezing her hands in mine; but she, disengaging them\r\nsuddenly, and covering her eyes with them, exclaimed, “What a miserable\r\nwretch am I!” and burst into tears. Luckily I had worked myself up to\r\nsuch a degree that I wept also; and taking her hands again, I bathed\r\nthem with my tears. This precaution was very necessary; for she was\r\nso much engaged with her own anguish, that she would not have taken\r\nnotice of mine, if I had not discovered this expedient to impress\r\nher with it. This also gave me leisure to contemplate her charming\r\nform—her attractions received additional embellishment from her tears.\r\nMy imagination began to be fired, and I was so overpowered, that I was\r\ntempted to seize the opportunity!\r\n\r\nHow weak we are, how much governed by circumstances! since I myself,\r\nforgetful of my ultimate design, risked losing, by an untimely triumph,\r\nthe charms of a long conflict, and the pleasing struggles that precede\r\na difficult defeat; and hurried away by an impetuosity excusable only\r\nin a raw youth, was near reducing Madame de Tourvel’s conqueror to\r\nthe paltry triumph of one woman more on his list. My purpose is, that\r\nshe should yield, yet combat; that without having sufficient force to\r\nconquer, she should have enough to make a resistance; let her feel her\r\nweakness, and be compelled to own her defeat. The sorry poacher takes\r\naim at the game he has surprised—the true huntsman runs it fairly\r\ndown. Is not this an exalted idea? But perhaps by this time I should\r\nhave only had the regret of not having followed it, if chance had not\r\nseconded my prudence.\r\n\r\nA noise of some one coming towards the saloon struck us. Madame de\r\nTourvel started in a fright, took a candle, and went out. There was no\r\nopposing her. It was only a servant. When I was certain who it was, I\r\nfollowed her. I had gone but a few steps, when, whether her fears or\r\nher discovering me made her quicken her pace, she flung herself into,\r\nrather than entered, her apartment, and immediately locked the door.\r\nSeeing the key inside, I did not think proper to knock; that would have\r\nbeen giving her an opportunity of too easy resistance. The happy simple\r\nthought of looking through the key-hole struck me, and I beheld this\r\nadorable woman bathed in tears, on her knees, praying most fervently.\r\nWhat deity dared she invoke? Is there one so powerful as the god of\r\nlove? In vain does she now seek for foreign aid; I am henceforward the\r\narbiter of her fate.\r\n\r\nThinking I had done enough for one day, I retired to my apartment, and\r\nsat down to write to you. I had hopes of seeing her again at supper;\r\nbut she sent word she was gone to bed indisposed. Madame de Rosemonde\r\nproposed to go to see her in her room; but the arch invalid pretended\r\na head-ach, that prevented her from seeing any one. You may guess I\r\ndid not sit up long after supper, and had my head-ach also. After I\r\nwithdrew, I wrote her a long letter, complaining of her rigour, and\r\nwent to bed, resolved to deliver it this morning. I slept badly, as\r\nyou perceive by the date of this letter. I rose and read my epistle\r\nover again, which does not please me: it expresses more ardour than\r\nlove, and more chagrin than grief. It must be altered when I return to\r\na sufficient degree of composure.\r\n\r\nIt is now dawn of day, and I hope the freshness of the morning will\r\nbring on a little sleep. I return to bed; and whatever ascendant this\r\nwoman may have over me, I promise you never to be so much taken up with\r\nher, as not to dedicate much of my thoughts to you. Adieu, my lovely\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n_Aug._ 21, 17—, _four o’clock in the morning._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nViscount Valmont _to the_ Presidente Tourvel.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom mere compassion, Madam, vouchsafe to calm my perturbed soul;\r\ndeign to inform me what I have to hope or fear. When placed between\r\nthe extremes of happiness and misery, suspense is a most insupportable\r\ntorment. Alas! why did I ever speak to you? Why did I not endeavour to\r\nresist the dominion of your charms that have taken possession of my\r\nimagination? Had I been content with silently adoring you, I should\r\nat least have the pleasure that ever attends even secretly harbouring\r\nthat passion; and this pure sentiment, which was then untroubled by\r\nthe poignant reflections that have arisen from my knowledge of your\r\nsorrow, was enough for my felicity: but the source of my happiness is\r\nbecome that of my despair, since I saw those precious tears; since I\r\nheard that cruel exclamation, _Ah! miserable wretch that I am._ Those\r\nwords, Madam, will for a long time wring my heart. By what fatality\r\nhappens it, that the softest passion produces only horror to you!\r\nWhence proceed these fears? Ah! they do not arise from an inclination\r\nof sharing in the passion. Your heart I have much mistaken; it is not\r\nmade for love: mine, which you incessantly slander, is yet the only\r\none of sensibility; yours is even divested of pity—were it not, you\r\ncould have afforded a wretched being, who only related his sufferings,\r\none word of consolation; you would not have deprived him of your\r\npresence, when his sole delight is in seeing you; you would not have\r\nmade a cruel mockery of his disquietude, by acquainting him you were\r\nindisposed, without giving him liberty to make any inquiries on the\r\nstate of your health; you would have known, that a night that brought\r\nyou twelve hours rest, was to him an age of torment.\r\n\r\nTell me, how have I deserved this afflicting rigour? I am not afraid\r\neven to appeal to yourself: what have I done, but yielded to an\r\ninvoluntary sensation, inspired by beauty, and justified by virtue,\r\nalways kept within due limits by respect, the innocent avowal of which\r\nproceeded from hopeless confidence? and will you betray that confidence\r\nthat you seemed to countenance, and to which I unreservedly gave way?\r\nNo, I will not believe it; that would be supposing you capable of an\r\ninjustice, and I never can entertain, even for a moment, such an idea:\r\nI recant my reproaches; I may have been led to write them, but never\r\nseriously believed them. Ah, let me believe you all perfection; it is\r\nthe only satisfaction now left me! Convince me you are so, by extending\r\nyour generous care to me; of the many you have relieved, is there a\r\nwretch wants it so much as I do? Do not abandon me to the distraction\r\nyou have plunged me into: assist me with your reason, since you have\r\ndeprived me of mine; and as you have reformed me, complete your work by\r\nenlightening me.\r\n\r\nI will not deceive you; it will be impossible for you to conquer my\r\nlove, but you may teach me how to regulate it: by guiding my steps,\r\nby prescribing to me my conversation, you will, at least, preserve me\r\nfrom the most dreadful of all misfortunes, that of incurring your\r\ndispleasure. Dispel, at least, my desponding fears; tell me you pity\r\nand forgive me; promise me your indulgence; you never will afford me\r\nthat extent of it I wish; but I call for so much of it as is absolutely\r\nnecessary to me: will you refuse it?\r\n\r\nAdieu, Madam! Accept, graciously, the homage of my feelings, to which\r\nmy respect is inseparably united.\r\n\r\n_Aug._ 20, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXV.\r\n\r\nViscount Valmont _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nI now transmit to you the proceedings of yesterday: at eleven I went\r\nto Madame de Rosemonde’s, and under her auspices, was introduced to\r\nthe fair pretended invalid, who was still in bed. Her eyes seemed very\r\nheavy; I hope she slept as badly as I did. I seized an opportunity,\r\nwhilst Madame de Rosemonde was at a distance, to present my letter; it\r\nwas refused, but I left it on the bed, and very politely approached\r\nmy old aunt’s easy chair, who would be near _her dear child_, to\r\nwhom it now became necessary to put up the letter to avoid scandal.\r\nShe indiscreetly said, she believed she had a little fever. Madame\r\nde Rosemonde desired I would feel her pulse, praising, at the same\r\ntime, my skill in physic: thus my enchantress experienced a double\r\nmortification, to be obliged to give me her arm, and to find her little\r\nartifice would be detected. I took her by the hand, which I squeezed\r\nin one of mine, whilst, with the other, I ran over her smooth delicate\r\narm; the sly being would not answer a single one of my inquiries,\r\nwhich made me say, as I retired, “I could not feel even the slightest\r\nemotion.” I suspected her looks would be rather severe; in order to\r\ndisappoint her, I did not look at her: a little after she said she was\r\ndesirous to rise, and we left her alone. She appeared at dinner, which\r\nwas rather gloomy, and informed us she would not go out to walk, which\r\nwas telling me I should not have an opportunity of speaking to her. It\r\nthen became necessary, and I felt this to be the fit place, to fetch a\r\nsigh and assume a melancholy look; she undoubtedly expected it, for it\r\nwas the first time, that day, our eyes met. With all her discretion,\r\nshe has her little artifices as well as others. I found an opportunity\r\nto ask her _if she had decided my fate?_ I was not a little astonished\r\nto hear her reply, _Yes, Sir, I have wrote to you._ I was very\r\nanxious to see this letter; but whether it was design, awkwardness,\r\nor timidity, she did not deliver it until night, when she retired to\r\nher apartment. I send it you, as also the rough copy of mine; read and\r\ngive your opinion; observe with what egregious falsity she protests\r\nshe is not in love, when I am certain of the contrary; and she’ll\r\ncomplain, if I deceive her afterwards, and yet is not afraid to deceive\r\nme beforehand!—My lovely friend, the most artful man is barely on a\r\nlevel with the most inexperienced woman. I must, however, give in to\r\nall this nonsense, and fatigue myself to death with despair, because\r\nMadam is pleased to play a severe character.—How is it possible not to\r\nresolve to avenge such indignities,—but patience! Adieu, I have still\r\na great deal to write.\r\n\r\nNow I think on’t, send me back the inhuman woman’s letter; it is\r\npossible that hereafter she may expect to find a great value set upon\r\nsuch wretched stuff, and one must be regular.\r\n\r\nI say nothing of little Volanges, she shall be our subject the first\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\n_Aug._ 22, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n_The_ Presidente de Tourvel _to_ Viscount Valmont.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou certainly, Sir, would not receive a letter from me, if my foolish\r\nconduct, last night, did not put me under the necessity of coming to\r\nan explanation. I wept I own; and the words you cite may have escaped\r\nme; tears, words, and every thing you have carefully noted; it is then\r\nnecessary to explain all:\r\n\r\nBeing accustomed to inspire only becoming sentiments, and habituated\r\nonly to conversations that I might attend to without a blush, and\r\nconsequently to possess a degree of confidence, which, I flatter\r\nmyself, I have a right to, I am a stranger to dissimulation, and know\r\nnot how to suppress the sensations which I experience. The astonishment\r\nand confusion your behaviour threw me into, an unaccountable dread,\r\nfrom a situation not at all suited to me, and perhaps the shocking\r\nthought of seeing myself confounded with the women you despise, and\r\ntreated with the same levity; all these reasons united, provoked my\r\ntears, and may have made me, and I think with reason, say, I was\r\nmiserable.\r\n\r\nThis expression, which you think so pointed, would be still certainly\r\ntoo weak, if my tears and words had another motive; if instead of\r\ndisapproving sentiments that ought to offend me, I had the slightest\r\napprehension of participating them.\r\n\r\nNo, Sir, I have no such apprehensions; if I had, I should fly a\r\nhundred leagues from you; I would fly to some desert, there to bewail\r\nthe misfortune of having known you. Notwithstanding my certainty of not\r\nhaving, or ever having, an affection for you, perhaps I should have\r\nacted more properly, in following the advice of my friends, in never\r\npermitting you to approach me.\r\n\r\nI thought, and that is my only error, that you would have had some\r\nrespect for a woman of character, whose wish was to find you deserve\r\na similar appellation, and to do you justice, and who pleaded in your\r\nvindication, whilst you were insulting her by your criminal designs:\r\nno, Sir, you do not know me, or you would not thus presume, upon your\r\nown injustice, and because you have dared to speak a language I should\r\nnot have listened to, you would not have thought, yourself, to write\r\nme a letter I ought not to read; and you desire I should _guide\r\nyour steps, and prescribe your conversation!_ Well, Sir, silence and\r\noblivion is the only advice that is suitable for me to give, and you\r\nto follow; then, only, will you have a title to pardon: you might even\r\nobtain some title to my gratitude—but no, I shall make no request to\r\na man who has lost all respect for me; I will not repose confidence in\r\none who has already abused it. You oblige me to fear, nay, perhaps, to\r\nhate you, which was not my wish; I hoped to see in you the nephew of my\r\nmost respectable friend; I opposed the voice of friendship to that of\r\nthe public that accused you: you have destroyed all; and I foresee you\r\nwill not be disposed to regain any thing.\r\n\r\nI shall content myself with informing you, Sir, your sentiments offend\r\nme; that your declaration of them is an insult, and far from ever\r\nthinking to partake of them, you’ll oblige me never to see you more,\r\nif you don’t observe, on this subject, a silence, which I think I have\r\na right not only to expect, but to require. I enclose you the letter\r\nyou wrote me, and I hope you will, in the same manner, return me this:\r\nI should be extremely mortified that any traces should remain, of an\r\nevent which ought never to have existed.\r\n\r\n                         I have the honour,\r\n_Aug._ 21, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nCecilia Volanges _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow shall I thank you, dear Madam, for your goodness: you judged well\r\nthat it would be easier for me to write than speak; what I have to\r\ntell you is not an easy matter; but you are my friend! Yes, you are my\r\nvery good friend! And I’ll endeavour not to be afraid; and then I have\r\nso much occasion for your advice!—I am in great grief; I think every\r\none guesses my thoughts, especially when he is present; I redden up as\r\nsoon as any one looks at me. Yesterday, when you saw me crying, it was\r\nbecause I wanted to speak to you, and I don’t know what hindered me;\r\nwhen you asked me what ailed me, the tears came into my eyes in spite\r\nof me. I could not have spoke a word. If it had not been for you, Mamma\r\nwould have taken notice of it; and then what would have become of me?\r\nThis is the way I spend my time for these four days: that day, Madam, I\r\nwill out with it, on that day Chevalier Danceny wrote to me; I assure\r\nyou, when I received his letter, I did not know what it was; but to\r\ntell the truth, I read it with great pleasure. I would have suffered\r\nany thing all my lifetime, rather than he should not have wrote it to\r\nme; however, I know very well I must not tell him so; and I can even\r\nassure you, that I told him I was very angry; but he says it gets the\r\nbetter of him, and I believe him; for I had resolved not to answer him,\r\nand yet I could not avoid it. I wrote him but once, it was partly even\r\nto tell him not to write to me any more; yet he is continually writing;\r\nand as I don’t answer him, I see plainly he is very melancholy, and\r\nthat afflicts me greatly: so that I do not know what to do, nor what\r\nwill become of me: I am much to be pitied!\r\n\r\nI beg, Madam, you’ll tell me, would there be any great harm in writing\r\nan answer to him now and then, only until he can prevail on himself to\r\nwrite me no more, and to be as we used to be before? For myself, if\r\nit continues this way, I don’t know what I shall do. I assure you, on\r\nreading his last letter, I could not forbear crying all the time; and\r\nI am very certain, that if I do not answer him again, it will make us\r\nboth very uneasy.\r\n\r\nI will enclose you his letter, or a copy of it, and you’ll see he does\r\nnot ask any harm. However, if you think it is not proper, I promise\r\nyou I will not give way to my inclination; but I believe you’ll think\r\nas I do, that there’s no harm in it.\r\n\r\nAnd now that I am upon it, give me leave to put you a question: I have\r\nbeen often told it was very wrong to be in love with any body, but\r\nwhy so? What makes me ask you, is this; the Chevalier Danceny insists\r\nthere’s no harm at all in it, and that almost every body is; if that’s\r\nthe case, I don’t know why I should be the only one should be hindered;\r\nor is it that it is only wrong for young ladies? For I heard Mamma\r\nherself say, that Madam de D—— loved M. M——, and she did not speak\r\nas if it was so bad a thing; and yet I am sure she would be very angry\r\nwith me, if she had the least suspicion of my affection for M. Danceny.\r\nShe behaves to me always as if I was a child, and never tells me any\r\nthing at all. I thought, when she took me from the convent, I was to\r\nbe married; but now I think not. It is not that I care much about it,\r\nI assure you; but you who are so intimate with her, you, perhaps, know\r\nsomething about it; and if you do, I hope you will tell me.\r\n\r\nThis is a very long letter, Madam; but since you was so good to give me\r\nleave to write to you, I made use of it to tell you every thing, and I\r\ndepend on your friendship.\r\n\r\n                         I have the honour, &c.\r\n_Paris, Aug._ 23, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nChevalier Danceny _to_ Cecilia Volanges.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou still, Miss, refuse to answer my letters. Will nothing move you?\r\nand must every day banish the hopes it brings! What sort of friendship\r\nis it that you consent shall subsist between us? If it is not powerful\r\nenough even to make you sensible of my anguish; if you can coolly,\r\nand unmoved, look on me, while I suffer, the victim of a flame which\r\nI cannot extinguish; if, instead of inspiring you with a confidence\r\nin me, my sufferings can hardly move your compassion.—Heavens! your\r\nfriend suffers, and you will do nothing to assist him. He requests\r\nonly one word, and you refuse it him! And you desire him to be\r\nsatisfied with a sentiment so feeble, that you even dread to repeat\r\nit. Yesterday you said you would not be ungrateful. Believe me, Miss,\r\nwhen a person repays love only with friendship, it arises not from a\r\nfear of being ungrateful: the fear then is only for the appearance of\r\ningratitude. But I no longer dare converse with you on a subject which\r\nmust be troublesome to you, as it does not interest you; I must, at all\r\nevents, confine it within myself, and endeavour to learn to conquer it.\r\nI feel the difficulty of the task; I know I must call forth my utmost\r\nexertions: there is one however will wring my heart most, that is,\r\noften to repeat, yours is insensible.\r\n\r\nI will even endeavour to see you less frequently; and I am already\r\nbusied in finding out a plausible pretence. Must I then forego the\r\npleasing circumstance of daily seeing you; I will at least never cease\r\nregretting it. Perpetual anguish is to be the reward of the tenderest\r\naffection; and by your desire, and your decree, I am conscious I never\r\nshall again find the happiness I lose this day. You alone were formed\r\nfor my heart. With what pleasure shall I not take the oath to live only\r\nfor you! But you will not receive it. Your silence sufficiently informs\r\nme that your heart suggests nothing to you in my favour; that is at\r\nonce the most certain proof of your indifference, and the most cruel\r\nmanner of communicating it. Farewell, Miss.\r\n\r\nI no longer dare flatter myself with receiving an answer; love would\r\nhave wrote it with eagerness, friendship with pleasure, and even\r\npity with complacency; but pity, friendship, and love, are equally\r\nstrangers to your heart.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Aug._ 23, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nCecilia Volanges _to_ Sophia Carnay.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is certain, Sophy, that I told you, one might in some cases write to\r\nan admirer; and I assure you, I am very angry with myself for having\r\nfollowed your advice, which has been the cause of so much uneasiness\r\nto the Chevalier Danceny and me; and what proves I was right, is, that\r\nMadame de Merteuil, who is a woman that ought to know those things\r\nperfectly, has at length come to think as I do. I owned every thing to\r\nher: at first she thought as you did; but when I had explained every\r\nthing to her, she was sensible it was a different case: she requires\r\nonly that I should show her all my letters, and those of Chevalier\r\nDanceny, to be certain I should say nothing but what I ought; so now I\r\nam pretty easy. Lord! how I do love Madame de Merteuil; she is a good\r\nwoman, and a very respectable one; so that her advice may be safely\r\nfollowed. Oh! how I shall write to M. Danceny, and how well satisfied\r\nhe’ll be; he will be more so than he thinks; for, till now, I only\r\nmentioned friendship to him, and he wanted me always to call it love.\r\nI believe it was pretty much the same; but I was afraid—that was the\r\nfact. I told Madame de Merteuil of it; she told me I was in the right;\r\nand that an avowal of love ought only to be made when one could no\r\nlonger help it: now I’m sure I cannot help it much longer; after all,\r\nit is all one, and it will please him most.\r\n\r\nMadame de Merteuil told me also, that she would lend me some books,\r\nwhich treat that subject very fully, and would teach me how to conduct\r\nmyself, and also to write better than I do: for she tells me all my\r\nfaults, and that is a proof she loves me; she charged me only to say\r\nnothing to Mamma of those books, because it would look as if she had\r\nneglected my education, and that might displease her. I will engage I\r\nshall say nothing of it.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, very extraordinary, that a woman, who is but a very\r\ndistant relation, should take more care of me than my mother! I am very\r\nhappy to be acquainted with her.\r\n\r\nShe has asked my Mamma leave to take me to the opera, to her own box,\r\nthe day after to-morrow; she told me we should be by ourselves, and\r\nwould chat all the while, without danger of being overheard.—I like\r\nthat a great deal better than the opera. My marriage will be, in part,\r\nthe subject of our conversation, I hope; for she told me it was very\r\ncertain I was to be married; but we had not an opportunity to say any\r\nmore. Is it not very strange Mamma says nothing at all to me about it.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear Sophy; I am going to write to Chevalier Danceny. I am\r\nquite happy.\r\n\r\n_Aug._ 24, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXX.\r\n\r\nCecilia Volanges _to the_ Chevalier Danceny.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last, Sir, I consent to write to you, to assure you of my\r\nfriendship, of my _love_ even, since without that you must be unhappy.\r\nYou say I have not a tender heart: I assure you you are much mistaken;\r\nand I hope you now doubt it no longer. If you were uneasy because I\r\ndid not write to you, do you think it did not give me a great deal of\r\nconcern too? The reason was, I would not, for all the world, do any\r\nthing that was wrong; and I should not even have owned my affection\r\nfor you, if I could have helped it; but your grief gave me too much\r\nuneasiness. I hope now you will be so no longer, and that we shall be\r\nvery happy.\r\n\r\nI expect to have the pleasure of seeing you this evening, and that you\r\nwill come early; it will not be as much so as I wish. Mamma sups at\r\nhome, and I believe she will ask you to stay. I hope you will not be\r\nengaged, as you was the day before yesterday. Surely the company you\r\nwent to sup with must have been very pleasing, for you went very soon;\r\nbut let us talk no more of that. Now that you know I love you, I hope\r\nyou will be with me as often as you can; for I am never pleased but\r\nwhen with you; and I wish, with all my heart, you were the same.\r\n\r\nI am very sorry you should still be melancholy; but it is not my fault.\r\nI shall desire to play on the harpsichord as soon as you come, that you\r\nmay have my letter immediately. I think that is the best thing I can\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nFarewell, Sir; I love you with all my heart; the oftener I tell you so,\r\nthe more happy I feel. I hope you will be so too.\r\n\r\n_Aug._ 24, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nChevalier Danceny _to_ Cecilia Volanges.\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, certainly, we shall be very happy. My happiness is secure, since\r\nI am beloved by you. Yours will never end, if it lasts as long as my\r\nlove. And do you love me, and no longer dread telling me so? _The\r\noftener you tell me so, the more happy you feel._ After having read\r\nthe enchanting _I love you,_ wrote with your hand, I heard your lovely\r\nmouth repeat the avowal. I figured to me those charming eyes, rendered\r\nstill more so by the expression of tenderness fixed on me. I have\r\nreceived your vows to live for me alone. Oh receive mine, to devote my\r\nlife to your happiness, and be assured I never will deceive you!\r\n\r\nWhat a happy day was yesterday! Why has not Madame de Merteuil always\r\nsecrets to impart to your Mamma? Why must the idea of the restraint\r\nthat attends us, be mixed with the delicious remembrance that fills my\r\nsoul? Why can’t I for ever squeeze that lovely hand, that wrote _I love\r\nyou,_ imprint it with my kisses, and be thus revenged for your refusal\r\nof a greater favour?\r\n\r\nTell me, then, my Cecilia, when your Mamma came back, when, by her\r\npresence, we were constrained to behave with indifference to each\r\nother, when you could no longer console me by assurances of love, for\r\nthe refusal of proof, did not you feel some sorrow? did not you say to\r\nyourself, one kiss would have made him completely happy, and refused\r\nit? Promise me, my lovely charmer, that you’ll be not so rigorous the\r\nfirst opportunity. Such a promise will enable me to bear up against the\r\ndisappointments that I foresee are preparing for us, and the crosses I\r\nshall meet, will at least be softened by the certainty that you share\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my adorable Cecilia! The hour is come that I am to be with you.\r\nIt would be impossible for me to leave off, if it was not to go to you.\r\nAdieu, once more, my dearest love!\r\n\r\n_Aug._ 25, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nMadame de Volanges _to the_ Presidente de Tourvel.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou wish then, Madam, that I should form a good opinion of the virtue\r\nof Monsieur de Valmont? I own I cannot bring myself to it; and that I\r\nshould have as much difficulty to think so from the simple fact you\r\nrelate, as to believe a man of acknowledged worth to be vicious for\r\nthe commission of one fault. Human nature is not perfect in any shape,\r\nneither in good nor evil. The profligate wretch has his virtues as well\r\nas the virtuous man his weaknesses. This truth is so much the more\r\nnecessary to be believed, because, from thence arises the necessity of\r\nindulgence for the wicked as well as the good; and that it preserves\r\nthese from pride, and those from being discouraged. You will, without\r\ndoubt, think that I don’t now practise the doctrine I speak; but it\r\nappears to me a most dangerous weakness, to put the man of virtue and\r\nthe profligate on an equality.\r\n\r\nI will not take upon me to scrutinize the motives of Mr. Valmont’s\r\naction; I’ll even think it in itself laudable; but nevertheless, has he\r\nnot, all his life, been employed in spreading trouble, dishonour, and\r\nscandal in families? Listen, if you will, to the voice of the unhappy\r\npeople he has relieved: but let not that prevent you from attending\r\nto the cries of a hundred victims that he has sacrificed. If, as you\r\nsay, he was only one example of the danger of connections, would he\r\nbe the less a dangerous connection? You suppose him capable of a\r\nhappy reformation: let us go farther, suppose this miracle completed;\r\nwould not the public opinion be still against him, and ought not that\r\nto be sufficient to regulate your conduct? God alone can absolve at\r\nthe moment of repentance; he is the searcher of hearts; but men can\r\njudge only by actions; and no one, after having lost the esteem of\r\nthe world, has a right to complain of diffidence, which makes this\r\nloss so difficult to be repaired. I would have you think above all, my\r\ndear young friend, that to lose this esteem, it is sometimes enough to\r\nseem to set little value upon it, and do not tax this severity with\r\ninjustice; for as the world has a right to think that no one renounces\r\nthis precious jewel, who has good pretensions to it, whoever is not\r\nrestrained by this consideration, is on the brink of danger. Such,\r\nhowever, would be the aspect, an intimate connection with Mr. de\r\nValmont would carry with it, were it ever so innocent.\r\n\r\nAlarmed with the warmth with which you defend him, I hasten to\r\nanticipate the objections I foresee you’ll make. You’ll quote Madame\r\nde Merteuil, whose connection with him has escaped censure; you’ll\r\nperhaps ask me why I admit him to my house? You will tell me, that far\r\nfrom being rejected by the worthy part of society, he is admitted, even\r\nsought for, by what is called good company: I can, I believe, answer to\r\nall.\r\n\r\nMadame de Merteuil, who is really a very valuable woman, has, perhaps,\r\nno other defect but that of too much confidence in her own strength;\r\nshe is a dexterous guide, who delights in driving her chariot between\r\nrocks and precipices, in which her success alone justifies her: it is\r\nright to praise her, but it would be imprudent to follow her; she\r\nherself is convinced, and condemns herself for it, and as she grows in\r\nexperience, her conduct is more reserved; and I can confidently assure\r\nyou, we are both of the same opinion.\r\n\r\nAs to what relates to myself, I will not excuse it more than in others;\r\nI admit Mr. de Valmont: without doubt he is received every where;\r\nthat is an inconsequence to be added to the many others that govern\r\nsociety. You know as well as me, that we spend our lives in remarking,\r\ncomplaining, and giving ourselves up to them. Mr. de Valmont, with a\r\npompous title, a great fortune, many amiable qualities, saw early,\r\nthat to gain an ascendant in society, it was sufficient to know how\r\nto manage with equal address, praise, and ridicule. No one, like him,\r\npossesses this double talent; with the one he seduces, with the other\r\nhe makes himself dreaded: he is not esteemed, but flattered. Such is\r\nhis existence in the midst of a world, that, more prudent than bold,\r\nwould rather keep on good terms with him than combat him.\r\n\r\nBut neither Madame de Merteuil nor any other woman would venture to\r\nshut herself up in the country, almost tête-à-tête, with such a man. It\r\nwas reserved for the most discreet, and the most virtuous among them,\r\nto set an example of such an inconsequence; pardon the expression,\r\nit slipped from me through friendship. My charming friend, even your\r\nvirtue betrays you, by the security it inspires you with. Think, then,\r\non the one hand, that you will have for judges frivolous people, who\r\nwill not believe in a virtue, the model of which they cannot find\r\namong themselves; and on the other, profligates, who will feign not\r\nto believe in it to punish you. Consider you are now doing what many\r\nmen would be afraid to risk; for among the young men of fashion, to\r\nwhom Mr. de Valmont is now become the oracle, the most prudent seem to\r\ndread appearing too intimately connected with him; and you are under\r\nno apprehensions; ah, return, I conjure you! If my reasons are not\r\nsufficient to persuade you, at least give way to my friendship; it is\r\nit that makes me renew my instances, it is it must justify them. You\r\nwill think it severe, and I wish it may be useless; but I would much\r\nrather you should have reason to complain of its solicitude, than its\r\nnegligence.\r\n\r\n_Aug._ 24, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\n_The_ Marchioness de Merteuil _to the_ Viscount de Valmont.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that you dread succeeding, my dear Viscount, now that your scheme\r\nis to furnish arms against yourself, and that you wish more to fight\r\nthan conquer, I have nothing more to say. Your conduct is certainly a\r\nmasterpiece of prudence; in a contrary supposition, it would be the\r\nhighest act of folly; and to tell you my sentiments freely, I fear your\r\nproject is entirely chimerical.\r\n\r\nI do not reproach you for having let slip the opportunity; for I really\r\ncannot see that you had it in your power; and I know well, whatever\r\nothers may say, that an opportunity lost may be found again, and that a\r\nrash step is irrecoverable.\r\n\r\nBut I admire your wisdom in commencing a correspondence, and I defy\r\nyou to foresee how it will end. You perhaps hope to prove to this\r\nwoman, that she should give herself up? And that seems to me a truth of\r\nopinion, more than of demonstration; and that to make it be relished,\r\nyou soften, and not argue; but what purpose would it answer to soften\r\nby letter, since you would not be on the spot to benefit by it? If all\r\nyour fine phrases should even produce the intoxication of love, do you\r\nflatter yourself that it would be of so long a duration that reflection\r\nwould not come time enough to prevent its consequences? Think, then,\r\nhow much it will take to write a letter, and how much before it can be\r\ndelivered; and then consider if a woman, of the principles of your\r\ndevotee, can think so long on what she endeavours never at all to think\r\nof: this proceeding may do very well with children, who while they\r\nwrite, I love you, do not know they say I give myself up to you; but\r\nMadame de Tourvel’s reasoning virtue makes her know the value of the\r\nterms. This appears very plain; for notwithstanding the advantage you\r\nhad over her in your conversation, she foils you in her letter; and\r\nwhat will be the consequence? That by long debating, you will not bring\r\nto compliance; that by dint of searching for good reasons, she will\r\nfind them, will give them, and stick to them; not so much because they\r\nare good in themselves, as not to act inconsistently.\r\n\r\nMoreover, a remark I am astonished you have not made, is, that nothing\r\nis so difficult in love, as to write what one does not feel. I mean to\r\nwrite with the appearance of truth; it is not but the same phrases are\r\nused; they are not arranged in the same manner; or rather, they are\r\narranged with too much perspicuity, and that is worse.\r\n\r\nRead over your letter again; it displays so much regularity that you\r\nare discovered in every phrase. I am inclined to think your Presidente\r\nis so unfashionable as not to perceive it; but what is that to the\r\npurpose? the consequence will be still the same; that is the defect\r\nof romance; the author racks his brain, heats his imagination, and\r\nthe reader is unmoved. Heloise is the only exception I know; and\r\nnotwithstanding the great talents of the author, from this observation\r\nalone, I have ever been of opinion, that the work is grounded in\r\ntruth; not so in speaking; the custom of conversation gives it an air\r\nof tenderness, to which the facility of tears still greatly adds;\r\nexpressive desires blend themselves with the languishing look, and,\r\nat last, incoherent speeches more readily bring on that turbulence\r\nof passion, which is the true eloquence of love; but above all, the\r\npresence of the beloved object banishes reflection, and makes us wish\r\nto be overcome.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, my dear Viscount, she does not desire you should write any\r\nmore; retrieve your error, and wait for the opportunity of speaking\r\nto her. This woman has more fortitude than I expected; her defence is\r\ngood, and were it not for the length of her letter, and the pretence\r\nshe gives you for a replication in her grateful phrase, she would not\r\nat all have betrayed herself.\r\n\r\nAnd what, I think, ought to ascertain your success is, she exhausts all\r\nher strength at once; and I foresee she will persist in it, for the\r\ndefence of a word, and will have none left for the crisis.\r\n\r\nI send you back your two letters, and, if you are prudent, they should\r\nbe the last till after the happy moment. It is too late to say any\r\nthing of the little Volanges, who comes on very well, and gives me\r\ngreat satisfaction. I believe I shall have done before you, which ought\r\nto make you very happy. Farewell for to-day!\r\n\r\n_Aug._ 24, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nViscount Valmont _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou write enchantingly, my charming friend; but why take so much\r\ntrouble to prove a position which all the world knows, that to make\r\na quick progress in love matters, it is better to speak than write?\r\nThis, I believe, is the full contents of your letter; and is it not the\r\nfirst elements of the art of seduction? I will only remark, that you\r\nmake but one exception to this principle, and that there are two: with\r\nchildren, who take this step through timidity, and give themselves up\r\nthrough ignorance, you must add the women of genius, who are dupes to\r\nself-love and vanity, which leads them into the snare. For example;\r\nI am very certain that the Countess de B——, who answered, without\r\nhesitating, my first letter, had then no more affection for me, than I\r\nhad for her; and that in this connection she had no other view, than\r\nbeing engaged with a person whom she imagined would do her honour.\r\n\r\nHowever, a lawyer will tell you, that the maxim is not applicable to\r\nthe question; for you suppose that it is at my option to write or\r\nspeak, which is not the case. Since the affair of the 20th, my cruel\r\ncharmer, who keeps on the defensive, has studiously avoided meeting\r\nme, a piece of address which totally disconcerts me: so that if it\r\nshould continue, she will oblige me to think seriously on the means\r\nof regaining this advantage; as I most assuredly will not be baffled\r\nby her in this manner; even my letters are the occasion of a little\r\nwarfare: not satisfied with giving no reply, she even refuses receiving\r\nthem, and I am under the necessity of a new stratagem for each, which\r\ndoes not always succeed.\r\n\r\nYou may recollect in what a simple manner I delivered the first;\r\nthe second was not more difficult. She required I should return her\r\nletter; I gave her mine instead of it, without her having the least\r\nsuspicion. But whether from vexation to have been duped, whether\r\nthrough capriciousness or virtue, for she will oblige me to believe she\r\nis virtuous, she has obstinately refused the third. I expect, however,\r\nfrom the embarrassment that this refusal had like to put her in, she\r\nwill in future be more cautious.\r\n\r\nHowever, I was not much astonished that she would not receive that\r\nletter, which I offered her in a very plain manner—that would have\r\nbeen granting something—and I expect a longer defence. After this\r\neffort, which was only an essay by way of trial, I put a cover over my\r\nletter, and taking the opportunity when she was at her toilette, when\r\nMadame de Rosemonde and her waiting-maid were present, I sent it her by\r\nmy huntsman, ordering him to tell her that it was the paper she asked\r\nme for. I rightly judged that she would dread a scandalous explanation,\r\nwhich a refusal would necessarily have brought on; and indeed she took\r\nthe letter. My ambassador, who had orders to observe her countenance\r\ndiligently, and who is a shrewd fellow, perceived only a slight blush,\r\nwith more embarrassment than anger.\r\n\r\nI applauded myself, being very certain that she would either keep this\r\nletter, or, if she meant to return it, she must take an opportunity\r\nwhen we were alone, and then could not avoid a conference. About an\r\nhour after, one of her people came into my room, from his mistress,\r\nand delivered me a packet, folded in another form than my own, on the\r\ncover of which I immediately perceived the long-wished-for characters.\r\nI broke the seal with rapture—Behold! it was my own letter, unsealed,\r\nand doubled down.—I suspect she dreaded I was not so scrupulous as\r\nshe, on the score of scandal, which made her invent this diabolical\r\nstratagem. You know me well—I have no occasion to describe the rage\r\nthis put me into. However, I was obliged to be calm, and to think of\r\nother means—and this is the only one I could think of:—\r\n\r\nEvery morning there is a man sent for the letters from this to the post\r\noffice, which is about three quarters of a league; for this purpose a\r\nsmall box, in the shape of a trunk, is made use of; the master of the\r\npost office keeps one key, and Madame de Rosemonde the other. Every one\r\nputs in their letters when they think proper, and they are carried at\r\nnight to the post office: in the morning the messenger goes back for\r\nthose that arrive. All the servants, strangers and others, take it in\r\nturn. It was not my servant’s turn; but he offered to go, on pretence\r\nthat he had business there.\r\n\r\nI wrote my letter. I disguised the superscription in a feigned hand,\r\nand counterfeited tolerably, on the cover, the post mark of _Dijon_. I\r\nchose this town in a gay humour, as I wished for the same rites as the\r\nhusband; I also wrote from the same place; and likewise because my fair\r\none had been all day expressing her wish to receive letters from Dijon,\r\nI thought it but right to give her that satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThose precautions taken, it was a matter of no difficulty to mix this\r\nletter with the others; and I still had it in view to be witness to\r\nits reception; for the custom is to assemble together at breakfast,\r\nand wait the arrival of the letters before we separate. At length they\r\narrived.\r\n\r\nMadame de Rosemonde opened the box. “From Dijon,” said she, giving the\r\nletter to Madame de Tourvel. “It is not my husband’s writing,” replied\r\nthe other, in some confusion, breaking open the seal immediately. The\r\nfirst glance informed her who it came from, and made such a change in\r\nher countenance, that Madame de Rosemonde took notice of it, and said,\r\n“What ails you?” I immediately drew near, saying, “This letter must be\r\nvery dreadful indeed!” The timorous devotee did not lift up her eyes,\r\nnor speak a syllable; and to conceal her embarrassment, feigned to run\r\nover the letter, which she was scarce able to read. I enjoyed her\r\nuneasiness; and wishing to push it a little farther.—“Your easy air,”\r\nreplied I, “makes me hope that this letter has been the occasion of\r\nmore astonishment than grief.” Her anger then overpowered her prudence.\r\n“It contains,” replied she, “things that offend me much; and that I am\r\nastonished any one would dare write to me.” And “who then can it be?”\r\nreplied Madame de Rosemonde. “It is not signed,” replied the angry\r\nfair; “but the letter and its author I equally despise: and I shall\r\ntake it as a favour to say no more about it.” So saying, she tore the\r\naudacious epistle, put the scraps in her pocket, rose, and went out.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all this anger, she nevertheless has my letter; and I\r\ndepend upon her curiosity that she will read it.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of this day would lead me too far. I enclose you\r\nthe rough draft of my two letters, which will acquaint you with every\r\nthing. If you wish to know the course of this correspondence, you must\r\naccustom yourself to decypher my minutes; for I would not for the world\r\ntake the trouble of copying them. Adieu, my lovely friend!\r\n\r\n_Aug._ 25, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nViscount Valmont _to the_ Presidente de Tourvel.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou must be obeyed, Madam; and I must convince you, that,\r\nnotwithstanding all the faults you are pleased to think me guilty\r\nof, I have yet at least so much delicacy as not to suffer a single\r\nreproach to escape my lips, and sufficient resolution to impose on\r\nmyself the most painful sacrifice. You command me to be silent, and\r\nto forget you. Well, I shall constrain my love to be silent, and,\r\nif possible, I shall forget the cruel manner in which it has been\r\nreceived. Undoubtedly my wish to please gave me no right to it; and I\r\nmust farther acknowledge, that the necessity I was under of having your\r\nindulgence, was not a sufficient title to obtain it: but you consider\r\nmy love as an atrocious affront; you forget that if it is a fault, you\r\nare at once both the cause and the apology for it. You forget also,\r\nthat accustomed as I was to lay open my soul to you, even when that\r\nconfidence might be detrimental to me, it was no longer possible for\r\nme to hide the sentiments with which I was affected; and what is the\r\nresult of sincerity, you look upon as the effect of arrogance; and\r\nin recompence of the most tender, the most respectful, and the most\r\nsincere love, you drive me far from you. You even threaten me with your\r\nhatred. Where is the man who would not complain to be so treated? But I\r\nsubmit, and suffer all without murmuring. You strike, and I adore! The\r\ninconceivable ascendant you have obtained over me, has rendered you\r\nsole mistress of my sentiments; and if my love alone disobeys, if you\r\ncannot destroy it, it is because it is your own work, not mine.\r\n\r\nI ask no return; that I never flattered myself with: I don’t even\r\nimplore that pity which the concern you seem to take for me flattered\r\nme with the hope of; but I believe, I own, I have a right to claim your\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nYou inform me, Madam, that some persons have endeavoured to prejudice\r\nme in your esteem. If you had given credit to the advice of your\r\nfriends, you would not have even suffered me to approach you. Those\r\nare your terms; who then are those officious friends? Certainly those\r\npeople of such severe morals, and such rigid virtue, will have no\r\nobjection to give up their names; they certainly would not take shelter\r\nbehind the same screen with the vilest of slanderers; and I shall\r\nthen be no longer ignorant of their name and their charge. Consider,\r\nMadam, I have a right to know both one and the other, since you judge\r\nme from their report. A criminal is never condemned without being told\r\nhis crime, and naming his accusers. I ask no other favour; and I,\r\nbeforehand, engage to make good my justification, and to compel them to\r\nretract.\r\n\r\nIf I have, perhaps, too much despised the empty clamours of the public,\r\nwhich I set little value on, it is not so with your esteem; and when\r\nI consecrate my whole life to merit it, it shall not be ravished from\r\nme with impunity. It becomes so much the more precious to me, as I\r\nshall, without doubt, owe to it the request you fear to make me, and\r\nwhich, you say, would give me a right to your gratitude. Ah! far from\r\nrequiring any, I shall think myself highly indebted to you, if you can\r\nassist me with an opportunity of being agreeable to you.\r\n\r\nBegin then by doing me more justice, and let me be no longer ignorant\r\nof what you wish me to do; if I could guess at it, I would save you\r\nthe trouble of telling it me. To the pleasure of seeing you, add the\r\nhappiness of serving you, and I shall extol your indulgence. What then\r\ncan prevent you; it is not, I hope, the dread of a refusal? That,\r\nI feel, I should never be able to pardon you. It is not one not to\r\nreturn you your letter. I wish more than you that it may no longer\r\nbe necessary to me; but accustomed as I am to believe you so soft a\r\ndisposition, it is in this letter only that I can find you such as\r\nyou wish to appear. When I form the vow of endeavouring to make you\r\nsensible to my flame, I feel that you would fly a hundred leagues from\r\nme, rather than consent; when your accomplishments justify and augment\r\nmy passion, it still tells me that it insults you; and when in your\r\npresence this passion is my supreme good, I feel that it is my greatest\r\ntorment. You may now conceive that my greatest happiness would be to\r\nreturn you this fatal letter: to ask it again would give me a kind of\r\nauthority to believe its contents. After this, I hope you will not\r\ndoubt of my readiness to return it.\r\n\r\n_Aug._ 21, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nViscount Valmont _to the_ Presidente de Tourvel.\r\n\r\n(_Post mark from Dijon._)\r\n\r\n\r\nYour severity, Madam, increases daily; and permit me to say, you seem\r\nto dread more being indulgent than unjust. After passing judgment on me\r\nwithout giving me a hearing, you must certainly be sensible it was less\r\ndifficult not to read my reasons than to answer them. You obstinately\r\nrefuse to receive my letters; you return them contemptuously; and\r\nyou force me to use artifice at the very instant that my sole object\r\nis to convince you of my integrity. The obligation you lay me under\r\nof defending myself, will, I hope, apologize for the means I am\r\nconstrained to use. Moreover, as I am convinced, that to be justified\r\nin your mind, it will be sufficient that the sincerity of my sentiments\r\nshould be laid open to you, I thought this innocent stratagem might be\r\nforgiven. I will, then, dare hope that you will forgive it; and that\r\nyou will not be much surprised that love is more industrious to show\r\nitself than indifference is to banish it.\r\n\r\nPermit me then, Madam, to lay my heart entirely open to you. It is\r\nyours, and it is but right you should know it.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived at Madame de Rosemonde’s, I little imagined the fate\r\nthat awaited me. I knew not you was here; and I must add with the\r\nsincerity that characterises me, had I known it, my repose would not\r\nhave been disturbed: not but that I should have rendered that homage\r\nto your beauty it so justly requires; but being long accustomed to\r\nexperience only desires, to surrender only to those where my hopes\r\nflattered success, I knew nothing of the torments of love. You was\r\nwitness to the pressing instances of Madame de Rosemonde, to detain\r\nme some time. I had already spent one day with you: at length I\r\nacquiesced, or rather thought I acquiesced, to the pleasure so natural\r\nand reasonable, of paying a proper regard to so respectable a relation.\r\n\r\nThe manner of living here undoubtedly differed widely from that I had\r\nbeen accustomed to; yet I perceived no difficulty in conforming to\r\nit, and without ever thinking of diving into the cause of so sudden a\r\nchange, I attributed it solely to that easiness of temper, which, I\r\nbelieve, I have already mentioned to you.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately (but why must it be a misfortune?) knowing you more, I\r\nsoon discovered that that enchanting form, which alone had raised my\r\nadmiration, was the smallest of your attractions; your celestial soul\r\nastonished and seduced mine; I admired your beauty, but adored your\r\nvirtue. Without a thought of obtaining you, I was resolved to deserve\r\nyou; seeing your indulgence for my past follies, I was ambitious to\r\nmerit your approbation for the future.\r\n\r\nI sought it in your conversation, I watched for it in your looks; in\r\nthose looks which diffused a poison so much more dangerous, as it\r\nspread without design, and was received without diffidence.\r\n\r\nThen I knew what was love; but far from complaining, resolved to bury\r\nit in eternal silence. I gave way without dread or reserve to this\r\nmost delicious sentiment. Each day augmented its power; and soon the\r\npleasure of seeing you became a necessity. Were you absent a moment,\r\nmy heart was oppressed; at the noise of your approach it fluttered with\r\njoy. I no longer existed but by you and for you; and yet I call on\r\nyourself to witness, if ever in the gaiety of rural amusements, or in\r\nthe more serious conversations, a word ever escaped from me that could\r\nbetray the secret of my heart.\r\n\r\nAt length the day arrived which gave birth to my misfortune; and by an\r\ninconceivable fatality, a worthy action gave the signal. Yes, Madam,\r\nit was in the midst of the poor wretches I had delivered, that giving\r\nway to that precious sensibility that embellishes beauty itself, and\r\nenhances virtue, you led a heart astray which was already too much\r\nintoxicated by love.\r\n\r\nYou may, perhaps, recollect, what a gloom spread over me at my return.\r\nAlas, I was totally employed in combating a passion which I found was\r\noverpowering me!\r\n\r\nIt was after having exhausted all my strength and reason in this\r\nunequal combat, that an accident I could not have foreseen, left us\r\nalone; then I own I was overcome. My full heart could neither command\r\nmy words or tears; but is it then a crime? And if it be one, is it not\r\nsufficiently punished by the racking torments to which I am devoted?\r\n\r\nConsumed by a hopeless love, I implore your pity, and you return\r\nme hate: no other happiness in view but that of gazing on you, my\r\nunconscious eyes seek you, and I tremble to meet your looks. In the\r\ndeplorable state to which you have reduced me, I pass my days in\r\nconcealing my sorrows, and my nights in cherishing them; whilst you,\r\ntranquil and peaceful, only know them by having been the cause, and\r\nenjoying it; and yet it is you that complain, and I excuse myself.\r\n\r\nThis is, notwithstanding, a true recital of what you call injuries,\r\nwhich rather deserve to be called misfortunes. A pure and sincere love,\r\na profound respect, and an entire submission, are the sentiments with\r\nwhich you have inspired me. I should not dread to present such homage\r\neven to the Divinity. Oh thou, who art one of his most beautiful works,\r\nimitate his mercy, think on my cruel torments; above all, think that as\r\nyou have put me between the supremest felicity and despair, the first\r\nword you pronounce will for ever decide my fate!\r\n\r\n_Aug._ 23 ,17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\n_The_ Presidente de Tourvel _to_ Madame de Volanges.\r\n\r\n\r\nI submit, Madam, to the sympathetic voice of friendship. Long\r\naccustomed to have a deference to your advice, I am led to believe it\r\nalways founded in reason. I will even acknowledge that Mr. de Valmont\r\nmust be exceedingly dangerous indeed, if he can assume the character\r\nhe puts on here, and be the man you represent him. However, since you\r\nrequire it, I will do all in my power to remove him hence if possible;\r\nfor it often happens that things, very simple in themselves, become\r\nextremely embarrassing through forms.\r\n\r\nIt appears, however, totally impracticable to make this requisition to\r\nhis aunt; it would be equally revolting to both. I would not, without\r\ngreat reluctance, even determine to quit this place; for besides the\r\nreasons I already wrote you relative to Mr. de Tourvel, if my departure\r\nshould be contrary to Mr. de Valmont’s wishes, as is not impossible,\r\ncould he not readily follow me to Paris? And his return, of which I\r\nshould be, or, at least, appear to be, the object, would it not seem\r\nmuch more extraordinary than an accidental meeting in the country, at a\r\nlady’s who is known to be his relation, and my particular friend?\r\n\r\nI have, then, no other resource left but to prevail on him to leave\r\nthis place. I am aware of the difficulties I have to encounter in such\r\na proposal; yet as he seems to make it a point to convince me, that he\r\nis not the unprincipled character he has been represented to me, I\r\nhope to succeed. I shall even be glad of an opportunity to be satisfied\r\nwhether (to use his own words) the truly virtuous females ever had, or\r\never will have occasion to complain of his conduct. If he goes, as I\r\nhope he will, it will certainly be in deference to my request; for I\r\nhave no manner of doubt of his intention to spend a great part of the\r\nautumn here; but if, on the contrary, he should obstinately refuse me,\r\nit will be time enough for me to depart, which I promise you I will do.\r\n\r\nThis I believe, Madam, is all your friendship requires of me: I shall\r\neagerly gratify it, and convince you, that notwithstanding _the warmth_\r\nwith which I have defended Mr. de Valmont, I am nevertheless disposed\r\nnot only to hear, but also to follow the advice of my friends.\r\n\r\n_From ——, Aug._ 25, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\n_The_ Marchioness de Merteuil _to_ Viscount Valmont.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear Viscount, I this moment received your enormous packet. If the\r\ndate is right, I should have had it twenty-four hours sooner; however,\r\nwas I to take the time to read it, I should not have any to answer\r\nit; therefore, I prefer owning its receipt, and let us chat on other\r\nmatters. It is not that I have any thing to say relative to myself; for\r\nthe autumn has left nothing in Paris scarce that bears the human form,\r\nand for this month past, my prudence and discretion are truly amazing;\r\nany other than my Chevalier would be tired out with my constancy.\r\nHaving no other amusement, I divert myself with the little Volanges,\r\nwho shall be the subject of this epistle.\r\n\r\nDo you know you have lost more than you can imagine, in not taking\r\nthis child under your tuition? She is really delightful; she has\r\nneither disposition or motive; you may then guess her conversation is\r\nmild and easy. I do not think she will ever shine in the sentimental\r\nline; but every thing announces the most lively sensations. Without\r\nwit or artifice, she has, notwithstanding, a certain kind of natural\r\nduplicity, if one may speak so, which sometimes astonishes me, and will\r\nbe much more successful, as her figure exhibits the picture of candour\r\nand openness. She is naturally very caressing, and she sometimes\r\nentertains me: her imagination is surprisingly lively; and she is the\r\nmore agreeable, as she is totally ignorant, and longs to know every\r\nthing. Sometimes she takes fits of impatience that are truly comic; she\r\nlaughs, she frets, she cries, and then begs of me to instruct her, with\r\na most seducing innocence. I am almost jealous of whoever that pleasure\r\nis reserved for.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether I wrote you, that for four or five days past I\r\nhad the honour to be her confident. You may guess at first I affected\r\nan appearance of severity; but when I observe that she imagined I was\r\nconvinced with her bad reasons, I let them pass current; and she is\r\nfully persuaded it is entirely owing to her eloquence: this precaution\r\nwas necessary, lest I should be exposed. I gave her leave to write and\r\nsay, _I love_; and the same day, without her having any suspicion, I\r\ncontrived a tête-à-tête for her with her Danceny. But only think, he is\r\nsuch a fool, he has not yet obtained a single kiss from her. However,\r\nthe boy makes pretty verses. Lord, what stupid creatures those wits\r\nare! He is so much so, that he makes me uneasy; for I am resolved not\r\nto have any thing to do with him.\r\n\r\nNow is the time you might be very useful to me. You are enough\r\nacquainted with Danceny to gain his confidence; and if he once gave it\r\nyou, we should go on at a great rate. Make haste with your Presidente,\r\nfor I am determined Gercourt shall not escape. I spoke to the little\r\nthing yesterday about him, and painted him in such colours, that she\r\ncould not hate him more were she married to him for ten years. However,\r\nI gave her a long lesson on conjugal fidelity; nothing is equal to my\r\nseverity on this point. By this means I establish my reputation for\r\nvirtue, which too great a condescension might destroy; and increase the\r\nhatred with which I mean to gratify her husband. And, lastly, I hope,\r\nby making her think it is not lawful to indulge in a love matter only\r\nduring the short time she is unmarried, she will come to a decision\r\nmore expeditiously to lose no time.\r\n\r\nAdieu, Viscount! I shall read your volume at my toilette.\r\n\r\n_Aug._ 27, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nCecilia Volanges _to_ Sophia Carnay.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear Sophia, I am very melancholy and uneasy. I have wept almost the\r\nwhole night. Not but that at present I am very happy; but I foresee it\r\nwill not last long.\r\n\r\nI was at the opera last night with Madame de Merteuil; we chatted a\r\ngood deal of my match; I am not much pleased with the husband she\r\nannounces to me. She tells me I am to be married next October, to the\r\nCount de Gercourt: he is of a noble family, rich, and colonel of the\r\nregiment of ——; that is all very well. But, on the other hand, he is\r\nold—he is almost six and thirty. Madame de Merteuil says he is morose\r\nand ill-tempered; and she dreads much I shall not be happy with him. I\r\neven perceived plainly she spoke as if she was certain of it, though\r\nshe would not speak out, for fear of giving me uneasiness. She dwelt\r\nalmost the whole evening on the duties of wives to their husbands: she\r\nacknowledges Mr. de Gercourt is not at all amiable, and yet, she says,\r\nI must love him. She has even told me that when I am married, I must\r\nnot love Chevalier Danceny, as if that was in my power! I assure you I\r\nshall ever love him; or rather would never be married at all. Let Mr.\r\nde Gercourt take the consequence—he is not the man of my choice. He\r\nis now in Corsica—a great distance. I wish with all my heart he may\r\nstay there these ten years. If I was not afraid of being sent back to\r\nthe convent, I would tell mamma that he is not agreeable to me; but to\r\ndo that might be still worse. I don’t know how to act. I never loved\r\nMr. de Danceny as much as I do now; and when I think I have only one\r\nmonth more to be as I am, the tears burst into my eyes immediately. I\r\nhave no consolation but in Madame de Merteuil’s friendship; she is so\r\ntender hearted, she unites with me in all my sorrows; and then she is\r\nso amiable, that when I am in her company, I think no more of them;\r\nbesides, she is very useful to me, for she has taught me what little I\r\nknow; and she is so good natured, I can tell her every thing I think\r\nof, without being at all ashamed. When she thinks it not right, she\r\nsometimes chides me, but always very gently: whenever that happens I\r\nspare no endeavours to appease her. She, at least, I may love as much\r\nas I will, and there is no harm in that; which gives me great pleasure.\r\nHowever, we have agreed that I must not appear so fond of her before\r\nevery one, and especially before mamma, lest she should entertain any\r\nsuspicion on the score of the Chevalier Danceny. I assure you, if\r\nI could always live as I now do, I should think myself very happy.\r\nNothing torments me but this horrid Gercourt! But I shall say no more\r\nof him: I find if I did, I should be melancholy. I will go write to\r\nChevalier Danceny, and will only talk to him of my love, and will not\r\ntouch any subject that may distress him.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear friend. You now find you are wrong in complaining of my\r\nsilence; and that notwithstanding _the busy life I lead_, as you call\r\nit, I have still time to love and write to you.[1]\r\n\r\n _Aug._ 27, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We shall hereafter suppress Cecilia Volanges and Chevalier\r\nDanceny’s letters, being uninteresting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XL.\r\n\r\n_The_ Viscount de Valmont _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy inhuman mistress not content with declining an answer to my letters,\r\nand even refusing to receive them, she endeavours to deprive me of the\r\npleasure of seeing her, and insists I should quit this place. What will\r\nsurprise you more is, that I have acquiesced in every thing. You will,\r\nno doubt, blame me. Yet I thought I should not let slip the opportunity\r\nof receiving her commands; being, on the one hand, convinced, that\r\nwhosoever commands is responsible, and on the other, that the imaginary\r\nair of authority we give the women, is the most difficult snare for\r\nthem to escape: besides, the precautions she has taken not to be with\r\nme alone, put me in a very dangerous situation, which I thought it\r\nprudent to be extricated from at all events: for being incessantly with\r\nher, without being able to direct her attention to the subject of love,\r\nit was the more to be dreaded she would become accustomed to see me\r\nwith indifference—a disposition of mind which you very well know is\r\nseldom overcome.\r\n\r\nYou may judge I did not acquiesce without making conditions. I even\r\ntook care to stipulate for one impossible to be performed; not only\r\nthat I may be at liberty to keep or break my word, but engage in a\r\ndiscussion, either verbally or in writing, whenever my fair one might\r\nbe more satisfied with me, or feel the necessity of relaxing. I should\r\nhave ill managed indeed, if I did not obtain an equivalent for giving\r\nup my pretensions, though they are not of a justifiable nature.\r\n\r\nHaving laid before you my reasons in this long exordium, I begin the\r\nhistory of the two last days. I shall annex, as proofs, my fair one’s\r\nletter with my answer. You will agree with me few historians are more\r\nexact than I am.\r\n\r\nYou may recollect the effect my letter from Dijon had the day before\r\nyesterday. The remainder of that day was rather tempestuous. The pretty\r\nprude did not make her appearance until dinner was on the table, and\r\ninformed us she had got a bad head-ach; a pretence for concealing the\r\nmost violent ill humour that ever possessed woman. Her countenance was\r\ntotally altered; the enchanting softness of her tone was changed to a\r\nmoroseness that added new beauty to her. I shall make a good use of\r\nthis discovery in future; and convert the tender mistress into the\r\npassionate one.\r\n\r\nI foresaw the evening would be dull; to avoid which, I pretended to\r\nhave letters to write, and retired to my apartment. I returned about\r\nsix to the Saloon; Madame de Rosemonde proposed an airing, which was\r\nagreed to. But the instant the carriage was ready, the pretended sick\r\nlady, by an act of infernal malice, pretended, in her turn, or, perhaps\r\nto be revenged of me for my absence, feigned her head-ach much worse,\r\nand forced me to undergo a tête-à-tête with my old aunt. I don’t know\r\nwhether my imprecations against this female demon had their effect; but\r\nshe was in bed at our return.\r\n\r\nNext morning, at breakfast, she was no more the same woman: her natural\r\nsweetness had returned, and I had reason to think my pardon sealed.\r\nBreakfast being over, the lovely woman arose with an easy air, and\r\nwalked towards the park; I soon followed her, as you may imagine.\r\n“Whence arises this inclination for a walk?” said I, accosting her. “I\r\nhave wrote a great deal this morning,” she replied, “and my head is\r\na little fatigued.”—“I am not so happy,” replied I, “as to have to\r\nreproach myself with being the cause of that fatigue.”—“I have wrote\r\nyou,” said she, “but I hesitate to deliver my letter:—it contains\r\na request, and I fear I must not flatter myself with success.”—“I\r\nswear if it be possible.”—“Nothing more easy,” replied she; “and\r\nthough perhaps you ought to grant it from a motive of justice, I will\r\nconsent even to obtaining it as a favour.” She then delivered me her\r\nletter, which I took, as also her hand, which she drew back, without\r\nanger, and more confusion than vivacity. “The heat is more intense\r\nthan I imagined,” said she; “I must return.” In vain did I strive to\r\npersuade her to continue our walk;—she returned to the Castle;—and\r\nwere it not for the dread of being seen, I would have used other means\r\nas well as my eloquence. She returned without uttering a syllable; and\r\nI plainly saw this pretended walk had no other object than to deliver\r\nme her letter. She retired to her apartment, and I to mine, to read\r\nher epistle. I beg you will read that, and my answer, before you go\r\nfarther.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLI.\r\n\r\n_The_ Presidente de Tourvel _to_ Viscount Valmont.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour behaviour towards me, Sir, has the appearance of your seeking\r\nopportunities to give me more reason to complain of your conduct than\r\nI hitherto have had. Your obstinacy in teasing me incessantly with a\r\nsubject that I neither will or ought to attend to; the ill use you\r\nhave made of my candour, or timidity, to convey your letters to me;\r\nbut, above all, the indelicate manner you imagined to hand me the\r\nlast, without having paid the least attention to the consequences of a\r\nsurprise which might have exposed me, would authorise me to reproach\r\nyou in terms as severe as merited. But I am inclined, instead of\r\nrenewing my complaint, to bury all in oblivion, provided you agree to a\r\nrequest as simple as it is just.\r\n\r\nYou yourself have told me, Sir, I ought not to apprehend a denial;\r\nalthough, from an inconsistency which is peculiar to you, this phrase\r\nwas even followed by the only refusal you had in your power to give,[1]\r\nI am still disposed to think you will, on this occasion, keep a promise\r\nyou so formally and so lately made.\r\n\r\nI require, therefore, you would retire from hence, and leave me, as\r\nyour residence here any longer will expose me to the censure of the\r\npublic, which is ever ready to paint things in the worst colours, and\r\na public whom you have long habituated to watching such women as have\r\nadmitted you into their society.\r\n\r\nThough my friends have for some time given me notice of this danger, I\r\ndid not pay proper attention to it; I even combated their advice whilst\r\nyour behaviour to me gave me reason to think you did not confound me\r\nwith the crowd of women who have reason to lament their acquaintance\r\nwith you. Now that you treat me in the same manner, and that I can\r\nno longer mistake, it is a duty I owe to the public, my friends, and\r\nmyself, to take the necessary resolution. I might also add, that a\r\ndenial would avail little, as I am determined, in case of a refusal, to\r\nleave this place immediately.\r\n\r\nI do not seek to lessen the obligation your complaisance will lay me\r\nunder; and will not conceal from you, that if you lay me under the\r\nnecessity of leaving this, you will put me to inconvenience. Convince\r\nme then, Sir, as you have often told me, that a woman of virtue will\r\nnever have reason to complain of you: show me, at least, that if you\r\nhave ill treated such a woman, you are disposed to atone for the injury\r\nyou have done her.\r\n\r\nDid I think my request required any justification in your sight, it\r\nwould be enough, I think, to tell you the whole conduct of your life\r\nmakes it necessary; it is not my fault a reformation has not taken\r\nplace. But I will not recall events that I wish to forget, and which\r\nwould lead me to pass a severe sentence on you at the time I am\r\noffering you an opportunity of deserving my utmost gratitude. Farewell,\r\nSir. Your determination will tell me in what light I am to behold you\r\nfor life.\r\n\r\n                         Your most humble, &c.\r\n_Aug._ 25, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See Letter the 35th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLII.\r\n\r\nViscount de Valmont _to the_ Presidente de Tourvel.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough the conditions you impose on me, Madam, are severe indeed,\r\nI shall not refuse to comply; for I perceive it is impossible for\r\nme to oppose any of your wishes. As we are agreed on this point,\r\nI dare flatter myself that, in return, you will permit me to make\r\nsome requests, much easier to be granted than yours, and which,\r\nnotwithstanding, I don’t wish to obtain but through a perfect\r\nresignation to your will.\r\n\r\nThe one, which I hope your justice will suggest, is, to name my\r\naccusers; I think the injury they have done me authorises me to demand\r\nwho they are: the other request, for which I crave your indulgence, is,\r\nto permit me sometimes to renew the homage of a passion, which now,\r\nmore than ever, will deserve your pity.\r\n\r\nReflect, Madam, that I am earnest to obey you, even at the expence of\r\nmy happiness; I will go farther, notwithstanding my conviction, that\r\nyou only wish my absence to rid you of the painful sight of the victim\r\nof your injustice.\r\n\r\nBe ingenuous, Madam; you dread less the public censure, too long used\r\nto reverence you, to dare to harbour a disadvantageous opinion of you,\r\nthan to be made uneasy by the presence of a man, whom it is easier to\r\npunish than to blame. You banish me on the same principle that people\r\nturn their eyes from the miserable wretches they do not choose to\r\nrelieve.\r\n\r\nAnd then absence will redouble my torments; to whom but you can I\r\nrelate my grievances? From what other person am I to expect that\r\nconsolation, which will become so necessary in my affliction? Will you,\r\nwho are the cause, refuse me that consolation?\r\n\r\nBe not surprised, neither that before my departure, I should endeavour\r\nto justify my sentiments for you, nor that I shall not have the\r\nresolution to set out, until I receive the order from your own mouth.\r\n\r\nThose reasons oblige me to request a moment’s interview. It would be\r\nin vain to think that a correspondence by letter would answer the end.\r\nVolumes often cannot explain what a quarter of an hour’s conversation\r\nwill do. You will readily find time to grant me this favour; for,\r\nnotwithstanding my eagerness to obey you, as Madame de Rosemonde is\r\nwell apprised of my design to spend a part of the autumn with her, I\r\nmust, at all events, wait the return of the post, to pretend a letter\r\nof business obliging me to return.\r\n\r\nFarewell, Madam; never till now did I experience the force of this\r\nexpression, which recalls to me the idea of my separation from you.\r\nIf you could conceive how distressingly it affects me, my obedience\r\nwould find me some favour in your sight. Receive, however, with more\r\nindulgence, the homage of the most tender and respectful passion.\r\n\r\n_Aug._ 26,17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sequel to the Fortieth Letter._\r\n\r\n_From the_ Viscount de Valmont _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, my lovely friend, let us discuss this affair a little. You readily\r\nconceive, that the virtuous, the scrupulous Madame de Tourvel, cannot\r\ngrant the first of my requests—that of informing me who my accusers\r\nare, without a breach of friendship: thus, by promising every thing\r\non that condition, I am not at all committed; and you must be very\r\nsensible, that the negative she must give me, will give me a title to\r\nall my other objects; so that, by leaving this place, I shall obtain\r\nthe advantage of a regular correspondence, with her own consent; for I\r\ndon’t set great value upon the interview that I ask, by which I mean\r\nno more than to accustom her beforehand not to refuse other personal\r\napplications to her, when I shall have real occasion for them.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that remains to be done before my departure is, to know\r\nwho are those that take the trouble to prejudice me in her opinion.\r\n\r\nI presume it is that pedantic scoundrel her husband; I wish it may;\r\nfor, as a conjugal prohibition is a spur to desire, I should be certain\r\nthat from the moment of gaining her consent to write to me, I should\r\nhave nothing more to fear from the husband, because she would then find\r\nherself under the necessity of deceiving him.\r\n\r\nAnd if she has a confidential friend, and that friend should be against\r\nme, I think it will be necessary to raise a cause of misunderstanding\r\nbetween them, in which I hope to succeed: but, in the first place, I\r\nmust see my way clear.\r\n\r\nI imagined yesterday I had attained that necessary preliminary; but\r\nthis woman does not act like any other. We were in her apartment when\r\ndinner was announced. She had just time to finish her toilet; and from\r\nher hurry, and making apologies, I observed her leave the key in her\r\nbureau; and she always leaves the key in her chamber door. My mind was\r\nfull of this during dinner. When I heard her waiting-maid coming down\r\nstairs, I instantly feigned a bleeding at the nose, and went out. I\r\nflew to the bureau, found all the drawers open, but not a single paper;\r\nyet there is no occasion to burn them, situated as she is. What can she\r\ndo with the letters she receives? and she receives a great many. I left\r\nnothing unexamined; all was open, and I searched every where; so that I\r\nam convinced this precious deposit is confided only to her pocket.\r\n\r\nHow they are to be got at, my mind has been fruitlessly employed ever\r\nsince yesterday in contriving means: I cannot conquer my inclination\r\nto gain possession of them. I often regret that I have not the talent\r\nof a pickpocket. Don’t you think it ought to be made a part of the\r\neducation of a man of intrigue? Would it not be humorous enough to\r\nsteal a letter or a portrait of a rival, or to extract from the pocket\r\nof a prude, materials to unmask her? But our forefathers had no ideas:\r\nit is in vain for me to rack my brains; for it only convinces me of my\r\nown inability, without furnishing me any remedy.\r\n\r\nI returned to dinner very dissatisfied: my fair one however brought me\r\ninto good humour, by her anxious enquiries on my feigned indisposition:\r\nI did not fail to assure her that I had for some short time, violent\r\nagitations, which impaired my health. As she is persuaded the cause\r\nproceeded from her, ought she not in conscience endeavour to calm\r\nthem? Although a devotee, she has very little charity; she refuses any\r\ncompliance to supplications of love; and this refusal appears to me\r\nsufficient to authorise any theft to obtain the object. But adieu; for\r\nalthough I am writing to you, my mind is taken up with those cursed\r\nletters.\r\n\r\n_Aug._ 27, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLIII.\r\n\r\n_The_ Presidente de Tourvel _to the_ Viscount de Valmont.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy, Sir, do you endeavour at a diminution of my gratitude to you? Why\r\nobey me only by halves, and in some measure make a bargain of a simple,\r\ngenteel act? It is not, then, sufficient that I am sensible of its\r\nvalue! You not only ask a great deal of me, but you demand what it is\r\nimpossible to grant. If my friends have talked of you to me, they could\r\nonly do so from regard for me: should they even be mistaken, their\r\nintention was not the less good; and yet you require that I should\r\nrepay this proof of their esteem, by giving you up their names. I must\r\nown I have been very wrong in acquainting you of it; and I now feel it\r\nin a very sensible manner. What would have been only candour with any\r\none else, becomes imprudence with you, and would be a crime was I to\r\nattend to your request. I appeal to yourself, to your honour; how could\r\nyou think me capable of such a proceeding? Ought you even to have made\r\nme such a proposition? No, certainly; and I am sure, when you reflect,\r\nyou will desist from this request.\r\n\r\nThe other you make of writing to me is little easier to grant; and if\r\nyou will think a moment, you cannot in justice blame me. I do not mean\r\nto offend you; but after the character you have required, and which you\r\nyourself confess to have partly merited, what woman can avow holding a\r\ncorrespondence with you? And what virtuous woman could resolve to do\r\nthat which she would be obliged to conceal?\r\n\r\nIf I was even certain that your letters would be such as would give\r\nme no cause of discontent, and that I could always be conscious I was\r\nsufficiently justified in receiving them, then, perhaps, the desire\r\nof proving to you that reason, not hatred, guided me, would make me\r\nsurmount those powerful considerations, and cause me to do what I ought\r\nnot, in giving you sometimes permission to write to me; and if, indeed,\r\nyou wish it as much as you express, you will readily submit to the only\r\ncondition that can possibly make me consent to it: and if you have any\r\ngratitude for this condescension, you will not delay your departure a\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nGive me leave to make one observation on this occasion: you received\r\na letter this morning, and you did not make use of that opportunity\r\nto acquaint Madame de Rosemonde of your intended departure as you\r\npromised me; I now hope that nothing will prevent you from keeping your\r\nword. I hope much that you will not wait for the interview you ask,\r\nwhich I absolutely will not agree to; and that, instead of the order\r\nthat you pretend to be so necessary, you will be satisfied with my\r\nrequest, which I again renew to you. Farewell, Sir!\r\n\r\n_Aug._ 27, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLIV.\r\n\r\nViscount de Valmont _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nShare in my joy, my charming friend; I am loved; I have at length\r\ntriumphed over that rebellious heart. In vain does she still\r\ndissemble; my happy address has discovered the secret. Thanks to my\r\nunremitting efforts, I know all that interests me: since last night,\r\nthat propitious night, I am again myself; I have discovered a double\r\nmystery of love and iniquity; I shall enjoy the one, and be revenged\r\nof the other; I shall fly from pleasure to pleasure. The bare idea of\r\nit transports me almost beyond the bounds of prudence; and yet I shall\r\nhave occasion for some of it, to enable me to put any proper order in\r\nmy narrative; but let us try:\r\n\r\nYesterday, after I had wrote my letter, I received one from the\r\ncelestial devotee; I send it enclosed; you will observe she with less\r\nawkwardness than might be expected, gives me leave to write to her;\r\nyet presses my departure, which I well knew I could not defer without\r\nprejudice to myself. However, tempted by a curiosity to know who had\r\nwrote against me, I was still undetermined how to act. I attempted\r\nto bribe her chamber-maid, to induce her to give me her mistress’s\r\npockets, which she could easily do at night, and replace them the next\r\nmorning, without giving the least suspicion. I offered ten louis d’ors\r\nfor this trifling service; but I found her a hesitating, scrupulous, or\r\ntimid creature, whom neither my eloquence nor money could bring over. I\r\nwas using farther solicitations, when the bell rung for supper. I was\r\nthen obliged to break off; and thought myself very happy in obtaining\r\nfrom her a promise to keep my secret, on which, however, you may\r\nbelieve I placed little dependence.\r\n\r\nI never was more out of humour. I found I had committed myself, and\r\nreproached myself much for the imprudent step I had taken.\r\n\r\nAfter I retired in great anxiety, I spoke to my huntsman, who was\r\nentitled, as a successful lover, to some share of credit. I desired\r\nhe would prevail on this girl to do what I required, or at least to\r\ninsure secrecy: he, who in general makes no doubt of success in any\r\nthing he undertakes, appeared dubious of this negociation, and made\r\na reflection, the depth of which astonished me: “You certainly know\r\nbetter than I can tell you, Sir,” said he, “that to kiss a girl is\r\nnothing more than to indulge her in a fancy of her own, and that,\r\nthere is a wide difference often between that and making her act\r\naccording to our wishes; and I have so much less dependence on her, as\r\nI have much reason to think she has another swain, and that I only owe\r\nmy good fortune to her want of occupation in the country; and had it\r\nnot been for my zeal for your service, Sir, I should not have sought\r\nit more than once (this lad is a treasure). As to the secret,” added\r\nhe, “what purpose will it answer to make her promise, since she will\r\nrisk nothing in deceiving us? To speak of it again, would only make her\r\nthink it of greater importance, and make her more anxious to insinuate\r\nherself into her mistress’s favour, by divulging it.” The justness of\r\nthese reflections added to my embarrassment. Fortunately the fellow was\r\nin a talking mood; and as I had occasion for him, I let him go on:\r\nwhile relating his adventures with this girl, he informed me the room\r\nshe slept in was only separated from the apartment of her mistress by a\r\nsingle partition, and as the least noise would be heard, they met every\r\nnight in his room. I instantly formed my plan, which I communicated to\r\nhim, and we executed it successfully.\r\n\r\nI awaited until the clock struck two, and then, as was agreed, went to\r\nthe rendezvous, with a lighted candle in my hand, and under pretence of\r\nhaving several times in vain rung the bell. My confidant, who plays his\r\npart to admiration, performed a little scene of surprise, despair, and\r\nconfusion, which I put a stop to, by sending him to warm me some water,\r\nwhich I pretended to have occasion for; the scrupulous waiting-maid was\r\nthe more disconcerted, as the fellow, who had improved on my scheme,\r\nhad made her make a toilet very suitable to the heat of the season, but\r\nwhich it by no means apologised for.\r\n\r\nBeing sensible the more this girl was humbled, the less trouble I\r\nshould have to bring her to my designs, I did not suffer her to change\r\neither her situation or dress; and having ordered my servant to wait\r\nfor me in my room, I sat by her bed-side, which was in much disorder,\r\nand began a conversation. It was necessary to keep the ascendant I had\r\nobtained, and I therefore preserved a _sang froid_ that would have done\r\nhonour to the continence of Scipio; and without taking the smallest\r\nliberty with her, which her ruddy countenance, and the opportunity,\r\nperhaps, gave her a right to hope; I talked to her of business with as\r\nmuch indifference, as I would have done with an attorney.\r\n\r\nMy conditions were, that I would observe the strictest secrecy,\r\nprovided the day following, at the same hour, she put me in possession\r\nof her mistress’s pockets, and my offer of ten louis-d’ors. I now\r\nconfirm I will not take any advantage of your situation. Every thing\r\nwas granted, as you may believe; I then retired, and left the happy\r\ncouple to repair their lost time.\r\n\r\nI employed mine in sleep: and in the morning, wanting a pretence not\r\nto answer my fair one’s letter before I had examined her papers, which\r\ncould not be till the night following, I resolved to go a-hunting,\r\nwhich took up the greatest part of the day.\r\n\r\nAt my return I was received very coolly. I have reason to believe\r\nshe was a little piqued at my want of eagerness to make good use of\r\nthe time that remained, especially after the softer letter which she\r\nwrote me. I formed this conjecture, because, on Madame de Rosemonde’s\r\nhaving reproached me on my long absence, the fair one replied with some\r\nacrimony, “Oh, let us not reproach Mr. de Valmont for his attachment\r\nto the only pleasure he can find here.” I complained that they did not\r\ndo me justice, and took the opportunity to assure them I was so well\r\npleased with their company, that I sacrificed to it a very interesting\r\nletter that I had to write; adding, that not having been able to sleep\r\nseveral nights, I endeavoured to try if fatigue would not bring me my\r\nusual rest; my looks sufficiently explained the subject of my letter,\r\nand the cause of my want of rest. I took care to affect, during the\r\nwhole evening, a melancholy softness, which succeeded tolerably well,\r\nand under which I disguised my impatience for the hour which was to\r\ngive me up the secret she so obstinately persisted in concealing. At\r\nlength we retired; and soon after the faithful waiting-maid brought\r\nme the stipulated price of my discretion: when in possession of this\r\ntreasure, I proceeded with my usual prudence to arranging them; for it\r\nwas of the utmost importance to replace every thing in order.\r\n\r\nI first hit upon two letters from the husband, indigested stuff,\r\na mixture of uninteresting details of law-suits, and unmeaning\r\nprotestations of conjugal love, which I had the patience to read\r\nthrough; but not a syllable in either concerning me. I put them in\r\ntheir place with some disgust; but that vanished on finding, in my\r\nhand-writing, the scraps of my famous letter from Dijon, carefully\r\ncollected. Fortunately it came into my head to run them over. You may\r\nguess the excess of my raptures, when I distinctly perceived the traces\r\nof my adorable devotee’s tears. I must own I gave way to a puerile\r\nemotion, and kissed this letter with a transport that I did not think\r\nmyself susceptible of. I continued the happy search; I found all my\r\nletters in order according to their dates; and what still surprised me\r\nmore agreeably was, to find the first of them, that which I thought\r\nhad been returned to me by my ungrateful fair one, faithfully copied\r\nin her own hand-writing, but in an altered and trembling manner, which\r\nsufficiently testified the soft agitation of her heart during the time\r\nshe was employed at it.\r\n\r\nSo far I was entirely occupied with love; but soon gave way to the\r\ngreatest rage. Who think you it is that wants to destroy me, with\r\nthis woman I adore? What fury do you suppose wicked enough to form so\r\ndiabolical a plan! You know her: it’s your friend, your relation; it\r\nis Madame de Volanges. You cannot conceive what a string of horrible\r\nstories the infernal Megera has wrote against me. It is she, and\r\nshe alone, has disturbed the peace of this angelic woman; it is by\r\nher counsels, by her pernicious advice, that I find myself obliged\r\nto retire; I am sacrificed to her! Certainly her daughter shall be\r\nseduced; but that is not sufficient, she shall be ruined; and since the\r\nage of this accursed woman shelters her from my blows, I must strike at\r\nher in the object of her affections.\r\n\r\nShe will then force me to return to Paris; she obliges me to it! Be it\r\nso; I will return; but she shall have reason to lament my return. I am\r\nsorry Danceny is to be the hero of this adventure; he has a fund of\r\nhonour that will be a restraint upon us; but he is in love, and we are\r\noften together: I may turn him to account. My anger overcomes me, and I\r\nforget that I am to give you the recital of what has passed to-day.\r\n\r\nThis morning I saw my lovely prude; she never appeared so charming;\r\nthat was of course; it is the most powerful moment with a woman, that\r\nshall produce an intoxication of soul, which is so often spoke of, and\r\nso rarely felt, when, though certain of their affections, we have not\r\nyet possessed their favours; which is precisely my case. Perhaps the\r\nidea, also, of being deprived of the pleasure of seeing her, served to\r\nembellish her. At length the post arrived, and brought me your letter\r\nof the 27th; and whilst I was reading it, I hesitated whether I should\r\nkeep my word or not; but I met my fair one’s eyes, and I found it\r\nimpossible to refuse her any thing.\r\n\r\nI therefore announced my departure immediately after Madame de\r\nRosemonde left us: I was four paces distant from the austere lovely\r\none, when she started with a frightened air, “leave me, leave me, Sir,”\r\nsaid she; “for the love of God, leave me!” This fervent prayer, which\r\ndiscovered her emotion, animated me the more; I was now close to her,\r\nand took hold of her hands, which she had joined together with the most\r\nmoving, affecting expressiveness. I then began my tender complaints,\r\nwhen some evil genius brought back Madame de Rosemonde. The timid\r\ndevotee, who has in reality some reason to be apprehensive, seized the\r\nopportunity, and retired.\r\n\r\nI notwithstanding offered her my hand, which she accepted; and judging\r\nfavourably of this kindness, which she had not shown for so long a\r\ntime, and again renewing my complaints, I endeavoured to squeeze hers.\r\nShe at first endeavoured to draw it back; but upon a more pressing\r\ninstance, she gave it up with a good grace, although without either\r\nanswering this emotion or my discourse. Being come to the door of\r\nher apartment, I wanted to kiss that hand before I left her: she\r\nstruggled, but an _ah! think I am going to part_, pronounced with great\r\ntenderness, made her awkward and defenceless; the kiss was scarcely\r\ngiven, when the hand recovered its strength to escape, and the fair one\r\nentered her apartment where the waiting-maid was: here ends my tale.\r\n\r\nAs I presume you will be to-morrow at the Lady Marechale’s de ——,\r\nwhere, certainly, I shall not go to look for you; and as at our first\r\ninterview we shall have a great many things to talk over, especially\r\nthat of the little Volanges, which I do not lose sight of; I have\r\ndetermined to send this letter before me; and although it is so long,\r\nI will not close it until the moment I am going to send it to the\r\npost; for I am so circumstanced, that a great deal may depend on an\r\nopportunity; and I leave you to watch for it.\r\n\r\nP. S. Eight o’clock at night.\r\n\r\nNothing new; not the least moment of liberty; even the greatest care\r\nemployed to avoid it. Yet as much grief as decency would permit, for\r\nthe least another event, which may not be a matter of indifference, as\r\nMadame de Rosemonde has commanded me to give an invitation to Madame de\r\nVolanges, to come and spend a few days in the country.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my lovely friend, until to-morrow, or the day after at farthest!\r\n\r\n_Aug._ 28, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLV.\r\n\r\n_The_ Presidente de Tourvel _to_ Madame de Volanges.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. de Valmont is gone this morning, Madam: you seemed so anxiously\r\nto wish for this event, that I have thought it my duty to impart\r\nit to you. Madame de Rosemonde is inconsolable for the loss of her\r\nnephew, whose company was really very pleasing: she spent the whole\r\nmorning in talking to me of him with her usual sensibility; she was\r\ninexhaustible in his praise. I thought myself bound to attend to it\r\nwithout interruption; and indeed I must own she was right on many\r\nheads; besides, I was sensible I was the cause of this separation, and\r\nhave no prospect of making her amends for the pleasure of which I have\r\ndeprived her. You know I am not naturally inclined to gaiety, and our\r\nmanner of life here will not contribute much to increase it.\r\n\r\nHad I not been following your advice, I should have been inclined to\r\nthink I had acted too precipitately; for I was really hurt at the grief\r\nI had caused my respectable friend; I was so much moved, that I could\r\nhave mingled my tears with hers.\r\n\r\nWe now live on the hope that you will accept the invitation that\r\nMr. de Valmont will give you from Madame de Rosemonde, to come and\r\npass a little time with her. I hope you have no doubt of the great\r\nsatisfaction your compliance will give me; and indeed you should make\r\nus amends. I shall be happy in this opportunity of having the pleasure\r\nof being sooner acquainted with Mademoiselle de Volanges, and to be\r\nnear you, to assure you more and more of the respectful sentiments with\r\nwhich I am, &c.\r\n\r\n_Aug._ 29, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLVI.\r\n\r\n_The_ Chevalier Danceny _to_ Cecilia Volanges.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat then has happened to you, my adorable Cecilia! What can have\r\ncaused so sudden, so cruel a change in you? What are become of your\r\nvows of eternal constancy? Even yesterday you renewed them with so\r\nmuch pleasure: what! can to-day make you forget them? In vain do I\r\nexamine—I can’t find any reason given by myself; and it afflicts me\r\nmuch to have to seek the cause in you. Ah, no! you are neither fickle\r\nor deceitful; and even in this moment of despair, no unworthy suspicion\r\nshall disgrace my heart; and yet, from what fatality are you no longer\r\nthe same? No, cruel creature, you are not! The tender Cecilia, the\r\nCecilia I adore! whose constancy is pledged to me, would not have\r\nshunned my tender looks; would not have thwarted the happy accident\r\nthat placed me near her; or, if any reason that I can’t conceive, had\r\nforced her treat to me with so much rigour, she would at least have\r\ncondescended to have informed me of it.\r\n\r\nAh! you don’t know, you never can know, what you have made me suffer at\r\nthis day, what I shall suffer at this instant! Do you then think I can\r\nlive without your love? Yet, when I begged but a word, a single word,\r\nto dispel my fears, instead of making a reply, you feigned a dread of\r\nbeing overheard; and this obstacle, which then had no existence, you\r\ngave birth to by the place yon fixed on in the circle. When forced\r\nto leave you, and I asked what hour I should see you to-morrow, you\r\nfeigned not to know; and to Madame de Volanges was I obliged for\r\ntelling me. Thus the moment hitherto so much panted for, of being with\r\nyou to-morrow, will bring me only distress and grief; and the pleasure\r\nof seeing you, as yet the greatest my heart could experience, must now\r\ngive way to the dread of being troublesome.\r\n\r\nI already feel this: my fears prevent me from talking to you of my\r\npassion. Though _I love you_, that enchanting sound, which I so much\r\ndelighted in repeating, when I could hear it, in my turn; that sweet\r\nword which sufficed for my felicity, no longer offers me, if you\r\nare altered, but eternal despair. I cannot however think that this\r\ntalisman of love has lost all its effect, and I still strive to make\r\nuse of it. Yes, my Cecilia, _I love you_[1]. Repeat then this happy\r\nexpression with me. Remember you have accustomed me to it; and now to\r\ndeprive me of it, would be to condemn me to torments, which, like my\r\nlove, will only end with my life.\r\n\r\n_Aug._ 29, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Those who have not sometimes had occasion to feel the value of a\r\nword, of an expression consecrated by love, will not find any sense in\r\nthis phrase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLVII.\r\n\r\n_The_ Viscount de Valmont _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall not see you to-day, my charming friend; and I will give you my\r\nreasons, which I hope you will accept with your usual good nature.\r\n\r\nInstead of returning directly to town yesterday, I stopped at the\r\nCountess de ——’s, whose country seat was almost in my road; where\r\nI dined, and did not arrive in Paris till near seven o’clock, and\r\nalighted at the opera, where I thought you might be.\r\n\r\nWhen the opera was over, I went into the green room to see my old\r\nacquaintances; there I found my old friend Emily in the midst of a\r\nnumerous circle, male and female, who were engaged to sup with her that\r\nnight at P———. I no sooner came among them, but, by the unanimous\r\nvoice, I was entreated to be of the party. One, a short, thick figure,\r\nwho stammered out his invitation in Dutch French, I immediately\r\nrecognised to be the master of the feast. I yielded.\r\n\r\nI learned, on our way there, that the house we were going to was the\r\nprice agreed on for Emily’s condescension to this grotesque figure,\r\nand that this supper was in fact a wedding feast. The little man could\r\nnot contain himself for joy, in expectation of the happiness that\r\nawaited him; and I saw him so enraptured with it, that I felt a strong\r\ninclination to disturb it; which I effected.\r\n\r\nThe only difficulty was to bring Emily to consent, in whom the\r\nburgomaster’s riches had raised some scruples: however, after some\r\nsolicitation, I brought her at length to consent to my scheme, which\r\nwas, to fill this little beer hogshead with wine, and thus get rid of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe sublime idea we entertained of a drunken Dutchman, made us exert\r\nourselves. We succeeded so well, that by the time the dessert was\r\nbrought on the table, he was not able to hold his glass, whilst the\r\ntender Emily and I plied him incessantly, till, at length, he fell\r\nunder the table so drunk, that it must have lasted at least eight days.\r\nWe then determined to send him back to Paris; and as he had not kept\r\nhis carriage, I ordered him to be packed into mine, and I remained in\r\nhis room. I then received the compliments of the company, who retired\r\nsoon after, and left me master of the field of battle. This frolic, and\r\nperhaps my long retirement, made Emily so desirable, that I promised to\r\nremain with her until the resurrection of the Dutchman.\r\n\r\nThis condescension is a return for that she has just had for me, in\r\nsubmitting to serve me as a desk to write to my lovely devotee, to whom\r\nit struck me as a pleasant thought, to write in bed with, and almost in\r\nthe arms of, a girl, where I was interrupted by a complete infidelity.\r\nIn this letter I give her an exact account of my conduct and situation.\r\nEmily, who read the epistle, laughed immoderately, and I expect it will\r\nmake you laugh also.\r\n\r\nAs my letter must be marked at the Paris post-office, I leave it open\r\nfor you, enclosed. Read it, seal it, and send it there. But, pray, do\r\nnot use your own seal, nor even any amorous emblem—an antique head\r\nonly. Adieu, my lovely friend!\r\n\r\nP. S. I open my letter to acquaint you, I have determined Emily to go\r\nto the Italian opera; and will take that opportunity to visit you. I\r\nshall be with you at six the latest; and if agreeable to you, I will\r\naccompany you to Madame de Volanges’ at seven. It would not be decent\r\nto defer longer acquainting her with Madame de Rosemonde’s invitation;\r\nbesides, I shall be glad to see the little Volanges.\r\n\r\nAdieu, fair lady! I hope so much pleasure will attend my embracing you,\r\nthat the Chevalier may be jealous of it.\r\n\r\n_From P———, Aug._ 30, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\n_The_ Viscount de Valmont _to the_ Presidente de Tourvel.\r\n\r\n(_Post-mark, Paris_.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is after a very stormy night, during which I have not closed my\r\neyes; it is after having been in incessant agitations, both from\r\nuncommon ardour, and entire annihilation of all the faculties of my\r\nsoul, I come to you, madam, to seek the calm I so much stand in need\r\nof, and which I cannot yet hope to enjoy; for the situation I now\r\nwrite of, convinces me more than ever of the irresistible power of\r\nlove: I can hardly preserve command over myself, to arrange my ideas\r\nin any order; and I already foresee that I shall not be able to finish\r\nthis letter, without being obliged to break off. What! cannot I then\r\nhope that you will one day experience the emotions I do at this moment!\r\nI may venture, however, to assert, that if you thoroughly experienced\r\nsuch emotions, you could not be totally insensible to them. Believe\r\nme, Madam, settled tranquillity, the sleep of the soul, that image\r\nof death, does not lead to happiness; the active passions alone lead\r\nthe way; and notwithstanding the torments you make me suffer, I may,\r\nI think, assure myself, that I am this moment happier than you. In\r\nvain do you overwhelm me with your afflicting severities; they do not\r\nprevent me from giving a loose to my love, and forgetting, in the\r\ndelirium it causes me, the despair to which you abandon me: thus I\r\nrevenge myself of the exile to which you have condemned me. Never did\r\nI before experience so much pleasure in writing to you. Never did I\r\nfeel in this pleasing employment so sweet, so lively an emotion! Every\r\nthing conspires to raise my transports! The very air I breathe wafts me\r\nluxurious pleasure; even the table I write on, now, for the first time,\r\nconsecrated by me to that use, becomes to me a sacred altar of love;\r\nhow much more lustre will it not hence derive in my eyes! I will have\r\nengraven on it my oath ever to love you! Forgive, I beseech you, my\r\ndisordered senses. I ought, perhaps, to moderate transports you do not\r\nshare in. I must leave you a moment to dissipate a frenzy which I find\r\ngrowing upon me: I find it too strong for me.\r\n\r\nI return to you, Madam, and certainly return always with the same\r\neagerness; but the sentiment of happiness has fled from me, and gives\r\nplace to the most cruel state of privation. What does it avail me to\r\ntalk to you of my sentiments, if it is only in vain that I seek means\r\nof convincing you? After so many repeated efforts, my confidence and my\r\nstrength both abandon me at once. If I recall to my mind the pleasures\r\nof love, that only produces a more lively sense of regret at being\r\ndeprived of them. I see no resource but in your indulgence, and I too\r\nwell experience at this moment how much I want it, to hope to obtain\r\nit. Yet my passion was never more respectful, or ought to give you less\r\noffence: it is such, I can venture to say, as the strictest virtue\r\nwould have no reason to dread; but I am afraid any longer to take up\r\nyour time with the pains I experience, certain as I am that the object\r\nwho causes them, does not share them. I must not, at least, presume\r\ntoo far on goodness, which I should do by dwelling on this melancholy\r\npicture; I shall only implore you to give me a reply, and never to\r\ndoubt the veracity of my sentiments.\r\n\r\n_Wrote from P———, dated at Paris,_\r\n_Aug._ 30, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XLIX.\r\n\r\nCecilia Volanges _to the_ Chevalier Danceny.\r\n\r\n\r\nWithout being either fickle or deceitful, it is sufficient, Sir, to\r\naccount for my conduct, to know there is a necessity for an alteration\r\nin it: I have promised myself a sacrifice to God, until I can offer\r\nhim also the sacrifice of my sentiments for you, which the religious\r\nstate you are in renders doubly criminal.—I well know it will give\r\nme a great deal of uneasiness, and I will not conceal from you that,\r\nsince the day before yesterday, I have continually wept when I thought\r\non you; but I hope God will grant me the necessary strength to forget\r\nyou, which I constantly beg of him night and morning. I even expect,\r\nfrom your friendship and good breeding, that you will not endeavour to\r\ninterfere with me in the good resolutions that I have been inspired\r\nwith; and which I endeavour to cherish. I therefore request that you\r\nwill not write to me any more, as I assure you I shall give no answer;\r\nand it would oblige me to acquaint my mamma of every thing that\r\nhappens, which would entirely deprive me the pleasure of seeing you.\r\n\r\nI shall, notwithstanding, have all the attachment for you, that one\r\ncan have, consistently with innocence; and from my soul I wish you\r\nall manner of happiness. I know very well you will love me no longer,\r\nand, perhaps, you will soon love another better than me; but this will\r\nbe an additional penance for the fault I committed in giving you my\r\nheart, which I ought to have reserved for God and my husband, when I\r\nshall have one. I hope the divine mercy will pity my weakness, and not\r\nafflict me with misfortunes that I shall not be able to bear.\r\n\r\nFarewell, Sir! I can assure you, that if it was lawful for me to love\r\nany one, I should never love any but you; but that is all I can say,\r\nand perhaps more than I ought.\r\n\r\n_Aug._ 31, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER L.\r\n\r\n_The_ Presidente de Tourvel _to the_ Viscount de Valmont.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it thus, then, Sir, you fulfil the conditions on which I consented\r\nto receive your letters sometimes? And have I not reason to complain,\r\nwhen you mention a sentiment which I should dread to harbour, even were\r\nit not inconsistent with every idea of my duty.\r\n\r\nIf there was a necessity of fresh arguments to preserve this salutary\r\nfear, I think I may find sufficient in your last letter; for really, at\r\nthe time you think to apologise for your passion, you, on the contrary,\r\nconvince me of its multiplied horrors, for who would wish to purchase\r\npleasure at the expence of reason? Pleasures so transitory, and that\r\nare always followed by regret, and often by remorse.\r\n\r\nEven yourself, in whom the habitude of this dangerous delirium ought\r\nto diminish the effect, are notwithstanding obliged to agree, that it\r\noften becomes too strong for you, and you are the first to complain of\r\nthe involuntary disturbance it causes in you. What horrible ravages\r\nwould it not then make in an unexperienced and sensible heart, which\r\nwould augment its force by the greatness of the sacrifices it would be\r\nobliged to make?\r\n\r\nYou believe, or feign to believe, Sir, that love leads to happiness;\r\nbut I am fully persuaded that it would make me so totally miserable,\r\nthat I wish never to hear the word mentioned. I think that even\r\nspeaking of it hurts tranquillity; and it is as much from inclination\r\nas duty, that I beseech you to be hereafter silent on that subject:\r\nthis requisition you may very easily grant at this time. You are now\r\nreturned to Paris, where you will find opportunities enough to forget\r\na sentiment which probably owed its birth to the habit you have of\r\nmaking this your whole employment; and the strength of your present\r\npassion, is probably to be ascribed to your want of other objects in\r\nthe country. Are you not now in that place where you often saw me with\r\nindifference? Can you take a step there without meeting an example of\r\nyour mutability? Are you not there surrounded by women, who, all more\r\namiable than me, have a greater right to your homage? I have not the\r\nvanity with which my sex is reproached; I have still less of that false\r\nmodesty, which is nothing less than a refinement of pride; and it is\r\nwith sincerity I assure you, that I am not conscious of possessing\r\nattractions: had I the greatest, I should not think them sufficient to\r\nfix you. To request of you, then, to think no more of me is only to beg\r\nof you to do now what you did before, and what you certainly would do\r\nin a very short time, were I even to make a contrary request.\r\n\r\nThis truth, which I do not lose sight of, would be alone a sufficient\r\nreason to listen to you no longer. I have a thousand other reasons; but\r\nwithout entering into long discussion, I shall once more entreat, as I\r\nhave already done, that you will not write to me more upon a sentiment\r\nto which I ought not to listen, much less make any return.\r\n\r\n_Sept._ 1, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF THE FIRST VOLUME.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDANGEROUS\r\nCONNECTIONS:\r\n\r\nA SERIES OF\r\nLETTERS,\r\nSELECTED FROM THE CORRESPONDENCE\r\nOF\r\nA PRIVATE CIRCLE;\r\nAND PUBLISHED FOR THE INSTRUCTION\r\nOF SOCIETY.\r\n\r\nBY M.

EBERS, OLD BOND STREET.\r\n1812\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LI.\r\n\r\n_The_ Marchioness de Merteuil _to_ Viscount Valmont.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon my word, Viscount, you are intolerable; you treat me with as\r\nlittle ceremony as if I was your mistress. Do you know you will make me\r\nangry, and that I am this instant in a most horrible passion? so you\r\nare to meet Danceny to-morrow morning? you know how important it is I\r\nshould see you before that interview; yet, without giving yourself any\r\nfarther trouble, you make me wait the whole day, while you run about I\r\nknow not where. You are the cause of my having been _indecently_ late\r\nat Madame de Volanges’, which all the old women thought _exceedingly\r\nstrange;_ I was under the necessity of amusing them the rest of the\r\nevening, to keep them in temper; for one must be on good terms with old\r\nwomen; they decide on the reputation of the young ones.\r\n\r\nNow it is one o’clock; and instead of going to bed as I ought, I must\r\nsit up to write you a long letter, which will add to my drowsiness\r\nby its disagreeable subject. You are very lucky that I have not time\r\nto scold you. Do not imagine, however, I forgive you: you have only\r\nto thank my hurry. Hear me, then: with a little address, you may,\r\nto-morrow, obtain Danceny’s confidence. The opportunity is favourable:\r\nit is that of distress. The little girl has been at confession, has\r\ntold all like a child, and has been since so terrified with the fear of\r\nhell, that she is absolutely determined on a rupture. She related to\r\nme all her little scruples in a manner that I am confident her head is\r\nturned. She showed me that letter, declaring her breaking off, which is\r\nin the true style of fanatical absurdity. She prattled for an hour to\r\nme without a word of common sense, and yet she embarrassed me; for you\r\nwill conceive I could not risk to open my mind to such an idiot.\r\n\r\nI observe, however, amidst all this nonsense, that she is not the less\r\nin love with her Danceny; I even took notice of one of those resources\r\nwhich love always supplies, and to which the girl is curiously enough a\r\ndupe. Tormented with the thoughts of her lover, and the fear of being\r\ndamned for those thoughts, she has taken it into her head to pray to\r\nGod to make her forget him; and as she renews this prayer every hour in\r\nthe day, she is thus incessantly thinking of him.\r\n\r\nTo any one more _formed_ than Danceny, this little circumstance would\r\nbe more favourable than impropitious; but the youth is such a Celadon,\r\nthat unless we assist him, it will take him so much time to conquer the\r\nslightest obstacles, that we shall not have time enough to carry our\r\nproject into effect.\r\n\r\nYou are quite right, it is a pity, and I am as sorry as you that he\r\nshould be the hero of this adventure; but what can be done? What is\r\npast is not to be recalled, and it’s all your fault. I desired to see\r\nhis answer; it was wretched stuff. He gives her numberless reasons to\r\nprove that an involuntary passion is not criminal; as if it became\r\ninvoluntary in the moment of desiring to resist it. This idea is so\r\nsimple, that it even struck the girl herself. He laments his misfortune\r\nin a manner somewhat pathetic; but his grief is so cold, and yet bears\r\nthe appearance of being so fixed and sincere, I think it impossible\r\nthat a woman, who has an opportunity of driving a man to despair with\r\nso small a risk, should not gratify the whim. He informs her he is not\r\na monk, as the little one imagined; and that is certainly the best\r\npart of his letter: for, were a woman absurd enough to be seized with\r\na propensity to monastic love, the gentlemen who are Knights of Malta\r\nwould not deserve the preference.\r\n\r\nHowever, instead of throwing away time in arguments which would have\r\ncommitted me, and perhaps without persuasion, I approved the scheme of\r\nbreaking off; but told her in such cases it was more genteel to declare\r\nthe reasons in conversation, than write them; that it was also usual to\r\nreturn the letters and other trifles that might have been received; and\r\nthus seeming to enter into her views, I determined her to give Danceny\r\na meeting. We immediately concluded the method of bringing it about;\r\nand I undertook to prevail upon her mother to go on a visit without\r\nher; and to-morrow evening is the decisive hour of our meeting. Danceny\r\nis apprised of it. For God’s sake, if you possibly can, prevail on\r\nthis lovely swain to be less languid; and tell him, since he must be\r\ntold every thing, that the true method of overcoming scruples, is to\r\nleave nothing to lose, to those who are subject to scruples: that this\r\nridiculous scene may not be renewed, I did not omit raising doubts in\r\nher mind, on the discretion of confessors; and I assure you she repays\r\nme the fright she put me into, by her present apprehensions, lest her\r\nconfessor should tell her mother all. I hope, after I have had one\r\nor two more conferences with her on this subject, she will not be so\r\nridiculous to tell her foolish nonsense to the first comer[1].\r\n\r\nAdieu, Viscount! Seize on Danceny, give him his lesson; it would be\r\nshameful we should not do as we pleased with two children. If we meet\r\nmore difficulty than we first imagined in this business, let us reflect\r\nto animate our zeal; you, that your object is Madame de Volanges’\r\ndaughter; and I, that she is intended to be Gercourt’s bride. Adieu!\r\n\r\n_Sept_. 2, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The reader must have long since observed, from Madame de Merteuil’s\r\nmanners, that she paid little regard to religion. All this detail would\r\nhave been suppressed; but it was thought, that to show effects, it was\r\nnecessary to touch upon the causes of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LII.\r\n\r\nViscount de Valmont _to the_ Presidente de Tourvel.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou forbid me, Madam, to talk to you of my love: but where shall I\r\nfind courage to obey you? Entirely engrossed by a passion, which\r\nought to be of an agreeable nature, and which your obduracy renders\r\nso tormenting; languishing in the exile to which you have condemned\r\nme; existing only in a state of privation and sorrow, a prey to the\r\nmost cruel reflections, which incessantly recall to my mind your\r\nindifference; must I then lose my only remaining consolation? Can I\r\nhave any other, than sometimes to bare to you a heart overwhelmed by\r\nyou with anguish and bitterness? Will you turn aside, not to see the\r\ntears you cause to flow? Will you refuse even the acknowledgment of the\r\nsacrifices you require? Would it not then be more consonant to your\r\nsoft tender disposition, to pity a wretch you have made miserable, than\r\nto aggravate his sorrows by a prohibition equally unjust and rigorous?\r\n\r\nYou affect to fear the passion of love, and yet you will not see that\r\nyou alone cause the evils you reproach to it. Most indubitably it\r\nmust be a painful sensation when the object that inspires it does not\r\nparticipate in it: but where is happiness to be found, if reciprocal\r\nlove does not produce it? A tender friendship, a sweet confidence,\r\nthat confidence which is the only untinctured with reserve, care\r\nsoftened, pleasure augmented, enchanting hopes, delicious reflections;\r\nwhere are they to be found but in love? You calumniate it, who to share\r\nall its blessings have only to cherish it; and I, forgetful of the\r\ntorments it causes, am only anxious to defend it. You oblige me also\r\nto defend myself: for whilst I devote my life to adore you, yours is\r\nemployed in searching out new faults in me. Already do you suppose me\r\nvolatile and deceitful; and taking advantage of a few trivial errors\r\nwhich I ingenuously confessed, you are pleased to confound what I\r\nthen was, with what I now am. Not satisfied with having delivered me\r\nup to the torments of living at a distance from you, you add to it a\r\ncruel mockery of pleasures to which you have made me too sensible. You\r\nneither credit my promises nor oaths. Well! there is one pledge yet\r\nleft me to offer, of which you can have no doubt; I mean yourself. I\r\nonly beg of you to ask yourself with sincerity, if you don’t believe\r\nI love you sincerely? Whether you have the least doubt of your empire\r\nover my heart? Whether you are not even certain of having fixed this,\r\nas yet, I most own, too inconstant heart? I will consent to suffer for\r\nthis error. I shall lament, but shall not appeal. If, on the other\r\nhand, and just to us both, you should be obliged to acknowledge, that\r\nyou now have not, nor ever will have, a rival, do not oblige me to\r\ncombat chimeras. Leave me, at least, the consolation to believe, you no\r\nlonger doubt a sentiment which never will, never can end but with my\r\nlife. Permit me, Madam, to beseech you to answer positively this part\r\nof my letter.\r\n\r\nShould I even give up that epoch of my life, which, it seems, has hurt\r\nme so much in your opinion, it is not that I want reasons to defend\r\nit: for, after all, what is my crime? Why, not to be able to resist\r\nthe torrent in which I was plunged, launched into the world young and\r\ninexperienced. Bandied, as it were, from one to another, by a number\r\nof women, who all hastened, by their facility, to prevent a reflection\r\nthat they knew would be unfavourable to them, was it for me to set the\r\nexample of a resistance that was not opposed to me? Or should I have\r\npunished myself for a momentary error by an useless constancy, which\r\nwould only have exposed me to ridicule? And what other method but a\r\nspeedy rupture can justify a shameful choice?\r\n\r\nBut I can truly say, that this intoxication of the senses, or, perhaps,\r\nthis delirium of vanity, never reached my heart. Born, as it were, for\r\nlove, intrigue could only distract it; but was not sufficient to take\r\npossession of it. Surrounded by seducing, but despicable objects, none\r\nwent to my soul. Pleasures offered, but I sought virtues; and I even\r\nthought myself inconstant, because I was delicate, and had feelings.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw you, I began to be enlightened. I soon perceived that the\r\ncharms of love were attached to the qualities of the soul; that they\r\nalone could produce an excess and justification of love. I instantly\r\nfelt, that it would be as impossible not to love you, as it would be to\r\nlove any other but you.\r\n\r\nSuch, Madam, is the heart which you dread to yield to, and whose fate\r\nyou are to determine: but be it as it will, you will never be able to\r\nalter the sentiments that attached it to you; they are as unalterable\r\nas the virtues which gave them birth.\r\n\r\n_Sept._ 3, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LIII.\r\n\r\nViscount de Valmont _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nI saw Danceny, and only obtained a half-confidence from him; he is\r\ntenacious in concealing the name of the little Volanges, and spoke of\r\nher as of a very discreet person, and something inclined to devotion.\r\nAs to the rest, he related his adventure with tolerable propriety,\r\nespecially the last event. I heated his imagination as much as I could,\r\nand ridiculed his scrupulous delicacy; but he is still the same, and I\r\ncannot depend upon him: I shall be able to tell you more of him after\r\nto-morrow. We go to-morrow to Versailles, and shall endeavour to dive\r\ninto him by the way.\r\n\r\nThe interview that was to take place to-day gives me some hopes:\r\nperhaps every thing succeeded to our wishes; and perhaps nothing now\r\nremains but to extract the confession, and gather the proofs. This\r\nbusiness will be easier for you to perform than me, for the little\r\nthing is more open, or, which is the same thing, more silly then her\r\ndiscreet lover; notwithstanding, I’ll do my best.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my lovely friend! I have a great deal of employment on my hands.\r\nI will neither see you this night nor to-morrow: but if you come to\r\nthe knowledge of any thing, let me have a line at my return. I shall\r\ncertainly sleep in Paris.\r\n\r\n_Sept._ 3, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LIV.\r\n\r\n_The_ Marchioness de Merteuil _to the_ Viscount de Valmont.\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, to be sure, Danceny is a very proper person to get any thing out\r\nof. If he has said any thing to you, he is a braggart. I do not know\r\nsuch a fool in love matters, and I reproach myself more and more for\r\nthe pains we take for him. Do you know, I had like to be exposed on his\r\naccount, and for no purpose whatever? Oh! I shall be revenged, I assure\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWhen I called yesterday on Madame de Volanges, she had altered her\r\nmind; she would not go out; she said she was indisposed, and I was\r\nforced to make use of all my eloquence to bring her to a resolution;\r\nand the moment was drawing near that Danceny would have arrived before\r\nwe set out; which would have been so much the more awkward, as Madame\r\nde Volanges had told him the evening before, she would not be at home:\r\nher daughter and I were upon thorns.\r\n\r\nAt length we set out; and the little thing squeezed my hand so\r\naffectionately, bidding me adieu, that in spite of her project for a\r\nrupture, which she was seriously engaged in, I prognosticated wonders\r\nfrom the evening’s amusement.\r\n\r\nBut my uneasiness was not to end thus. We were scarcely half an hour\r\nat Madame de ——’s, when Madame de Volanges was really taken ill,\r\nand wanted to return home: but I, who was afraid that we should\r\nsurprise the young people, as there was every reason to dread, took the\r\nresolution to alarm her on the score of her health, which fortunately\r\nis not very difficult, and detained her an hour and a half without\r\nconsenting to bring her back, lest the motion of the carriage should be\r\nprejudicial to her. At length we returned at the hour agreed on. By the\r\nbashful look I observed at our arrival, I own I thought that, at least,\r\nour labour was not lost.\r\n\r\nThe strong inclination that I had to be satisfied, made me remain with\r\nMadame de Volanges, who immediately went to bed; and after having\r\nsupped by her bedside, we came away soon, in order to leave her to her\r\nrepose, and went into her daughter’s apartment. She, on her part, did\r\nevery thing I expected from her; scruples fled, new oaths of constancy,\r\n&c. &c. but that blockhead Danceny did not advance a step farther than\r\nhe was before. One can quarrel with him safely, for the reconciliation\r\nwould not be difficult; the little thing, however, says, that he\r\nwanted farther advantages, but she knew how to defend herself: I would\r\nventure, however, to lay a wager, that she brags, or, at least, excuses\r\nhim, and I am even almost certain of it. I took it into my head, to\r\nknow what defence she was capable of making; and from question to\r\nquestion, I warmed her imagination to such a degree—in short, you may\r\nbelieve me, there never was a person more susceptible of a sensitive\r\nsurprise than she is. This little dear creature is truly amiable; she\r\ndeserves a better lover; she, at least, shall have a good friend, for I\r\nam most sincerely attached to her. I have promised to model her, and I\r\nbelieve I’ll keep my word. I have often perceived the want of a female\r\nconfident, and I would rather have her than any other; but I can’t make\r\nany thing of her, until she is—what she must be; that is one more\r\nreason for being angry with Danceny.\r\n\r\nFarewell, Viscount; do not come to my house to-morrow, unless it be\r\nin the morning. I have acquiesced to the pressing invitations of the\r\nChevalier for a night at the villa.\r\n\r\n_Sept._ 4, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LV.\r\n\r\nCecilia Volanges _to_ Sophia Carnay.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou were in the right, my dear Sophy; thy prophesies are more\r\nsuccessful than thy advice. Danceny, as you predicted, has been\r\nstronger than my confessor, than you, or even myself; we are just as\r\nwe were before. I am not sorry for it; and if thou art, and that you\r\nscorn me, it is because you are a stranger to the pleasure I have in\r\nloving Danceny. It is easy to lay down rules how we should act; but if\r\nyou had ever experienced the distress we feel for those we love, how we\r\nparticipate in his joys, how difficult it is to say no, when we wish to\r\nsay yes, you would no longer be astonished: I who have already sensibly\r\nfelt it, cannot as yet conceive it. Now, can you believe that I can see\r\nDanceny cry, without crying myself? That, I assure you, is impossible;\r\nand when he is pleased, I am happy; it is in vain to talk about it;\r\nwhat is, must be, and I am sure it is so.\r\n\r\nI wish you were in my room;—but that is not what I mean to say; for\r\ncertainly I would not give place to any one: but I wish you were in\r\nlove with somebody; it is not only that you should understand me\r\nbetter, but that you should have less reason to find fault; but also\r\nthat you should be happier, or, rather, that you should begin to taste\r\nof happiness.\r\n\r\nOur amusements, our trifles, and all that, is folly; but in love, a\r\nword, a look only, is the summit of happiness. When I see Danceny, I\r\nwish for nothing more: when he is from me, I wish for nothing but him.\r\nI cannot account for it: but I imagine that every thing that pleases\r\nme, bears a resemblance to him. When he is absent from me, I dream of\r\nhim; and when I can think of him without being disturbed, that is, when\r\nI am alone, I am happy. When I close my eyes, I think I see him; I\r\nrecall his conversation, and I think I hear him speak; then I sigh—I\r\nfeel myself agitated in a strange manner—it is a kind of sensation; I\r\ndon’t know what to call it; but it is inexpressibly delightful.\r\n\r\nI am apt to think, that when one is in love, it diffuses itself to\r\nour friendship: that I have for thee, has never altered; it is always\r\nthe same as it was at the convent; but that I experience with Madame\r\nde Merteuil, is more like the affection I have for Danceny than that I\r\nhave for thee; and I sometimes wish she was a man; that is, perhaps,\r\nbecause it is not a childish friendship like ours; or else, that I see\r\nthem so often together. But this I am sure of, between them both they\r\nmake me very happy. After all, I don’t think there is any great harm in\r\nwhat I do. I wish I was to remain as I am; for there is nothing gives\r\nme uneasiness but the thoughts of my marriage. And if Mr. de Gercourt\r\nis so disagreeable as he is described to me, which I have no doubt of,\r\nI don’t know what will become of me. Adieu, my dear Sophy; I love thee\r\nmost affectionately.\r\n\r\n_Sept._ 4, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LVI.\r\n\r\n_The_ Presidente de Tourvel _to the_ Viscount de Valmont.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat purpose would it answer, Sir, to give a reply to your request? For\r\nto agree with your opinions would be a stronger motive to beware of\r\nthem; and without either attacking or defending their sincerity, it is\r\nenough for me, and ought to be so for you also, to know, that I neither\r\nought or will answer them.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose for a moment, that you may have a sincere affection\r\nfor me, (and it is only that we may have done with this subject, that\r\nI admit this supposition), would the obstacles that separate us be\r\nthe less insurmountable; and ought not my wishes to be still the\r\nsame, that you should overcome this passion, and every effort of mine\r\nemployed to assist you, by hastening to deprive you of all manner\r\nof hope? You agree that this _idea must hurt, when the object that\r\ninspires it does not share it_. You are sufficiently convinced that\r\nit is impossible for me to share it; and if even I experienced such a\r\nmisfortune, I should be the more to be pitied, without adding in the\r\nleast to your happiness. I hope I have such a share in your esteem,\r\nthat you will not call what I now say in question. Cease, then, I\r\nconjure you, cease to disturb a heart to which tranquillity is so\r\nnecessary; do not oblige me to regret my acquaintance with you.\r\n\r\nBeloved and esteemed by a husband, who I love and respect, my duty and\r\npleasure are united in the same object; I am happy; I ought to be so.\r\nIf there are more lively pleasures existing, I wish them not; I will\r\nnot be acquainted with them. Can any be so pleasing as to be at peace\r\nwith oneself, to enjoy days of serenity, to sleep without disturbance,\r\nand to awake without remorse? What you call happiness, is the tumult\r\nof the senses, the storm of passions, the aspect of which is dreadful,\r\neven viewing it from the shore; and who then would encounter such\r\nstorms? Who would dare embark upon a sea spread with thousands and\r\nthousands of wrecks, and with whom? No, Sir, I will remain upon land; I\r\ncherish the links with which I am attached; I would not break them if I\r\ncould; and if even I was not bound, I would speedily wear them.\r\n\r\nWhy do you pursue my steps? Why do you obstinately follow me? Your\r\nletters, which were to be but seldom, succeed each other with\r\nrapidity; they were to be discreet, and you entertain me with nothing\r\nbut your mad passion. You surround me with your ideas, more than you\r\ndid with your person; put away under one form, you again appear under\r\nanother. The things I desire you to be silent upon, you say over again\r\nin another manner. You take a pleasure in perplexing me, by captious\r\nreasons, and you evade mine. I will not reply to you any more:—how\r\nyou treat the women you have seduced! how contemptibly do you speak\r\nof them! I will readily believe some of them deserve it; but are they\r\nall then so contemptible? Ah, doubtless they are, since they have\r\nrelinquished virtue, to give themselves up to a criminal passion;\r\nin that moment they lost all, even the esteem of him to whom they\r\nsacrificed every thing! This punishment is just; but the idea alone is\r\nenough to make one shudder; but what is all this to me? Why should I\r\ntrouble myself about you or them; what right have you to disturb my\r\npeace? Leave me. See me no more; write me no more, I beseech you; I\r\neven require it. This letter shall be the last you will ever receive\r\nfrom me.\r\n\r\n_Sept._ 5, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LVII.\r\n\r\nViscount de Valmont _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nI received your letter yesterday at my return. Your anger is\r\nenchanting. You could not have felt Danceny’s errors in a more lively\r\nmanner, if they had even affected yourself. It is undoubtedly for\r\nthe sake of revenge, that you accustom his mistress to commit little\r\ninfidelities: you are a mischievous creature. How delightful you are!\r\nand I am not astonished that one can resist you less than Danceny. At\r\nlength I have gained the confidence of this hero of romance. He has\r\nno longer any secrets with me. I much extolled the supreme happiness\r\nattendant on an honourable passion; proved that one such passion\r\nwas infinitely superior to ten intrigues; and that even I am but a\r\ntimid lover. He was so pleased with this way of thinking, it being\r\nso conformable to his own, and enchanted with my candour, that he\r\npoured out his whole soul, and vowed an everlasting friendship without\r\nreserve; however, our project is not more advanced.\r\n\r\nAt first he seemed of opinion, that a young lady should be treated more\r\ncautiously than a woman, as having more to lose. He is particularly\r\npersuaded, that a man is unjustifiable, who reduces a girl to the\r\nnecessity of marrying him, or living dishonoured, when the girl is\r\nin much more affluent circumstances than the man, as is his present\r\ncase. The mother’s confidences, the daughter’s candour; every thing\r\nintimidates and restrains him. The difficulty lies not in overruling\r\nhis arguments, however just. With the assistance of his passion, and\r\na little address, they might soon be overturned, being so open to\r\nridicule, and so opposite to fashion. But the obstacle to this having\r\nthe effect upon him is, that he thinks himself happy as he is. First\r\namours appear, in general, more honourable, or, as it is called, more\r\nchaste, because they are slower, and not, as is imagined, from delicacy\r\nor timidity: in those, the heart, astonished by an insensible instinct,\r\nstops, as it were, to enjoy the delight it feels; and this powerful\r\ndelight takes such strong possession of a young mind, as absorbs it,\r\nand renders it callous to every other kind of enjoyment. This axiom\r\nis so true, that a libertine when in love, if such a being exists,\r\nbecomes from that moment less anxious of enjoyment; and to sum up all,\r\nbetween the behaviour of Danceny and the little Volanges, and mine\r\nwith the prude, Madame de Tourvel, the difference is only in degree.\r\nA few well-timed obstacles thrown in the young man’s way, might have\r\nbeen serviceable; for obstacles, accompanied with mystery, have a\r\nwonderful effect in inspiring boldness. I am apprehensive you have hurt\r\nour scheme by being too useful to him; your conduct would have been\r\nexcellent with an experienced _man_, who had no view beyond desire: but\r\nyou might have foreseen, that a youth of honourable dispositions, and\r\nimmersed in love, the greatest value of favours, is to be proof against\r\nlove; and consequently, the more certain he might be of being beloved,\r\nthe less enterprising he would be. What is to do now, I know not; but I\r\nam of opinion, the girl cannot be caught before marriage, and that our\r\nlabour will be lost. I am very sorry for it, but there is no remedy.\r\n\r\nWhilst I am writing a dissertation on this business, you are better\r\nemployed with your Chevalier. That recalls to my memory your promise to\r\ncommit an infidelity in my favour; I have it in writing, and I don’t\r\nintend it should be waste paper. I will allow, the time of payment is\r\nnot expired: it would be a generous act in you not to wait the day\r\nfixed for discharging it; on my part, I would acknowledge myself your\r\ndebtor for the interest. What say you, my lovely friend; are not you\r\ntired of your constancy? This Chevalier is a wonderful fellow, it\r\nseems. But I am determined to compel you to acknowledge, that if you\r\nfound any merit in him, it arose from your having forgot me.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear friend! I embrace you as ardently as I desire to possess\r\nyou. I defy all the Chevalier’s embraces to attain to an equal degree\r\nof ardour.\r\n\r\n_Sept._ 5, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LVIII.\r\n\r\nViscount de Valmont _to the_ Presidente de Tourvel.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is it I deserved the reproaches you make me, and the indignation\r\nyou express against me? The most violent, and yet the most respectful\r\nattachment, the most absolute submission to your will, is, in a few\r\nwords, the history of my conduct and sentiments towards you. Sinking\r\nunder the weight of an unhappy passion, the only consolation left was\r\nto see you; you ordered me to depart, and I obeyed without murmuring.\r\nFor this sacrifice you permitted me to write to you, and now I am to be\r\ndeprived of this only satisfaction. But shall I then have it torn from\r\nme without a struggle? No, certainly; it is too dear: it is the only\r\none that remains, and I hold it from you.\r\n\r\nYou say my letters are too frequent. I beg you will reflect, that for\r\nthese ten days that I have been exiled from you, a single moment has\r\nnot passed that was not taken up in thinking of you, and yet I have\r\nwrote you but two letters. _I entertain you with nothing but my mad\r\npassion._ Ah! what can I say but what I think? All I could do, was to\r\nsoften the expression; and I hope you will believe me when I assure\r\nyou, I have only let you see what I could not hide. At length you\r\nthreaten to answer me no more. And thus the man who prefers you to\r\nevery thing, and whose respect is still greater than his love, you are\r\nnot content to treat with the utmost severity, but add to it contempt.\r\nBut why all those threats and this wrath? What occasion for them, when\r\nyou are certain to be obeyed, even in your unjust orders? Is it then\r\npossible for me to contradict your wishes; and have I not already\r\nproved it? But will you abuse your power over me? After having made\r\nme miserable, after all your injustice, will it be an easy matter for\r\nyou to enjoy that tranquillity that you say is so necessary to you?\r\nWill you never tell yourself—he made me arbitress of his fate, and I\r\nmade him miserable; he implored my aid, and I did not even give him a\r\ncompassionate glance—Do you know how far despair may drive me? No.\r\n\r\nTo sooth my cares, you should know the extent of my passion, and you do\r\nnot know my heart.\r\n\r\nBut to what am I made a sacrifice? To chimerical fears. Who inspired\r\nthem? The man who adores you; a man over whom you will ever have an\r\nabsolute sway. What do you dread, what can you dread, from a sentiment\r\nthat you will always have the power to direct at your pleasure? Your\r\nimagination creates monsters, and the fears they raise you attribute to\r\nlove. With a little confidence those fears will vanish.\r\n\r\nA learned writer has said, that in order to dispel one’s fears, it\r\nwould be almost always sufficient to search the cause[1]. It is to\r\nlove, above all others, that this truth is applicable. Love and your\r\napprehensions will subside. In the room of terrifying objects, you\r\nwill find a tender submissive lover, and a delicious sentiment; your\r\ndays will be marked with bliss; and the only regret you will have,\r\nwill be to have lost so much time in indifference. Myself even, since\r\nI have abandoned my errors, exist no longer but for love. I regret the\r\ntime spent in pleasure; and I feel it is from you alone my happiness\r\nmust proceed. But let me entreat you, that the pleasure I have in\r\nwriting to you may not be interrupted by the dread of offending. I will\r\nnot disobey you; but lay myself at your feet, and there reclaim the\r\nhappiness you want to deprive me of; the only one that is left me. I\r\ncall on you; hear my prayers, and behold my tears. Ah, Madam! will you\r\nrefuse me?\r\n\r\n_Sept._ 7, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] It is imagined Rousseau in his Emily; but the citation is not\r\nexact, and the application that Valmont makes is false; and, perhaps,\r\nMadame de Tourvel had not read Emily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LIX.\r\n\r\nViscount de Valmont _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nPray inform me, if you can, what is all this nonsense of Danceny.\r\nWhat has happened, and what has he lost? His fair one, perhaps, is\r\nangry at his constant respect; and really one would be vexed at a\r\nsmaller matter. What shall I say to him to-night at the rendezvous\r\nhe requested, and which I have given him at all events. I shall most\r\ncertainly lose my time to attend his doleful ditty, if it does not\r\nlead us to something. Passionate complaints are supportable only in a\r\nrecitative obligato, or in grand airs. Give me your directions then\r\nabout this business, and what I am to do; otherwise I shall desert, to\r\navoid the dulness I foresee. Could I have a little chat with you this\r\nmorning? If you are _busy_, at least give me a line, and the catchword\r\nfor the part I am to act.\r\n\r\nWhere was you yesterday? I can never now have the pleasure of seeing\r\nyou. At this rate, it was not worth while to keep me in Paris in the\r\nmonth of September. Take some resolution, however; for I have just\r\nreceived a most pressing invitation from the Countess de B——, to\r\ngo see her in the country; and she writes very humorously, “that her\r\nhusband has the finest wood in the world, which he preserves carefully\r\nfor the amusement of his friends;” and you know I have some kind of\r\nright to that wood. I will go see it again, if you have no employment\r\nfor me. Adieu! Remember Danceny is to be with me at four o’clock.\r\n\r\n_Sept._ 8, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LX.\r\n\r\nChevalier Danceny _to the_ Viscount de Valmont.\r\n\r\n(_Enclosed in the preceding._)\r\n\r\n\r\nAh, Sir! I am in a state of desperation; all is lost. I dare not\r\nconfide to paper the cause of my troubles; but want to pour them forth\r\nin the bosom of some faithful friend. At what hour can I see you, to\r\nseek consolation and advice from you? I was so happy the day I opened\r\nmy mind to you; now, what an alteration! every thing is adverse to me.\r\nWhat I suffer upon my own account is the least part of my torments; my\r\nuneasiness for a much dearer object is what I cannot support. You, who\r\nare happier than me, can see her; and I expect from your friendship\r\nthat you will not refuse me: but I must speak to you, and give you your\r\ninstructions. I know you will pity and assist me. In you my hopes are\r\ncentered. You are sensible; you know what love is, and you are the only\r\none in whom I can confide: do not refuse me your assistance.\r\n\r\nAdieu, Sir! the only relief I experience in my sorrow, is to think I\r\nhave still such a friend as you left. Pray inform me, at what hour I\r\ncan find you at home; if it is not this morning, I beg it may be early\r\nin the afternoon.\r\n\r\n_Sept._ 8, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXI.\r\n\r\nCecilia Volanges _to_ Sophia Carnay.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear Sophy, pity thy poor Cecilia; she is very unhappy. Mamma knows\r\nall. I cannot conceive how she had any suspicion; and yet she has\r\ndiscovered every thing. Last night mamma appeared to be a little out\r\nof temper; but I did not take any notice of it; and whilst she was at\r\ncards, I chatted very agreeably with Madame de Merteuil, who supped\r\nwith us. We had a great deal of talk about Danceny; and yet I believe\r\nwe were not overheard. She went away, and I retired to my apartment.\r\n\r\nI was undressing when mamma came in, and ordered my waiting maid\r\nto retire; she demanded the key of my escrutoire. The tone in which\r\nshe made this requisition threw me all in a flutter, so that I could\r\nscarcely support myself; I made believe I could not find it: but at\r\nlength I was obliged to obey. The first drawer she opened was the very\r\none where all Chevalier Danceny’s letters were. I was so perplexed,\r\nthat when she asked me what they were, I could give her no other\r\nanswer, but that it was nothing at all; but when I saw she began to\r\nread the first that offered, I had scarce time to fall into a chair,\r\nwhen I fainted. As soon as I recovered, my mother, who had called in\r\nthe waiting maid, retired, desiring me to go to bed. She carried off\r\nall Danceny’s letters. I shudder every time I think that I must appear\r\nbefore her again. I have done nothing but cry all night.\r\n\r\nIt is but just daylight, and I write to you, in hopes that Josephine\r\nwill come. If I can speak to her alone, I shall beg of her to leave a\r\nnote, that I shall write, with Madame de Merteuil; and if I cannot, I\r\nwill put it in your letter, and you will be so good as to send it, as\r\nfrom yourself. It is from her alone that I can receive any consolation.\r\nWe will, at least, speak of him, for I never hope to see him more. I am\r\nvery unhappy. She perhaps will be kind enough to deliver a letter to\r\nDanceny. I dare not confide in Josephine, and still less in my waiting\r\nmaid; for it is, perhaps, she that told my mother that I had letters in\r\nmy desk.\r\n\r\nI will not write to you any more now, because I must have time to write\r\nto Madame de Merteuil and Danceny, and to have all my letters ready,\r\nif she will take charge of them; after that, I will go to bed again,\r\nthat they may find me in bed when they come into my room. I will say I\r\nam ill, to prevent my being called to mamma. I shall not tell a great\r\nlie; for I surely suffer as much as if I had a fever. My eyes are\r\ninflamed with crying; and I have a weight at my stomach, which prevents\r\nme from breathing. When I think I never shall see Danceny more, I wish\r\nI was dead. Farewell, my dear Sophy. I can’t write any more; my tears\r\nsuffocate me.\r\n\r\n_Sept._ 7, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXII.\r\n\r\nMadame de Volanges _to_ Chevalier Danceny.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will certainly not be surprised, Sir, after having so grossly\r\nabused the confidence of a mother, and the innocence of a child, to be\r\nno longer admitted into a house where you have repaid the sincerest\r\nfriendship with the blackest ingratitude. I prefer desiring you\r\nnever more to appear here, rather than giving orders to my servants\r\nto refuse you admittance, which would affect us all, by the remarks\r\nthat would infallibly be made. I have a right to expect you will\r\nnot put me under the necessity of taking this step. I must also\r\nacquaint you, that if you should hereafter make the least attempt to\r\nkeep up a correspondence with my daughter, a severe and everlasting\r\nconfinement shall withdraw her from your solicitations. I leave it\r\nthen to yourself, Sir, to determine whether you will be the cause of\r\nher misery, as you have attempted to be that of her dishonour. As to\r\nmyself, my resolution is fixed, and she’s informed of it.\r\n\r\nI send you, enclosed, all your letters; and I expect you will send me\r\nback those of my daughter; and that you will concur in leaving no mark\r\nof an event, the remembrance of which fills me with indignation; her\r\nwith shame, as it should you with remorse.\r\n\r\n                         I have the honour, &c.\r\n_Sept._ 7, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXIII.\r\n\r\nMarchioness de Merteuil _to_ Viscount de Valmont.\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, certainly, I can explain Danceny’s letter to you. The incident\r\nthat gave birth to it is my work, and I think it a master-piece. I lost\r\nno time since I received your last letter; and, in the words of the\r\nAthenian architect, “What he has said, I will perform.”\r\n\r\nThere must be obstacles then for our hero of romance; and his happiness\r\nlulls him. Oh! leave that to me, I will cut out work for him; and I\r\nam much mistaken if he sleeps so quietly hereafter. It was necessary\r\nto make him sensible of his folly; and I flatter myself that he now\r\nregrets the opportunity he has let slip. You say also, that is\r\nnecessary there should be a little mystery in the business: well,\r\ntake my word for it, that shall not be wanting. I have this good\r\nquality, that if I am but told my faults, I am not at rest till I\r\namend them. Now to inform you what I have done—at my return the day\r\nbefore yesterday, in the morning I received your letter, which is truly\r\nadmirable. Being fully satisfied that you had very well pointed out\r\nthe cause of the disorder, I set about finding the method of cure. But\r\nfirst I lay down; for the indefatigable Chevalier did not suffer me to\r\ntake the least repose; and I thought I should sleep: but no; totally\r\ntaken up with the thoughts of rousing Danceny from his lethargy, or\r\npunishing him for it, I could not close my eyes; and it was not until\r\nafter I had well digested my plan, I got two hours repose.\r\n\r\nI went that same evening to see Madame de Volanges; and told her, in\r\npursuance of my scheme, in a very confidential manner, I was very\r\ncertain there subsisted between her daughter and Danceny a dangerous\r\nconnection. This woman, so penetrating in your business, was blinded\r\nto such a degree, that at first she replied, I certainly was mistaken;\r\nher daughter was but a child, &c. &c. I could not venture to tell her\r\nall I knew: but quoted looks, words, _which much alarmed my friendship\r\nand virtue_. I spoke almost as well as a devotee: to give the finishing\r\nblow to my intelligence, I told her I thought I saw a letter given\r\nand received. That I also recollected she one day opened a drawer in\r\nher bureau, in which I observed several papers, which she doubtless\r\ncarefully preserves. “Do you know any one she corresponds with\r\nfrequently?” At that question Madame de Volanges’ countenance changed,\r\nand I observed some tears drop from her. “I thank you, my worthy\r\nfriend,” said she, squeezing my hand; “I shall inquire into it.”\r\n\r\nAfter this conversation, which was too short to cause any suspicion,\r\nI joined company with the little thing. I left her soon after, to beg\r\nof the mother not to discover to her daughter what I had told; which\r\nshe promised me the more readily, as I observed what a happy thing it\r\nwas that this child had placed such a confidence in me as to open her\r\nheart, which gave me an opportunity of assisting her _with my good\r\nadvice_. I am the more satisfied that she will keep her promise, as no\r\ndoubt she will plume herself on her penetration with her daughter. Thus\r\nI am authorised to keep up the ton of friendship with the little one,\r\nwithout giving umbrage to Madame de Volanges, which must be avoided. I\r\nshall moreover by this means have opportunities of conversing as long\r\nand as secretly as I please with the daughter, without alarming the\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nThis I put in practice that same evening; for after my party at cards\r\nwas ended, I took the young one into a corner, and began upon the\r\nsubject of Danceny, which never fatigues her; and diverted myself in\r\nheating her imagination with the pleasure she would have in seeing him\r\nthe next day: there is no sort of extravagance but what she came into;\r\nit was necessary to pay her in hope, what I took from her in reality;\r\nmoreover, this will make the blow the more sensible; and am confident\r\nthat the more she suffers, the more ready she will be to make herself\r\namends at the first opportunity. We ought to accustom those we intend\r\nfor great adventures, to great events.\r\n\r\nAfter all, she may afford a few tears, for the pleasure of having her\r\nDanceny. She is distracted about him! Well, she shall have him; and\r\nperhaps the sooner for this little storm. It is a troublesome dream\r\nwhich will be most delicious at waking; and, take every thing together,\r\nI think she ought to be grateful. But to the point: I retired very well\r\nsatisfied with myself. Either Danceny, said I, animated by obstacles,\r\nwill redouble his affection, and then I will serve him to the utmost;\r\nor, if he is the booby I am sometimes inclined to think him, he will\r\nbe desperate, and think himself undone: even then, I shall be revenged\r\nof him as much as in my power; I shall have increased the mother’s\r\nesteem for me, the daughter’s friendship, and the confidence of both.\r\nAs to Gercourt, who is the first object of my care, I shall be very\r\nunfortunate, or very awkward indeed, if, having such an ascendant over\r\nhis wife’s mind as I already have, and shall still have more, I did not\r\nfind means of making him what I wish. I laid down with those pleasing\r\nideas, slept very well, and did not awake till it was late.\r\n\r\nIn the morning I found two letters, one from the mother, and the\r\nother from the daughter; and could not help laughing to find in\r\nboth literally this phrase,—“_It is from you alone I expect any\r\nconsolation_.” And indeed it is pleasant enough to console for and\r\nagainst, and to be the sole agent of two interests so directly\r\nopposite. Thus I am like the Divinity, receiving the opposite vows of\r\nblind mortals, without altering my immutable decrees. However, I have\r\nquitted this grand roll, to take on me that of the consoling angel;\r\nand I went, according to the precept, to visit my two friends in their\r\naffliction.\r\n\r\nI began with the mother, who I found in a very melancholy situation,\r\nwhich partly revenges you, for the obstacles you have experienced\r\nfrom your charming prude. Every thing succeeded wonderfully; my only\r\nuneasiness was, lest Madame de Volanges should seize this opportunity\r\nof gaining her daughter’s confidence, which would have been a very\r\neasy matter, if she had used mild and friendly admonitions; and giving\r\nto the advice of reason the tone and air of indulgent tenderness.\r\nFortunately she armed herself with severity; and behaved so badly, that\r\nnothing was left for me but to applaud. It is true she had like to have\r\noverthrown my plan entirely, by the resolution she had taken to shut up\r\nher daughter in the convent; but I warded the blow, and prevailed on\r\nher only to threaten it, in case Danceny should continue his pursuit,\r\nin order to oblige them both to a circumspection which I think so\r\nnecessary for my success.\r\n\r\nFrom thence I went to the daughter: you cannot conceive how much grief\r\nembellished her: if I can only infuse a little coquetry into her, I\r\nwill engage she will cry often: but now she wept sincerely.—Struck\r\nwith this new charm, which I knew not before, and which I was very\r\nglad to observe, at first I gave her a few awkward consolations, which\r\nrather augment than relieve distress; and by this means led her to\r\nalmost a state of suffocation. She cried no longer, and I really began\r\nto fear she would fall into convulsions. I advised her to go to bed,\r\nwhich she agreed to, and was her waiting maid: she had not dressed her\r\nhead, her hair all loose upon her shoulders; her neck quite bare; I\r\nembraced her, she fell back in my arms, and her tears flowed again. Ye\r\ngods, how lovely she was! If the Magdalen was thus, she was much more\r\ndangerous as a penitent, than as a sinner.\r\n\r\nWhen the lovely girl was in bed, I began really to comfort her in good\r\nearnest. I dispelled her fears of the convent, and raised her hopes of\r\nseeing Danceny privately; and sitting by the bedside, “If he was here\r\nnow!” said I.—Enlarging on the subject, I led her from thought to\r\nfancy, so that she soon forgot her affliction. We should have parted\r\nperfectly satisfied with each other, had she not wanted to prevail on\r\nme to deliver a letter to Danceny, which I absolutely refused. I dare\r\nsay my reasons will meet your approbation.\r\n\r\nFirst, it would be running a risk with Danceny; but had that been the\r\nonly reason I could have alleged with the girl, there are a great\r\nmany others I must impart to you. Would it not be risking the fruits\r\nof all my labours, to give our young people so easy a method, and so\r\nspeedily of putting a period to their distress? Moreover, I should not\r\nbe sorry to oblige them employ a domestic in this adventure; for if it\r\nhas a happy issue, as I hope it will, she must feel her consequence\r\nimmediately after marriage; and I know no means so certain of spreading\r\nher fame; or if they did not speak, which would be miraculous\r\nindeed, we could speak for them, and it would be more convenient the\r\nindiscretion should lay with them.\r\n\r\nYou must then infuse this idea into Danceny to-day; as I cannot depend\r\non the little Volanges’ waiting maid, whom she seems diffident of,\r\nyou may point out my faithful Victoire. I shall take care to ensure\r\nsuccess: this idea pleases me much, as the secret will be useful to\r\nus, and not to them; for I am not yet at the end of my story.\r\n\r\nWhilst I excused myself from taking her letter, I every moment dreaded\r\nshe would have mentioned the penny-post, which I scarcely could have\r\nrefused. Fortunately, through ignorance or distress, or that she was\r\nmore anxious for the answer than the letter, which she could not have\r\nhad by the same means, she never mentioned it; but to be guarded\r\nagainst this idea, if it should happen, or at least she should not have\r\nan idea of making use of it, I returned to her mother, and induced her\r\nto take her daughter to the country for a short time;—and where do\r\nyou think? Does not your heart leap for joy? Why, to your old aunt’s,\r\nMadame de Rosemonde. She is to acquaint her of it this day: thus you\r\nare authorised to go to your beloved devotee, who can no longer object\r\nto the scandal of a tête-à-tête; and thanks to my industry, Madame de\r\nVolanges shall herself repair all the mischief she has done you.\r\n\r\nBut hark ye, I must insist you are not to be so taken up with your own\r\naffairs as to neglect this; remember how much I am interested in it.\r\nI wish you to be not only the correspondent, but the confidant, of\r\nthe two young ones; acquaint Danceny, then, of this journey, and make\r\nhim a tender of your services. Remove every difficulty, but that of\r\ndelivering your credentials to his fair one; and remove that obstacle,\r\ninstantly, in pointing out the medium of my chamber-maid. Doubtless\r\nhe will embrace it, and for your reward you will be the confidant of\r\na young heart, which is ever of consequence. The poor little thing,\r\nhow she will blush when she gives you her first letter! I cannot help\r\nthinking the character of a confidant, against which so many prejudices\r\nare formed, appears to be a tolerable relaxation, when one has other\r\nemployment upon their hands, which is your case.\r\n\r\nThe denouement of this intrigue depends entirely upon you. You must\r\nwatch the moment when you are to reunite your actors. The country\r\noffers a thousand opportunities, and Danceny will be ready to fly at\r\nyour first signal; a night, a disguise, a window;—but if the little\r\nthing comes back as she goes, it is your fault; if you think she should\r\nwant any assistance from me, let me know. I think I have given her a\r\ntolerable lesson on the danger of keeping letters, so I may now venture\r\nto write to her; and I am still determined to make her my pupil.\r\n\r\nI believe I forgot to tell you her suspicions, in regard to her\r\ncorrespondent, at first fell upon the waiting maid; but I turned them\r\noff to the confessor; that is killing two birds with one stone.\r\n\r\nAdieu, Viscount! This letter has taken me a long time, and my dinner\r\nhas been put back; but friendship and self-love dictated it.\r\n\r\nYou will receive it at three, that will be time enough.\r\n\r\nComplain of me now if you dare; and go, if you are inclined, to the\r\nComte de B——’s wood: you say he keeps it for the amusement of his\r\nfriends; that man is the friend of the world; but adieu! I am hungry.\r\n\r\n_Sept._ 9, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXIV.\r\n\r\n_The_ Chevalier Danceny _to_ Madame de Volanges.\r\n\r\n(_Annexed to the 66th Letter, from the Viscount to the Marchioness._)\r\n\r\n\r\nWithout seeking, Madam, to justify my conduct, and without the least\r\ncause of complaint of yours, I can only lament the unhappiness of\r\nthree persons all worthy of a better fate. I beg leave to assure you,\r\nmy chagrin, on this occasion, proceeds more from being the cause than\r\nthe victim. Since yesterday, I have often endeavoured to do myself\r\nthe honour of answering your letter, without being able to perform my\r\nresolution; yet I have so many things to say, that I must overcome\r\nevery other consideration; and if this letter is incoherent, you may\r\nvery well imagine that I stand in great need of your indulgence in my\r\npresent painful situation.\r\n\r\nPermit me, therefore, Madam, to demur against the first position of\r\nyour letter. I venture to assure you, I have neither abused your\r\nconfidence, nor Mademoiselle de Volanges’ innocence: I have paid a\r\nproper respect to one and the other, they alone depend on me; and were\r\nyou to make me responsible for an involuntary sentiment, I shall not\r\nbe afraid to declare, that the one Mademoiselle your daughter inspired\r\nme with, may perhaps displease, but ought by no means to offend you.\r\nThis motive, which I feel more than I can express, I leave you and my\r\nletters to determine on.\r\n\r\nYou forbid me to come to your house in future, and I most certainly\r\nwill submit to your pleasure on this occasion; but give me leave to\r\nremonstrate, that such an abrupt absence will give as much cause to\r\nremarks you wish to avoid, as the orders you have declined giving, for\r\nthe same reason, would create; and I think this consideration more\r\nimportant on Mademoiselle de Volanges’ account than my own. I therefore\r\nbeseech you to weigh attentively those things, and not suffer your\r\nseverity to get the better of your prudence. I am confident that the\r\ninterest of your daughter alone will govern your resolutions; I shall\r\ntherefore wait your farther commands.\r\n\r\nYet, if you should think proper to permit me to wait upon you\r\nsometimes, I engage myself, Madam, (and you may depend upon my\r\npromise), I shall not attempt to abuse your condescension, by presuming\r\nto speak in private to Mademoiselle de Volanges, or convey any letter\r\nto her. The dread of doing any thing that might affect her reputation,\r\ninfluences me to this sacrifice; and the happiness of some time seeing\r\nher would be a sufficient recompence.\r\n\r\nThis part of my letter is the only answer I can make to the fate\r\nyou intend for Mademoiselle de Volanges, and which you mean to be\r\ndependent on my conduct. It would be deceiving you to promise more. A\r\nvile seducer may make his projects subservient to circumstances, and\r\ncalculate them to events; but the passion with which I am inspired\r\nadmits of only two sentiments, courage and constancy.\r\n\r\nWhat me, Madam! me consent to be forgotten by Mademoiselle de Volanges,\r\nand I to forget her? No, never! I will be constant to her; she has\r\nreceived my vows, and I now again renew them. Forgive me, Madam; I am\r\ngoing astray; I must resume my reason.\r\n\r\nOne thing more remains to be mentioned, in reply to the letters you\r\nrequire. I am really unhappy to be obliged to add a refusal to the\r\nwrongs you already charge me with: but I beseech you to attend to my\r\nreasons, and vouchsafe to remember to enhance their value: that the\r\nonly consolation I have left for the loss of your friendship, is the\r\nhope of preserving your esteem.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Volanges’ letters, ever precious to me, become more\r\nso at this moment. They are my only felicity; they bring back to my\r\nremembrance the only charm of my life! Yet, I beg you will believe me,\r\nI would not hesitate a moment to sacrifice them to you; and the regret\r\nof being deprived of them, would give way to my strong desire of\r\nproving my most respectful obedience to your orders; but, very powerful\r\nconsiderations, which I am confident you yourself will not blame,\r\nprevent me.\r\n\r\nIt is true you have got the secret from Mademoiselle de Volanges; but\r\npermit me to say, and I believe I am authorised, that it is the effect\r\nof surprise, and not of confidence. I do not pretend to blame the\r\nstep you have taken, which may be sanctioned by your maternal care. I\r\nrespect your right; but that will not dispense me from doing my duty.\r\nThe most sacred of all, I conceive, is not to betray the confidence\r\nreposed in us. I should therefore be in the highest degree guilty,\r\nwere I to expose to the eyes of another the secrets of a heart, which\r\nhas been disclosed to me alone. If Mademoiselle your daughter consents\r\nthey should be given up to you, let her speak—her letters are useless\r\nto you: if, on the contrary, she should think proper to keep her\r\nsecrets to herself, you certainly will not expect, Madam, that I should\r\ndisclose them.\r\n\r\nAs to the secrecy in which you wish this event may remain, rest\r\nsatisfied, Madam, that in every thing that concerns Mademoiselle de\r\nVolanges, I may even set the heart of a mother at defiance. But to\r\ntake away all manner of uneasiness from you, I have provided against\r\nevery accident. This precious deposit, which formerly was superscribed,\r\n_Papers to be burnt_, is endorsed at present, _Papers belonging to\r\nMadame de Volanges_. This resolution may sufficiently convince you that\r\nmy refusal is not influenced by any dread that you should find in those\r\nletters, a single sentiment that you should have any personal cause to\r\ncomplain of.\r\n\r\nThis, Madam, is a very long letter. It would yet, however, be too\r\nshort, if it left you room for the least doubt of the honour of my\r\nsentiments, the sincere regret I am under of having displeased you, and\r\nthe profound respect with which I have the honour to be, &c.\r\n\r\n_Sept._ 7, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXV.\r\n\r\nChevalier Danceny _to_ Cecilia Volanges.\r\n\r\n(_Sent open to the Marchioness de Merteuil, in the 66th Letter of the\r\nViscount._)\r\n\r\n\r\nAh, my Cecilia! what will become of us? What will save us from the\r\nmiseries that hang over us? Love, at least, can give us resolution\r\nto support them. I cannot express my astonishment, my distraction, on\r\nseeing my letters, and reading Madame de Volanges’. Who is it can have\r\nbetrayed us? On whom do your suspicions fall? Is it by any imprudent\r\nact of your own? How do you employ your time? What has been said to\r\nyou? I wish to know all, and am ignorant of every thing. Perhaps you\r\nare in the same situation.\r\n\r\nI enclose you your mamma’s letter, with a copy of my answer to it. I\r\nhope you will approve of what I wrote: and I want much to be satisfied\r\nwhether you will approve of the steps I have taken since this fatal\r\ndiscovery, which all tend to hear from you, and to be able to write to\r\nyou; and, who knows, perhaps to see you again with more freedom than\r\never.\r\n\r\nI can’t express the joy, my Cecilia, I conceive at the prospect of\r\nseeing you once more; renewing my vows of eternal love, and receiving\r\nyours. Who would not bear torments to enjoy so much happiness! I have\r\nthis prospect in view; and the methods I mean to take, are what I\r\nbeseech you to approve. I am indebted for them to the anxiety of a\r\nworthy friend; and I only ask that you will permit my friend to be also\r\nyours.\r\n\r\nBut, perhaps, I ought not to have engaged your confidence without your\r\nconsent; misfortunes and necessity must plead in my favour. It is\r\nlove led me on; it is love solicits your indulgence; implores you to\r\nforgive so necessary a confidence, without which we should be for ever\r\nseparated.[1] You know the friend I mean; he is also the friend of the\r\nwoman you love best—the Viscount Valmont.\r\n\r\nMy design was, to engage him first to prevail on Madame de Merteuil\r\nto deliver you a letter. He was of opinion this scheme would not\r\nsucceed; but he will answer for her waiting-maid, who lays under some\r\nobligations to him. She will then deliver you this letter, and you may\r\ntrust her with your answer.\r\n\r\nThis means will be of very little use, if, as Mr. de Valmont tells me,\r\nyou are to set out immediately for the country: but in that case he\r\nwill be our friend. The lady, to whose house you are going, is his near\r\nrelation. He will make use of this pretence to go there at the same\r\ntime that you do; and we can carry on our correspondence through him.\r\nHe even assures me, if you leave the management to him, he will provide\r\nus the means of seeing each other, without danger of a discovery.\r\n\r\nNow, my dear Cecilia, if you love me, if you compassionate my\r\nmisfortunes, if, as I hope, you partake my sorrows, you will not refuse\r\nyour confidence to a man who will be our guardian angel. Were it not\r\nfor his assistance, I should be reduced even to despair of being able\r\nto soften the distresses I have caused you: I hope they will soon be\r\nat an end. But, my dearest life, promise me not to give way to them;\r\nneither suffer yourself to be too much dejected. The idea of your grief\r\nis an insupportable torment to me. I would cheerfully die to make you\r\nhappy; you know it well. May the certainty of being adored, bring some\r\nsmall consolation to your soul. Let me be assured you pardon the evils\r\nmy love has made you suffer, for my consolation.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear Cecilia!\r\n\r\n_Sept._ 9, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Mr. Danceny is wrong; for he had already made a confidant of Mons.\r\nde Valmont. See Letter the 57th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXVI.\r\n\r\n_The_ Viscount de Valmont _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you have read the two enclosed letters, you will be able to judge,\r\nmy charming friend, whether I have fulfilled your commission. Although\r\nthey are both dated to-day, they were wrote yesterday, at my house,\r\nand under my inspection; that to the girl is every thing we could\r\nwish. I am humbled by the depth of your wisdom, if one may judge by\r\nthe success of your proceedings. Danceny is all on fire; and you may\r\nbe certain, that at the first opportunity, you will have nothing to\r\nreproach him with. If his fair one will be but tractable, every thing\r\nwill terminate as we wish in a little time after her arrival in the\r\ncountry. I am provided with sufficient schemes; thanks to your care. I\r\nam now decidedly Danceny’s friend.\r\n\r\nThis same Danceny is yet very young. Would you believe it? I have never\r\nyet been able to prevail on him to promise the mother to renounce\r\nhis love; as if there was any difficulty in promising, when one is\r\ndetermined not to keep one’s word. It would be deceitful, says he\r\nincessantly. Is not this a most edifying scruple, especially when he is\r\nabout seducing the daughter? This is the true picture of mankind; all\r\nequally profligate in their projects: if any weakness happens in the\r\nexecution, they call it probity.\r\n\r\nIt is now your business to hinder Madame de Volanges from being\r\nstartled at what little indiscretions he may have let fall in his\r\nletter; keep us out of the convent; endeavour to make her relinquish\r\nher demand of the little one’s letters: for he will not give them up,\r\nand I am of opinion he ought not: here love and sound sense agree. I\r\nhave read those letters; I could hardly bear it; however, they may\r\nhereafter be useful.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all our discretion, something may blaze abroad,\r\nwhich might break off the marriage, and render abortive all our\r\nGercourt schemes: but as I must be revenged of the mother, for my own\r\nsatisfaction, in that case, I must reserve to myself the debauching of\r\nthe daughter. In selecting those letters, and only producing a part,\r\nthe little Volanges would appear to have made the first advances,\r\nand have absolutely given herself up: and some of the letters might\r\neven entangle the mother, or, at least, make her appear guilty of an\r\nunpardonable negligence. I readily conceive, that the scrupulous\r\nDanceny would at first be startled; but as he would be personally\r\nattacked, I believe he might be brought to. It is a thousand to one,\r\nthat it does not happen so; but we must provide against everything.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my lovely friend! I would be glad you could sup to-morrow at the\r\nMarechale de ——; I could not be off.\r\n\r\nI think it unnecessary to recommend secrecy with Madame Volanges, about\r\nmy country jaunt: she would soon take it into her head to remain in\r\ntown; but when once arrived, she will not go back the next day; and if\r\nshe only gives us eight days, I will answer for every thing.\r\n\r\n_Sept._. 9, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXVII.\r\n\r\n_The_ Presidente de Tourvel _to the_ Viscount de Valmont.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was determined not to answer you any more, Sir, and, perhaps, the\r\nembarrassment I now experience, is the strongest proof that I ought\r\nnot. Notwithstanding, I will leave you no cause of complaint against\r\nme; and will convince you that I have done every thing I ought.\r\n\r\nI gave you leave to write to me, you say? I admit it; but when you put\r\nme in mind of this permission, do you think I forget the conditions\r\non which it was granted? If I had adhered to them as strictly as you\r\nhave disregarded them, you would not have received a single line from\r\nme; yet this is now the third, and whilst you are doing every thing\r\nyou possibly can to oblige me to break off this correspondence, I am\r\nemployed in the means of keeping it up. There is one, and it is the\r\nonly one, which, if you refuse, will be sufficient proof, say what you\r\nwill, how little you esteem it:\r\n\r\nGive over, then, a language that I neither can nor will hear; renounce\r\na passion that terrifies and offends me; and which, perhaps, you should\r\nbe the less attached to, as it is the only obstacle that separates us.\r\nIs this passion, then, the only one that you are capable of? is it so\r\npowerful as to exclude friendship? and could you possibly not wish to\r\nhave her for a friend, whom you would wish to inspire with more tender\r\nsentiments? I cannot believe it: this humiliating idea would turn me\r\nagainst you for ever!\r\n\r\nThus offering you my friendship, Sir, I give you every thing that\r\nbelongs to me; every thing that is at my disposal; what can you wish\r\nfor more? To this proposition, so pleasing to my mind, I shall expect\r\nyour consent; as also, your word of honour, that this friendship will\r\nconstitute your happiness. I shall forget every thing that has been\r\nrelated to me, and I will depend upon your care to justify my choice.\r\n\r\nYou see how frankly I deal with you, which ought to be a proof of my\r\nconfidence in you; it rests with you to increase it still more; but\r\nI must inform you, that the first expression of love will for ever\r\ndestroy it, and will bring back all my fears: it will be the first\r\nsignal of an eternal silence from me to you.\r\n\r\nIf, as you say, _you have abandoned your errors,_ would you not rather\r\nbe the object of friendship of a virtuous woman, than that of the\r\nremorse of a guilty one? Adieu, Sir! You may conceive that having said\r\nthus much, I can say nothing more that you have not already answered.\r\n\r\n_Sept._ 9, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXVIII.\r\n\r\nViscount de Valmont _to the_ Presidente de Tourvel.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is it possible, Madam, to answer your last letter; how shall I dare\r\nspeak truth, when my sincerity may ruin me with you? Yet I must; I\r\noften tell myself, I would rather deserve than obtain you; and were you\r\nfor ever to refuse me a happiness I incessantly wish for, I will at\r\nleast make you acknowledge, that my heart is worthy of it.\r\n\r\nWhat a pity it is, as you say, _that I have abandoned my errors_, with\r\nwhat transport should I not have read that letter which I tremble\r\nto answer to-day? You deal _frankly_ with me; you testify your\r\n_confidence_. You even offer me your friendship: how bountiful are you,\r\nMadam, and how much I regret I cannot benefit by them. Why am I no\r\nlonger the same!\r\n\r\nFor if I really was, if I had but a common passion for you, that slight\r\ndesire, the child of seduction and pleasure, which is yet now called\r\nlove, I would speedily take advantage of every thing I could obtain,\r\nwithout being much concerned about the delicacy of the measures,\r\nprovided they ensured success. I would flatter your frankness, in order\r\nto dive into you; I would endeavour to gain your confidence, with an\r\nintention to betray it; I would accept your friendship in the hope of\r\nleading you astray.—This picture, no doubt, alarms you, Madam;—but\r\nit would be the true portrait of myself, if I was to tell you that I\r\nconsented to be your friend only.\r\n\r\nWhat! Should I consent to share with another a sentiment proceeding\r\nfrom your soul? If I should ever tell you so, do not believe me. From\r\nthat moment I would seek to deceive you; I might still have desires,\r\nbut I certainly would love you no longer.\r\n\r\nNot but your amiable frankness, your charming confidence, and your\r\npleasing friendship, are immensely valuable to me;—but love,\r\nsincere love, such as you have inspired me with, reuniting all those\r\nsentiments, by giving them more energy, cannot, as they do, be\r\nsatisfied with that tranquillity, that ease of mind, which will allow\r\nof comparisons, and even sometimes of preferences. No, Madam, I will\r\nnot be your friend, I will love you with the most ardent and tender\r\naffection, and yet the most respectful. You may deprive it of hope, but\r\nyou cannot annihilate it.\r\n\r\nWhat right have you to pretend to dispose of a heart, whose homage you\r\nrefuse? By what refinement of cruelty do you envy me the happiness\r\nof my love? It belongs to me; and is independent of you; and I know\r\nhow to preserve it. If it is the source, it is also the remedy of my\r\nmisfortunes. Once more no, persist in your cruel resolutions; but leave\r\nme love. You enjoy the pleasure of my misery; be it so, endeavour to\r\ntire out my perseverance, I shall at least know how to oblige you to\r\ndecide my fate; and you may, perhaps, one day do me justice. Not\r\nthat I ever hope to make you sensible of my pain, but you shall be\r\nconvinced, though not persuaded; and you shall say I have judged him\r\ntoo severely.\r\n\r\nBut you are unjust to yourself: to see you without loving you, to\r\nlove you without being constant, are both equally impossible; and,\r\nnotwithstanding the modesty that adorns you, it must be easier for you\r\nto lament, than be astonished at the sentiments you gave birth to. But\r\nas for me, whose only merit is to have discovered their value, I will\r\nnot lose it; and far from agreeing to your insidious offers, I again\r\nrenew, at your feet, the oaths I have made to love you eternally.\r\n\r\n_Sept._ 10, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXIX.\r\n\r\nCecilia Volanges _to the_ Chevalier Danceny.\r\n\r\n(_Wrote with a pencil, and re-copied by Danceny._)\r\n\r\n\r\nYou desire to know how I spend my time? I love you, and am always\r\ncrying. My mother speaks to me no longer; she has taken away my paper,\r\npens, and ink; I now make use of a pencil, which I fortunately had\r\nin my pocket, and I write this on the back of your letter. I must\r\ncertainly approve of whatever you have done; I love you too well, not\r\nto use every means to hear from you, and give you some account of\r\nmyself. I did not use to love Mr. de Valmont; I did not think him to\r\nbe so much your friend; I will endeavour to accustom myself to him, and\r\nI will love him on your account. I cannot tell who betrayed us; it must\r\nbe either my waiting-maid or my confessor. I am very unhappy: to-morrow\r\nwe set out for the country, and I do not know for how long a time. Good\r\nGod, not to see you any more! I have no more room, adieu! Endeavour to\r\nread this. Those letters, wrote with a pencil, will, perhaps, rub out;\r\nbut the sentiments engraved on my heart never will.\r\n\r\n_Sept._. 10, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXX.\r\n\r\nViscount de Valmont _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear friend, I have a most important piece of news for you: last\r\nnight I supped, as you know, at the Marechale de ——, where you\r\nwere spoke of; I said not all the good that I think, but all that I\r\ndid not think of you. Every one seemed to be of my opinion, and the\r\nconversation languished, as it always happens when people talk well of\r\ntheir neighbours; when at length Prevan spoke, “God forbid,” said he,\r\nrising up, “that I should have the least doubt of the virtue of Madame\r\nde Merteuil; but I dare say, that she owes it more to levity than\r\nprinciple. It is, perhaps, easier to please her, than follow her; and\r\nas one seldom fails in running after a woman, to meet others in one’s\r\nway, those may be as much, if not more, valuable than she; some are\r\ndissipated by a new taste, others stop through lassitude; and she is,\r\nperhaps, one of the women who has had the least opportunity of making a\r\nresistance, of any of Paris; for my part,” said he, (encouraged by the\r\nsmiles of some of the women), “I will not credit Madame de Merteuil’s\r\nvirtue, until I have killed six horses in her service.”\r\n\r\nThis scurvy jest succeeded, as all those do that are replete with\r\nscandal; and whilst the laugh went round, Prevan seated himself, and\r\nthe conversation became general; but the two Countesses de B——,\r\nnear whom the incredulous Prevan seated himself, began a particular\r\nconversation which I overheard.\r\n\r\nThe challenge that was given to bring you to compliance was accepted;\r\nand the promise of telling all was exchanged; of all those which passed\r\nin this conversation, that will be the most religiously observed: but\r\nnow you have timely notice; and you know the old proverb.\r\n\r\nI have only to tell you, moreover, that this Prevan, who you do\r\nnot know, is amazingly amiable, and still more subtle. If you have\r\nsometimes heard me say the contrary, it is only because I don’t like\r\nhim, and that I delight in contradicting his successes; for I am not\r\nignorant how my opinion weighs with some thirty of our women à-la-mode.\r\n\r\nAnd really I have, for a long time, prevented him by this means,\r\nof making a figure in what is called the grand theatre. He worked\r\nprodigies without advancing his reputation. But the eclat of his triple\r\nadventure, by fixing every one’s eyes on him, has given him a certain\r\nair of confidence that he, until then, wanted, and has made him truly\r\nformidable. He is, perhaps, at this time, the only man I dread meeting\r\nin my way; and, your interests apart, you will do me the greatest\r\nservice in making him ridiculous. I leave him in good hands; and I hope\r\nat my return he will be a lost man.\r\n\r\nIn recompence, I promise you to bring the adventure of your pupil to a\r\ngood issue, and to employ my time as much for her as my lovely prude.\r\n\r\nShe has just now sent me a plan of capitulation. Her whole letter\r\nannounces a wish to be deceived. It is impossible to offer any means\r\nmore commodious, or more stale. She will have me to be her friend. But\r\nI, who am fond of new and difficult methods, will not let her off so\r\neasily; for certainly I have not taken so much pains about her, to\r\nterminate by the ordinary methods of seduction.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, my design is, that she should feel the value, and the\r\nextent, of every one of the sacrifices she shall make; not to lead\r\nher on so fast, but that remorse may follow every step; to make her\r\nvirtue expire in a slow agony; to fix her attention incessantly on that\r\nmortifying spectacle, and not to grant her the happiness of having me\r\nin her arms, till I have forced her to no longer dissemble her desire:\r\nfor I am worth little indeed, if I am not worth the trouble of asking.\r\nThen I shall be revenged of a haughty woman, who seems to blush to own\r\nshe adores.\r\n\r\nI have then refused this precious friendship, and hold to my title of\r\nlover. As I am not ignorant that this title, which at first appears\r\nbut trifling, is, notwithstanding, of real importance to be obtained,\r\nI took peculiar care of my style, and endeavoured to scatter through\r\nmy letter that kind of disorder which only can display sentiment, and\r\ntalked as much nonsense as possible; for, without that, there is no\r\ntenderness: that, I believe, is the reason that women excel us so much\r\nin love letters.\r\n\r\nI finished mine by a soothing sentence; that is another consequence of\r\nmy profound observations. After a woman’s heart has been some time kept\r\nin exercise, it wants rest: and I have often remarked, that a flattery\r\nis, for all of them, the softest pillow we can offer.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my lovely friend. I set out to-morrow. If you have any orders\r\nto give me for the Countess de ——, I shall stop with her to dinner.\r\nI am sorry to set out without seeing you. Forward me your sublime\r\ninstructions, and assist me with your wise counsels in the decisive\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nAbove all, beware of Prevan; and may I one day indemnify you for this\r\nsacrifice. Adieu!\r\n\r\n_Sept._ 11, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXI.\r\n\r\nViscount de Valmont _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy blundering huntsman has left my letter-case at Paris. My fair one’s\r\nletters, Danceny’s for the little Volanges, all is left behind; and I\r\nwant them all. He is just going to set off to repair his folly; and\r\nwhile he saddles his horse, I take the opportunity to give you a\r\ndetail of my night’s adventure; for I hope you will believe I don’t\r\nlose time.\r\n\r\nIt is in itself but trifling; being nothing more than another heat with\r\nthe Viscountess de M———. The detail however is interesting. I am\r\nmoreover pleased to let you know, that if I have the talent of ruining\r\nthe women, I am no less clever in saving them when I am inclined. The\r\nmost lively, or most difficult side, is what I always choose; and I\r\nnever reproach myself with doing a good act, provided it entertains and\r\namuses me.\r\n\r\nI found the Viscountess here; and as she was very pressing with the\r\nother solicitations, that I should sleep here, “Well, I agree,” said\r\nI, “on condition I sleep with you.”—“That is impossible,” said she;\r\n“Vressac is here.” Until then I only meant to pass a joke; but the word\r\n_impossible_ roused me as usual. I was humbled to be sacrificed to\r\nVressac; I determined not to bear it, and insisted on it.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances were not favourable for me. Vressac has been foolish\r\nenough to give umbrage to the Viscount; so that she cannot see him any\r\nlonger at home: and this journey to the good Countess was concerted\r\nbetween them, to endeavour to steal a few nights. The Viscount seemed\r\nto be out of temper at meeting Vressac here; but as his passion for\r\nhunting is stronger than his jealousy, he has remained, notwithstanding\r\nthe Countess, whom you well know, having fixed the wife in an apartment\r\nin the great gallery; placed the husband on one side, and the lover on\r\nthe other, and left them to settle the matter between themselves. Their\r\nevil genius would have it that I should be lodged opposite to them.\r\n\r\nYesterday Vressac, who, as you may believe, humours the Viscount,\r\nhunted with him, notwithstanding it is a diversion he is not fond of,\r\nand reckoned he would be consoled at night in the embraces of the wife,\r\nfor the chagrin the husband gave him that day: but as I imagined he\r\nwould have occasion for repose, I resolved to prevail on his mistress\r\nto give him time to take it.\r\n\r\nI succeeded, and induced her to pick a quarrel with him about this\r\nhunting match, which he evidently agreed to only for her sake. A worse\r\npretence never could have been hit on: but no woman knows better than\r\nthe Viscountess how to employ that usual talent of all, to affect ill\r\ntemper instead of reason, and to be never so difficult to be appeased\r\nas when they are in the wrong. Besides, it was not a convenient time\r\nfor explanations; and as I only wished for one night with her, I\r\nconsented they should make it up the next day.\r\n\r\nVressac was then huffed at his return. He wanted to know the reason she\r\nquarrelled with him; he endeavoured to justify himself; the husband,\r\nwho was present, was the apology for breaking off the conversation;\r\nhe however attempted to seize the opportunity, when the husband was\r\nabsent, to beg he might be heard at night. Then the Viscountess was\r\nsublime: she was exasperated at the audacity of men, who, because\r\nthey have experienced a woman’s affection, think themselves entitled\r\nto abuse it; when, at the same time, the woman has every cause to\r\nbe offended; and having changed her argument, she spoke so well, on\r\ndelicacy and sentiment, that Vressac was mute and confounded; and I\r\neven thought she was right: for you must know, as a friend to both, I\r\nmade up the trio.\r\n\r\nShe at length declared positively she would not increase the fatigues\r\nof the chase by the additional ones of love, and that she could not\r\nthink of disturbing such pleasing amusements. The husband returned.\r\nThe unhappy Vressac, who could no longer reply, addressing himself to\r\nme; after relating, with much circumlocution, his reasons, which I was\r\nas well satisfied with as he could be, requested I would speak to the\r\nViscountess, which I promised him: and I did; but it was to thank her,\r\nand settle the hour and method of meeting.\r\n\r\nShe informed me, that, being situated between her husband and lover,\r\nshe thought it more prudent to go to Vressac, than to receive him in\r\nher apartment; and that as I was fixed opposite to her, she thought it\r\nwould be better to come to my room; that she would come the moment her\r\nmaid left her; only to leave my door open, and wait for her.\r\n\r\nEvery thing was done as agreed on; and she came to me about one.\r\n\r\nNot being much inclined to vanity, I shall not enter into particulars:\r\nhowever, you know me well; I was well pleased with myself.\r\n\r\nAt dawn of day we were forced to part. Here the tale begins. The giddy\r\ncreature thought she had left her door half open; we found it shut,\r\nand the key withinside. You can’t conceive the distraction of the\r\nViscountess. “Ah! I am undone,” she exclaimed. I must own it would\r\nhave been whimsical to have left her so; but was it possible to think\r\na woman should be ruined for me, that was not ruined by me? And should\r\nI, as the generality of men do, be overcome by an accident? A lucky\r\nthought occurred, and thus I settled the business.\r\n\r\nI soon perceived the door might be broke upon, but not without some\r\nnoise. With some difficulty I prevailed on the Viscountess to cry out,\r\nRobbers, murder, thieves, &c. &c. We had so settled it, that, at the\r\nfirst alarm, I should burst open the door, and she should fly to her\r\nbed. Yon can’t imagine how difficult it was to make her resolve, even\r\nafter she had consented. She was, however, obliged to comply; and at\r\nthe first burst the door flew open.\r\n\r\nThe Viscountess was right not to lose a moment; for instantly the\r\nViscount and Vressac were in the gallery, and the waiting maid in her\r\nmistress’s chamber.\r\n\r\nI alone was cool, and overturned a watch light that was burning; for it\r\nwould have been ridiculous to have feigned such a panic, having a light\r\nin the room. I scolded the husband and lover for their drowsiness,\r\nconfidently insisting that her cries, and my efforts to burst open the\r\ndoor, had lasted at least five minutes.\r\n\r\nThe Viscountess, who recovered her courage in bed, seconded me\r\ntolerably well, and strenuously insisted there was a robber in her\r\nroom; but with something more sincerity she declared she never had\r\nbeen more frightened in her life. We searched every where, but found\r\nnothing; at last I made them observe the watch light overturned: we\r\nconcluded a rat had given us this fright and disturbance. My opinion\r\nwas unanimously adopted. After some stale jests on rats, the Viscount\r\nreturned to bed, begging she would in future choose more peaceable rats.\r\n\r\nVressac drew near the Viscountess, and passionately told her, Love\r\nrevenged him; to which she replied, fixing her eyes on me, “He must\r\nthen have been very angry indeed: for he has had ample satisfaction;\r\nbut I am much fatigued, and want rest.”\r\n\r\nI was very well pleased. Before we parted, I pleaded so powerfully for\r\nVressac, that I brought about a reconciliation. The lovers embraced,\r\nand I also received theirs. I was indifferent to the Viscountess’s\r\nkisses; but I own I was pleased with Vressac’s. We left her; after\r\nhaving received his thanks, we returned to our beds.\r\n\r\nIf the tale diverts you, I don’t mean to bind you to secrecy. Now I\r\nhave had my amusement, it is right the public should also have their\r\nshare. For this time you have only the history; hereafter we shall talk\r\nof the heroine.\r\n\r\nAdieu. My huntsman has been in waiting an hour. I particularly\r\nrecommend it to you to be on your guard against Prevan.\r\n\r\n_From the Castle of ——,\r\nSept._ 15, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXII.\r\n\r\nChevalier Danceny _to_ Cecilia Volanges.\r\n\r\n(_Delivered only the_ 14_th._)\r\n\r\n\r\nOh, my Cecilia! How much I envy Valmont’s good fortune; to-morrow he\r\nwill see you. He will deliver you this letter; whilst I, languishing\r\nfar from you, will lead a wretched lingering life. Between regret\r\nand misery, my life, my dearest life, pity me not only for my own\r\nmisfortunes, but also for yours; for it is they that deprive me of my\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\nHow dreadful the reflection, to be the cause of your misery! Had it not\r\nbeen for me, you would have been happy; will you forgive me? Speak!\r\nSay you forgive me; tell me you love me; that you will love me ever,\r\nwhich is the only consolation that is now left me. Not that I doubt it;\r\nbut it relieves my anguish; you love me then? Yes, you love me with\r\nyour whole heart. I do not forget it was the last word you spoke: it is\r\ntreasured in mine; it is there deeply engraved. With what transports\r\ndid my heart answer it!\r\n\r\nAlas, in that happy moment, I was far from foreseeing the dreadful fate\r\nthat awaited us! Let us seek for means to soften it. If I am to believe\r\nmy friend, it will be enough that you should have the confidence in him\r\nhe deserves. I was chagrined, I must own, at the disadvantageous idea\r\nyou had of him. I knew the bad opinion your mamma had imbibed, and in\r\nsubmission to that opinion, I had, for some time, neglected a truly\r\namiable man, who now is ready to serve me; who endeavours to reunite\r\nus, whilst your mamma has cruelly torn you from me. I conjure you,\r\nmy love, to have a more favourable opinion of him; remember he is my\r\nfriend, and wishes to be yours; that he can procure me the happiness of\r\nseeing you. If those reasons do not convince you, my Cecilia, you do\r\nnot love me as much as I love you; you no longer love me as you did.\r\nAh! if you should ever love me less,—but no, Cecilia’s heart is mine:\r\nI have it for life; and if I must feel the torments of an unsuccessful\r\npassion, her constancy, at least, will insure me the inexpressible joy\r\nof a permanent affection.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my lovely dear! Do not forget that I suffer; it will be your\r\nfault if I am not perfectly happy; attend to the vows of my heart, and\r\nreceive the tender kisses of love.\r\n\r\n_Sept._ 11, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXIII.\r\n\r\nViscount de Valmont _to_ Cecilia Volanges.\r\n\r\n(_Annexed to the foregoing._)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe friend who takes upon him to assist you, knows that you have not\r\nmaterials to write with, therefore has provided them for you. You will\r\nfind in the anti-chamber of your apartment, under the great clothes\r\npress on the left hand, paper, pens, and ink, which he will renew\r\nwhenever you please, and which, he thinks, you may leave in the same\r\nplace, if you cannot find a better.\r\n\r\nHe requests you will not be offended, if he seems to take little notice\r\nof you in company, and only to treat you as a child. This behaviour\r\nappears necessary to him, to avoid suspicion, and to be able more\r\neffectually to bring about your and his friend’s happiness. He will\r\nendeavour to get opportunities to speak to you, when he has any thing\r\nto say or to give you; and hopes to be able to accomplish it, if, on\r\nyour part, you will second him.\r\n\r\nHe also advises you to give him the letters you will receive, after you\r\nhave read them, in order to avoid all bad consequences.\r\n\r\nHe finishes his letter by assuring you, if you confide in him, he will\r\nemploy his utmost endeavours to soften the persecution that a cruel\r\nmother makes two persons undergo; one of which is his best friend, and\r\nthe other seems to him to deserve his tenderest concern.\r\n\r\n_Castle of ——, Sept._ 14, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXIV.\r\n\r\nMarchioness de Merteuil _to_ Viscount de Valmont.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are very soon alarmed, my dear friend: this Prevan must be\r\nformidable indeed, but what a simple modest creature am I, who have\r\noften met this haughty conqueror, and have scarce ever looked at\r\nhim; nothing less than your letter would have made me pay the least\r\nattention to him. I corrected my error yesterday; he was at the Opera,\r\nalmost opposite to me; I was captivated with him. He is not only\r\nhandsome, but very handsome; fine delicate features, and must improve\r\non a clearer inspection. You say, he wants to have me, he certainly\r\nwill do me a great deal of honour and pleasure; but seriously, I have\r\ntaken a fancy to him, and tell you, in confidence, I have taken the\r\nfirst step towards an advance. I do not know whether I shall succeed,\r\nbut this is fact.\r\n\r\nHe was at a very little distance from me, coming out of the Opera, and\r\nI gave a rendezvous to the Marquis de ———, to sup on Friday at the\r\nLady Marechale’s, so loud that he might hear, which, I believe, is\r\nthe only house I can meet him in; and have not the least doubt but he\r\nheard me. If the ungrateful wretch should not come—Tell me sincerely,\r\ndo you think he will? I protest if he does not, I shall be out of\r\ntemper the whole evening. You see he will not find so much _difficulty\r\nin following me;_ and what will surprise you more is, he will find\r\nless, in _pleasing me._. He says he will kill six horses in paying his\r\naddresses to me; oh! the poor animals shall not die. I should never\r\nhave patience to wait so long. You know it is not my principle to make\r\nany one languish, when once I am decided in their favour, as I really\r\nam in his.\r\n\r\nNow, you must agree, there is some pleasure in talking rationally to\r\nme, has not your _important advice_ had great success; but what can I\r\ndo? I vegetate for a long time; it is more than six weeks since I have\r\npermitted myself a gaiety; this is the first, how can I refuse it? Is\r\nnot the subject worth the trouble? Can there be any one more agreeable\r\nin every sense of the word?\r\n\r\nYou are obliged to do him justice; you do more than praise him; you are\r\njealous of him. Well, I shall judge between you both, but first I must\r\ntake informations, and that is what I mean to do. Be assured I shall\r\nbe an upright judge; you shall be both weighed in the same scale;\r\nfor your part, I have already received your memorial, am entirely\r\nacquainted with your affairs. Is it not reasonable that I should also\r\nknow your adversary’s case? Come, go through your business with a good\r\ngrace, and to begin, inform me, I beg of you, this triple adventure,\r\nof which he is the hero. You talk to me as if I knew the whole matter,\r\nwho never heard a word of it. Probably it happened during the time of\r\nmy journey to Geneva, and your jealousy prevented you from giving me\r\nan account of it. Repair this fault immediately; remember _that every\r\nthing that_ interests him, _is of consequence to me_. I think it was\r\nspoke of at my return; but I was so taken up with other matters, I\r\nrarely pay attention to any thing of this kind that is not new.\r\n\r\nIf what I require should be even contrary to your inclination,\r\nremember how much you are indebted to me for the cares and solicitude\r\nI have had upon your account. Is it not to them you are indebted for\r\nbeing now with your Presidente, when your own folly drove you from her?\r\nHave I not put it in your power to be revenged of Madame de Volanges,\r\nfor her acrimonious zeal against you? How often have you deplored the\r\ntime you lost in search of adventures, now you have them at command?\r\nLove, hatred, make your choice, they are under the same roof with you;\r\nby doubling your existence, you can caress with the one hand, and\r\nstrike with the other.\r\n\r\nIt is to me even you are indebted, for the adventure of the\r\nViscountess—It pleases me. I agree with you it must be published, for\r\nif the opportunity influenced you, as I am apt to think, to prefer\r\nmystery to rumour; at that time must acknowledge, notwithstanding,\r\nthis woman does not deserve so handsome a procedure.\r\n\r\nMoreover, I have reason to dislike her; the Chevalier de Belleroche\r\nthinks her handsomer than me, and for several reasons I would be glad\r\nto break off with her; there is none more plausible than to have a\r\nstory to relate, one cannot keep company with her after.\r\n\r\nFarewell, Viscount! Remember that as you are situated, time is\r\nprecious: I will employ mine in thinking how to make Prevan happy.\r\n\r\n_Sept._ 15, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXV.\r\n\r\nCecilia Volanges _to_ Sophia Carnay.\r\n\r\n[In this Letter, Cecilia Volanges gives a most circumstantial account\r\nof every thing that relates to herself, in the events which the reader\r\nhas seen at the end of the first volume, the 59th Letter, and the\r\nfollowing; for this reason a repetition was thought unnecessary; at\r\nlast she speaks of Viscount de Valmont, and thus expresses herself:]\r\n\r\n\r\nI assure you he is a very extraordinary man: my mamma speaks very ill\r\nof him, but the Chevalier Danceny is enamoured with him, and I believe\r\nhe is in the right. I never saw a man so artful; when he gave me\r\nDanceny’s letter, it was amongst a good deal of company, and no one\r\nknew any thing of the matter. It is true I was very much frightened,\r\nbecause I had no notion of any such thing, but hereafter I shall be on\r\nthe watch. I conceive, already, how he would have me return the answer;\r\nit is very easy to understand him, for he has an eye tells one every\r\nthing; I do not know how he contrives: he told me in the note which I\r\nmentioned to you, he would not seem to take any notice of me before\r\nmamma; really one would imagine he never thinks of it, and yet every\r\ntime I want to look at him, I am sure to meet his eyes fixed upon me.\r\n\r\nThere is a lady here, also an intimate friend of mamma’s, I did not\r\nknow, who appears to me not to like Mr. de Valmont. Although he seems\r\nto be all attention to her, I am afraid he will soon grow tired of this\r\nlife, and return to Paris; that would be dreadful indeed! He must be\r\nan exceeding good-natured man, to come here on purpose to serve his\r\nfriend and me. I wish to know how I could testify my gratitude; but I\r\ndon’t know how to speak to him; and if I even had the opportunity, I\r\nshould be so ashamed I should not know what to say.\r\n\r\nI cannot speak to any body freely, about my love affair, but Madame de\r\nMerteuil; perhaps even with thee, to whom I tell every thing, if it was\r\nin a chatting way, I should be abashed. Even with Danceny himself, I\r\nhave often felt, as it were, against my inclination, a kind of fear,\r\nwhich prevented me from saying every thing I could wish. I am very\r\nsorry for it now, and I would give any thing in the world for a moment,\r\nto tell him only once how much I love him. Mr. de Valmont has promised\r\nhim, if I will be ruled by him, he will find an opportunity for us to\r\nsee each other. I am very well inclined to do whatever he would have\r\nme; but I can’t conceive how it is possible.\r\n\r\nFarewell, my dear friend: I have no more room.[1]\r\n\r\n_From the Castle of ——, Sept._ 14, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Mademoiselle de Volanges having a little time after changed her\r\nconfidant, as will be seen in the following Letters, there will no more\r\nbe given in this collection of those she continued to write to her\r\nfriend in the convent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXVI.\r\n\r\nViscount de Valmont _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nI cannot comprehend you; you were either in a whimsical mood, or, when\r\nyou wrote, in a very dangerous fit of madness. If I did not know you\r\nvery well, my charming friend, I should be really alarmed; and, colour\r\nit as you will, I should have a great deal of reason.\r\n\r\nVainly do I read, and read again, your letter. I can’t conceive\r\nyou; for it is impossible to take your letter in the style it is\r\ncouched; what did you then mean to say? Did you only mean there was\r\nno occasion to give oneself so much trouble against so despicable an\r\nenemy: if so, you are wrong. Prevan is really amiable; he is more so\r\nthan you imagine; and has, in a peculiar manner, that happy talent\r\nof interesting one much about love affairs, which he introduces on\r\nevery occasion, and in all companies. Few women can avoid the snare of\r\nreplication, because, as they all have pretensions to artifice, none\r\nwill lose the opportunity of displaying it. And I need not tell you\r\nthat a woman, who consents to talk of love, commonly ends with being\r\nentrapped, or, at least, acts as if she was. He refines on this method,\r\nwhich he has even brought to a science, by often introducing the women\r\nthemselves as witnesses of their own defeat: this I aver, and can prove.\r\n\r\nI was let into the secret only at second hand; for I never was intimate\r\nwith Prevan. We were six in company: the Countess de P——, thinking\r\nherself amazingly fine, and even possessing the talent of keeping up a\r\ngeneral conversation well, related to us minutely the manner she had\r\nsurrendered to Prevan, with all circumstances. She gave the recital\r\nwith so much composure, that she was not even disconcerted at a smile\r\nwhich escaped us all at the same time. I shall never forget, one of\r\nus, to excuse himself, feigned to doubt what she said, or rather what\r\nshe related; she gravely answered, that none of us could be so well\r\ninformed as she; and she was not even afraid to call upon Prevan, and\r\nask him whether she had omitted a single circumstance.\r\n\r\nThis I think sufficient to call him a very dangerous man: but is it not\r\nenough for you, Marchioness, he is _handsome, very handsome,_ as you\r\nsay? Or that he should make on you _one of those attacks that you are\r\nsometimes fond of rewarding, for no other motive, but because you think\r\nit well carried on?_ Or that you would think it pleasing to surrender\r\nfor any reason whatever? Or—but it is impossible for me to guess the\r\ninfinity of whims which rule the minds of women, and by which alone you\r\nresemble your sex. Now you are informed of the danger, I have no doubt;\r\nbut you may easily avoid it; and yet it was necessary to put you on\r\nyour guard. I return to my text; what do you mean to say?\r\n\r\nIf it is not a banter on Prevan, besides its being very long, it is\r\nnot to me it can be useful; it is in the face of the world you must\r\nmake him ridiculous; and I renew my instances to you on that subject.\r\n\r\nAh! I believe I have discovered the enigma. Your letter is a prophecy;\r\nnot what you will do, but what he will believe you ready to do, at the\r\nmoment of his disgrace. I approve this project well enough; however, it\r\nrequires great management. You know, as well as I do, it is absolutely\r\nthe same thing to the public, whether you are connected with a man, or\r\nreceive his addresses, unless the man is a fool, which Prevan is not\r\nby any means; if he can only save appearances, he will brag, and every\r\nthing will be greedily swallowed. Fools will believe him, others will\r\nseem to believe him; and then what becomes of your resources? I am\r\nreally alarmed; not that I have any doubt of your abilities; but the\r\nbest swimmers are often drowned.\r\n\r\nI think myself no novice in the ways of debauchery. I have discovered\r\na hundred, nay, a thousand. My mind is often engaged in thinking how a\r\nwoman could escape me, and I never could find out the possibility. Even\r\nyourself, my charming friend, whose conduct is a masterpiece; I have\r\noften thought your success was more owing to good fortune than good\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\nAfter all, I am, perhaps, seeking a reason where there is none; and\r\nI am astonished I have been for this hour past treating seriously a\r\nsubject that you certainly mean as a jest. How you will laugh at me!\r\nbut be it so; let us talk of something else. I am wrong; it must be the\r\nsame subject; always of women to be had or ruined, and often of both.\r\n\r\nI have here wherewithal, as you justly remark, to give me employment in\r\nboth capacities, but not with equal facility. I foresee revenge will\r\noutstrip love. The little Volanges is ready, I will answer for her;\r\nall now depends upon the opportunity which I take upon me to provide:\r\nbut not so with Madame de Tourvel; this woman distracts me. I have no\r\nconception of her. I have a hundred proofs of her love; but I have also\r\na thousand of her resistance. Upon my word, I am afraid she will escape\r\nme.\r\n\r\nThe first effect that my return produced gave me more flattering\r\nexpectations. You may guess, I was willing to judge for myself; and\r\nto be certain of seeing her first emotions, I took care not to be\r\nannounced by any formality, calculating my journey so as to arrive\r\nwhile they were at dinner, and fell from the clouds like an opera\r\ndivinity.\r\n\r\nHaving made a sufficient noise coming in to draw their attention to\r\nme, I could observe with the same glance my old aunt’s joy, Madame\r\nde Volanges’ vexation, and the confused pleasure of her daughter. My\r\nfair one sat with her back to the door. Being employed at that instant\r\ncutting up something, she did not even turn her head. I addressed\r\nmyself to Madame de Rosemonde; and at the first word, the tender\r\ndevotee hearing my voice, gave a scream, in which I thought there was\r\nmore of love than surprise or terror. I was then got so far into the\r\nroom as to be able to observe her countenance; the tumult of her soul,\r\nthe struggle of ideas and sentiments, were strongly depicted in twenty\r\ndifferent forms on it. I seated myself at table close by her; she did\r\nnot know what she said or did. She endeavoured to keep on eating; but\r\nit was in vain. At length, in less than a quarter of an hour, her\r\npleasure and her embarrassment overpowering her, she thought it best to\r\nbeg leave to retire from table, under a pretence of wanting a little\r\nair. Madame de Volanges wanted to accompany her; the tender prude would\r\nnot permit it: too happy, doubtless, to find a pretence to be alone,\r\nand give herself up without restraint to the soft emotions of her heart.\r\n\r\nI dispatched my dinner as soon as possible. The dessert was scarcely\r\nserved, when the infernal Volanges, probably with a design to prejudice\r\nme, got up to follow the charming woman. I foresaw this project, but\r\ndisappointed her. I feigned to take this particular motion for a\r\ngeneral one; and rising at the same time, the little Volanges and the\r\ncurate of the place followed our example, so that Madame de Rosemonde\r\nwas left at table with the old Commander de T—, who both also took\r\nthe resolution to follow us. We all went then to join my fair one, whom\r\nwe found in the arbour near the castle; and as she wanted solitude more\r\nthan a walk, she chose rather to return with us, than to oblige us to\r\nstay with her. As soon as I was certain that Madame de Volanges would\r\nnot have an opportunity of speaking to her alone, I began to think of\r\nexecuting your orders, and exert myself for the interest of your pupil.\r\nWhen coffee was over, I went up to my apartment, entered the other’s\r\nto reconnoitre the ground, and formed my dispositions to ensure the\r\ncorrespondence of the little one. After this first step, I wrote a\r\nfew words to inform her of it; and to demand her confidence, I tacked\r\nmy note to Danceny’s letter; returned to the saloon, where I found my\r\nfair one stretched upon a sofa at full length, in a most delicious\r\nabandonment.\r\n\r\nThis sight rousing my desires, animated my looks. I knew they should be\r\ntender, yet urgent; and placed myself in such a manner, as to be able\r\nto employ them successfully. Their first essay obliged my celestial\r\nprude to cast down her beautiful modest eyes. I viewed for some time\r\nthis angelic figure; then running over her whole frame, amused myself\r\nwith considering the outlines and forms of her person through the light\r\ndress she wore. After gazing on her from head to foot, my eyes went\r\nback from the feet to the head—my charming friend, the soft look was\r\nfixed on me, but she instantly cast her eyes down again; being desirous\r\nof bringing them back, I turned my eyes from her. Then was established\r\nbetween us that silent convention, the first treaty of timid lovers,\r\nwho to satisfy the mutual want of seeing each other, permit soft looks\r\nto succeed until they mingle together.\r\n\r\nFully satisfied that my charmer was entirely taken up with this new\r\ndelight, I took upon me to watch for our mutual safety: but when I\r\nwas assured that a pretty lively conversation took off the attention\r\nof the company, I endeavoured to make the eyes freely speak their own\r\nlanguage. At first I darted some glances, but with so much reserve,\r\nthat modesty itself could not be alarmed at it; and to make the lovely\r\ntimid woman easier, I appeared as much embarrassed as she; by little\r\nand little, our eyes accustomed to meet, fixed themselves a little\r\nlonger, and at length did not quit each other; I perceived in hers that\r\nsoft languishing air, happy presage to love and desire: but it was only\r\nfor a moment; and she soon recovered herself; she changed her looks\r\nand position with some confusion.\r\n\r\nAs I determined she should have no doubt of my remarking her different\r\nemotions, I started suddenly, asking her, with a frightened look, if\r\nshe was indisposed. Immediately the company assembled round her. I let\r\nthem all pass before me; and as the little Volanges, who was working\r\ntapestry near a window, took some time in quitting her frame, I seized\r\nthe opportunity to give her Danceny’s letter.\r\n\r\nI was a little distance from her, and threw the letter in her lap.\r\nShe really did not know what to do. You would have laughed to see\r\nher surprise and embarrassment; yet I did not laugh, lest so much\r\nawkwardness should betray us: but a glance and a frown, made her\r\ncomprehend that she was to put it in her pocket.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the day had nothing interesting. What has happened\r\nsince, will, perhaps, bring on events that will please you, at least,\r\nas to what regards your pupil; but it is better to employ one’s time in\r\nexecuting than in relating them: moreover, this is the eighth page I\r\nhave written, and I am a good deal fatigued; so adieu.\r\n\r\nIt will be unnecessary to tell you, that the little thing has answered\r\nDanceny.[1] I have also had a letter from my fair one, to whom I wrote\r\nthe day after my arrival. I send you both letters. You will read them,\r\nor let it alone; for those perpetual tiresome repetitions, of which I\r\nbegin to be disgusted, must be very insipid for a person unconcerned.\r\n\r\nOnce more, adieu! I still love you much: but I beg, if you speak again\r\nof Prevan, that it may be in intelligible language.\r\n\r\n_From the Castle of ——, Sept._ 17, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] This letter was not found.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXVII.\r\n\r\nViscount de Valmont _to the_ Presidente de Tourvel.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom whence proceeds, Madam, the cruel care you take to avoid me? How\r\ndoes it happen, that the most tender eagerness on my part, can only\r\nobtain from you an indifference, that one could scarcely justify to a\r\nman who had even done one an injury? When love recalls me to your feet,\r\nand a happy accident places me beside you, you would rather feign an\r\nindisposition, and alarm your friends, than consent to remain near me.\r\nHow often yesterday did you turn away your eyes from me, to deprive me\r\nof the pleasure of a look; and if, for an instant, I could observe less\r\nseverity in them, it seemed as if you intended not that I should enjoy\r\nit, but that I should feel my loss in being deprived of it.\r\n\r\nThis is, I dare say, a treatment not consistent with love, nor can\r\nit be permitted to friendship; and yet you know that one of those\r\nsentiments animates me, and I thought myself authorised to believe\r\nyou would not refuse me the other. This precious friendship, which\r\nyou undoubtedly thought me worthy of, as you condescended to offer\r\nit, what have I since done to forfeit? Have I prejudiced myself by\r\nmy frankness; and will you punish me for my candour? Are you not, at\r\nleast, afraid of offending the one or the other? For is it not in the\r\nbosom of my friend I deposit the secrets of my heart? Is it not to\r\nher alone I thought myself obliged to refuse conditions which, had I\r\naccepted, would give me an opportunity of breaking them, and, perhaps,\r\nof successfully abusing them? Or would you force me to believe, by so\r\nundeserved a rigour, if I had deceived you, I should have gained more\r\nindulgence?\r\n\r\nI do not repent of a conduct I owe to you and myself: but by what\r\nfatality is it, that every laudable action of mine becomes the signal\r\nof a new misfortune to me?\r\n\r\nAnd after having, by my obedience, merited the only praise you have\r\nvouchsafed to bestow on my conduct, I now, for the first time, lament\r\nthe misfortune of displeasing you. After giving you proofs of my entire\r\nsubmission, by depriving myself of the happiness of seeing you, to\r\nplease your delicacy, you want to break off your correspondence with\r\nme, and take away this feeble amends of a sacrifice you exacted, to\r\ndeprive me of my love, which alone could have given you that right. In\r\nfine, it is after speaking to you with a sincerity which even my love\r\ncould not weaken, you fly from me to-day as a dangerous seductor, whose\r\nperfidiousness was fully proved.\r\n\r\nWill you then never cease being unjust? Inform me, at least, what new\r\nwrongs I have committed, that could cause so much severity; and do not\r\nrefuse to prescribe the orders you would have me follow. Surely it is\r\nnot too much to desire to know, when I engage to execute them.\r\n\r\n_Sept._ 15, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXVIII.\r\n\r\n_The_ Presidente de Tourvel _to the_ Viscount de Valmont.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou seem surprised, Sir, at my behaviour; and, indeed, your style\r\nfalls little short of calling me to account, as if you were authorised\r\nto blame it. I really think I have much more reason for astonishment\r\nand complaint; but since the refusal contained in your last answer,\r\nI have taken my resolution to behave with an indifference that may\r\nnot give any occasion for remarks or reproaches; yet as you ask some\r\neclaircissements which, I thank heaven, I find no difficulty in giving,\r\nI will once more explain myself.\r\n\r\nAny person who should read your letters would think me either unjust\r\nor fantastical. I don’t think I deserve that character; but I am of\r\nopinion, you above all the rest of mankind would be the readiest\r\nto catch at it. You must be sensible, that in putting me under the\r\nnecessity of a justification, you oblige me to recall every thing that\r\nhas passed between us. You imagined you would gain by the scrutiny:\r\nI am inclined to think, I may even stand the test in your opinion;\r\nand perhaps it is the only way to discover which of us has a right to\r\ncomplain.\r\n\r\nTo begin, Sir, from the day of your arrival at this castle. You will\r\nacknowledge, I hope, your character authorised me at least to be upon\r\nthe reserve, and I might, without apprehending the imputation of an\r\nexcess of prudery, have restricted myself to exact politeness. You\r\nyourself would have behaved to me with deference, and only thought\r\nit strange, that a plain woman, so unacquainted with the ways of\r\nthe world, had not sufficient penetration to appreciate your merit;\r\nthat would have been certainly the most prudent method, and which I\r\nwas so much inclined to follow, that I will freely own, when Madame\r\nde Rosemonde came to inform me of your arrival, I had occasion to\r\nrecollect my friendship for her, and hers for you, to conceal my\r\nuneasiness at the unwelcome news.\r\n\r\nI will freely own, at first you exhibited a behaviour much more\r\nfavourable to you than what I had conceived: but you must also\r\nallow, it lasted but a very short time; and that you soon grew tired\r\nof a constraint, for which you did not think yourself sufficiently\r\nindemnified by the advantageous idea I had of you.\r\n\r\nThen taking advantage of my candour and tranquillity, you did not\r\nscruple cherishing sentiments which you could not have the least\r\ndoubt but would offend me; and whilst you was every day multiplying\r\nand aggravating the wrongs you did me, I endeavoured to forget them,\r\nand even offered you an opportunity, in some measure, of redressing\r\nthem. My requisition was so fair, that you even thought you could not\r\nrefuse it, but asserting a right from my indulgence, you made use\r\nof it to demand a permission, which doubtless I ought not to have\r\ngranted, and which yet you obtained. The conditions annexed to it\r\nyou did not observe; your correspondence was such, that each letter\r\nmade it a duty to answer you no more. Even at the very time when your\r\nobstinacy obliged me to insist on your going away, that by a blameable\r\ncondescension I sought the only means which, consistent with duty,\r\nwas allowed me not to break entirely with you. But an humble sentiment\r\nhas no value in your eyes. You despise friendship; and in your mad\r\nintoxication, ridiculing misery and shame, you seek nothing but victims\r\nand pleasure.\r\n\r\nAs fickle in your proceedings, as contrary to your own principles in\r\nyour charges, you forget your promises, or you make a jest of violating\r\nthem; and after consenting to depart from me, you come back without\r\nbeing recalled, without paying the least regard to my solicitations\r\nor my reasons, without even the decency of a notice. You ventured to\r\nexpose me to a surprise, which, although very simple in itself, might\r\nhave been interpreted very unfavourably for me by the persons who\r\nwere present, and, far from endeavouring to dissipate this moment of\r\nembarrassment you gave birth to, you carefully sought to augment it.\r\nAt table you chose precisely to place yourself beside me. A slight\r\nindisposition obliged me to go out before any of the company; and\r\ninstead of paying any respect to my solitude, you bring them all to\r\ndisturb me. Being returned again into the saloon, if I move, you\r\nfollow me; if I speak, you always reply to me. The most indifferent\r\nword is a pretence for you to bring on a conversation, which I do\r\nnot wish to hear, and which often may bring my name in question; for\r\nnotwithstanding all your address, Sir, I believe others can see as well\r\nas me.\r\n\r\nThus, then, reduced to a state of inaction and silence, you\r\nnevertheless continue to pursue me. I cannot lift my eyes without\r\nmeeting yours. I am incessantly obliged to turn my looks from you; and\r\nby an inconsequence, you fix the eyes of the whole company on me, at a\r\ntime when I could even wish to hide myself from my own.\r\n\r\nYet you complain of my behaviour, and are astonished at my anxiety to\r\nfly from you. Blame rather my indulgence, and be astonished I did not\r\nset out the moment you arrived. I ought to have done it; perhaps you\r\nwill yet oblige me to this violent, though necessary measure, if you do\r\nnot cease your offensive pursuits. No; I never will forget what I owe\r\nto myself, what I owe to the obligations I have taken, which I respect\r\nand cherish. Be assured, if I should ever be reduced to the unhappy\r\nchoice of sacrificing myself or them, I would not hesitate a moment.\r\n\r\n_Sept._ 16, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXIX.\r\n\r\n_The_ Viscount de Valmont _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nI thought to have gone a-hunting this morning, but it is most horrible\r\nweather. I have no book to read but a new romance that would tire\r\na boarding-school girl. We shall not breakfast these two hours;\r\ntherefore, notwithstanding my long letter of yesterday, I will still\r\nchat with you, and am confident you will not think me tedious, for I\r\nwill entertain you concerning _the very handsome Prevan_.\r\n\r\nSo you know nothing at all about this famous adventure which separated\r\nthe _inseparables_. I would venture to lay a wager, you will recollect\r\nit at the first word. I will give it you, however, since you desire it.\r\n\r\nYou may remember all Paris was astonished, three women equally\r\nhandsome, equally possessing the same talents, and having the same\r\npretensions, should remain so intimately connected since the time of\r\ntheir appearance in the world. At first it was imagined it proceeded\r\nfrom their great timidity; but soon surrounded by a number of gallants,\r\nwhose homages they shared, they soon began to feel their consequence,\r\nby the eagerness and assiduity with which they were followed. Still\r\ntheir union became the stronger. One would have imagined the triumph\r\nof one was also that of the other two; however, every one flattered\r\nhimself that love would cause a rivalship. Those fair ones contended\r\nfor the honour of the apple of discord; and I myself would have been a\r\ncompetitor, if the high reputation the Countess de —— was in at that\r\ntime would have permitted me to have committed an infidelity before I\r\nhad obtained the consummation of my desires.\r\n\r\nHowever, our three beauties that same carnival made their choice, as if\r\nin concert; and far from exciting any disturbance, it rendered their\r\nfriendship more interesting by the charms of confidence.\r\n\r\nThe crowd of unfortunate pretenders coalesced with the envious women,\r\nand this scandalous constancy was submitted to public censure. Some\r\npromulgated, that in this society of _the inseparables_, so called\r\nat that time, the fundamental law was, that every thing should be\r\nin common, that love even was subservient to the same law. Others\r\nasserted, that the three lovers were not exempt from rivals. Others\r\nwent so far as to say, they had only been admitted for decency sake,\r\nand had only obtained a sinecure title.\r\n\r\nThese reports, whether true or false, had not their wished-for effect;\r\nthe three couple perceived plainly they were undone if they separated\r\nat this period, therefore resolved to stem the torrent. The public, who\r\nsoon tire of every thing, shortly gave up a fruitless scandal. Carried\r\naway by their natural levity, they were engaged in other pursuits.\r\nReturning again to this, with their usual inconsequence, they changed\r\ntheir criticisms to commendations. As every thing is here fashionable,\r\nthe enthusiasm gained ground, and became a perfect rage, when Prevan\r\nundertook to verify those prodigies, and to fix the public opinion and\r\nhis own on them.\r\n\r\nHe then laid himself out for those models of perfection. Being easily\r\nadmitted into their society, from thence he drew a favourable omen;\r\nhe very well knew, those who lived in a happy state were not so\r\naccessible; and soon perceived the so-much-boasted happiness, like\r\nthat of kings, was more envied than desirable. He observed among those\r\npretended inseparables, they began to seek for pleasures abroad, they\r\nwere often absent; from thence he concluded, the ties of love or\r\nfriendship were already relaxed or broken; that those of self-love and\r\nhabit still preserved some kind of strength.\r\n\r\nStill the women, whom necessity kept together, preserved the same\r\nappearance of intimacy among themselves: but the men, more free in\r\ntheir proceedings, found duties to fulfil, or business to do, which\r\nthey always lamented, but nevertheless did not neglect; their meetings\r\nwere thus scarcely ever complete.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour was very useful to the assiduous Prevan, who being,\r\nin course, at liberty with the widow of the day, alternately found\r\nan opportunity of offering the same homage to the three friends. He\r\nreadily saw, if he made a choice, it would be his destruction; the\r\nshame of being discovered to be the first transgressor would deter the\r\none who had the preference, and the vanity of the two others would\r\nrender them mortal enemies of the new lover; they would not fail to\r\ndisplay all their resentment against him, and jealousy would certainly\r\nrecall a rival, who, perhaps, might be troublesome. Thus every thing\r\nwas attended with difficulty: but in his triple project, every thing\r\nwas made easy; each woman was indulgent, because she was interested,\r\nand each man, because he thought he was not.\r\n\r\nPrevan was engaged to only one woman at that time. Fortunately for\r\nhim, the sacrifice was not very difficult, as she became celebrated.\r\nThe addresses of a great prince, which had been dexterously rejected,\r\ntogether with her being a foreigner, had drawn the attention of the\r\ncourt and town upon her. Her lover shared the honour, and made a very\r\ngood use of it with his new mistresses; the only difficulty was,\r\nto carry on those three intrigues in front, whose march should be\r\nregulated by the movements of the slowest: and I have been assured by\r\none of his confidents, that his greatest trouble was to retard one of\r\nthem who was ripe a fortnight before the others.\r\n\r\nAt length the expected day came. Prevan, who had obtained the consent\r\nof them all, regulated their motions in the following manner: One of\r\nthe husbands was absent, another was to go on a journey early the\r\nnext morning, the third remained in town. The inseparable friends\r\nhad agreed to sup with the future widow; but the new master would not\r\nsuffer any of the old servants to be invited. The morning of the same\r\nday, he divided into three lots the fair foreigner’s letters. In the\r\none he enclosed her picture; in the second, an amorous cypher she\r\nherself had drawn; the third enclosed a lock of her hair. Each received\r\nher share of sacrifice, and, in return, consented to send to their\r\ndiscarded lovers, letters of dismission.\r\n\r\nThat was doing a great deal; but yet was not enough. She whose husband\r\nwas in town, was at liberty during the day only; and it was agreed,\r\nthat a feigned indisposition should prevent her from supping with her\r\nfriend, but the evening should be dedicated to Prevan; the night was\r\ngranted by her whose husband was out of town; and day-light, the time\r\nthe third husband was to set off, was the happy moment allotted for\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nPrevan, who neglects nothing, flies to the fair foreigner’s in an ill\r\nhumour, which soon spread, and leaves her, after an altercation which\r\nbrought on a quarrel that ensured him leave of absence for twenty-four\r\nhours at least. His dispositions thus made, he returned home, to take\r\nsome repose; but other affairs awaited him.\r\n\r\nThe letters of dismission had opened the eyes of the discarded lovers;\r\nnone of them had the least doubt but that he was sacrificed to Prevan:\r\nand the vexation of being tricked, with the mortification of being\r\ndiscarded, they all three, as if in concert, but without communicating\r\nwith each other, resolved to have satisfaction, and demanded it\r\naccordingly of their fortunate rival.\r\n\r\nSo that at his arrival he found three challenges, which he nobly\r\naccepted: but unwilling to lose the pleasure or reputation of this\r\nadventure, he fixed the meeting for the next morning, all three at the\r\nsame hour and place, at one of the gates of the wood of Boulogne.\r\n\r\nNight being come, he run his triple career with equal success; at\r\nleast, he has since vaunted, that each of his new mistresses had\r\nreceived three times the pledges of his love. Here, as you may well\r\nimagine, the proofs are deficient. All that can be required from the\r\nimpartial historian is to request the incredulous reader to remark,\r\nthat vanity, and an exalted imagination can bring forth prodigies.\r\nMoreover, the morning that was to follow so brilliant a night, seemed\r\nto excuse circumspection for the events of the day. The following facts\r\nhave, however, a greater degree of certainty.\r\n\r\nPrevan came punctually to the place appointed, where he found his\r\nthree rivals, who were a little surprised at meeting each other, and\r\nperhaps, partly consoled on seeing the companions of their misfortunes.\r\nHe accosted them with an affable and cavalier air, and made them the\r\nfollowing speech, which has been faithfully related to me:\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” said he, “meeting here together, you certainly guess that\r\nyou have all the same subject of complaint against me. I am ready to\r\ngive you satisfaction: but let chance decide between you, which of you\r\nthree will be the first to require a satisfaction that you have all\r\nan equal right to. I have brought neither witness nor second. I had\r\nnot any in the commission of the offence: I do not require any in the\r\nreparation.” Then, agreeable to his character of a gamester, “I know,”\r\nsays he, “one seldom holds in three hands running; but be my fate what\r\nit will, the man has lived long enough who has gained the love of the\r\nwomen and the esteem of the men.”\r\n\r\nWhilst his adversaries, astonished, silently looked on each other, and,\r\nperhaps, hurt at the indelicacy of this triple combat, which made the\r\nparty very unequal, Prevan resumed, “I will not conceal from you, that\r\nlast night has been a very fatiguing one. It would be but generous to\r\ngive me time to recruit. I have given order to prepare a breakfast;\r\ndo me the honour to accept of it. Let us breakfast together with good\r\nhumour. One may fight for such trifles; but I don’t think it should\r\nhave any effect on our spirits.”\r\n\r\nThe breakfast was accepted. It is said, Prevan never shone more.\r\nHe not only had the address not to mortify his rivals, but even to\r\npersuade them, they all would have easily had the same success; and\r\nmade them agree, that none would have let slip the opportunity no more\r\nthan himself. Those facts being acknowledged, the matter was entirely\r\nsettled; and before breakfast was over, they often repeated, that such\r\nwomen did not deserve that men of honour should quarrel about them.\r\nThis idea brought on cordiality; the wine strengthened it; so that in a\r\nshort time afterwards, an unreserved friendship succeeded rancour.\r\n\r\nPrevan, who doubtless liked this denouement as well as the other,\r\nwould not, however, lose his celebrity; and dexterously forming his\r\nprojects to circumstances, “Really,” says he, “it is not of me, but\r\nof your faithless mistresses you should be revenged, and I will give\r\nyou the opportunity. I already feel, as you do, an injury, which I\r\nshall soon share with you; for if neither of you have been able to fix\r\nthe constancy of one, how can I expect that I can fix them all? Your\r\nquarrel then becomes my own. If you will sup with me to-night at my\r\nvilla, I hope to give you your revenge.” They desired an explanation:\r\nbut he answered with that tone of superiority, which the circumstances\r\nauthorised him to take, “Gentlemen, I think I have already sufficiently\r\nshown you, that I know how to conduct matters; leave every thing to\r\nme.” They all agreed; and having took leave of their new friend,\r\nseparated until evening, to wait the effect of his promises.\r\n\r\nHe returned immediately to Paris, and, according to custom, waited on\r\nhis new conquests; obtained a promise from each to take a tête-à-tête\r\nsupper with him at his villa. Two of them started some small\r\ndifficulties, but nothing was to be refused after such a night. He made\r\nhis appointments at an hour’s distance from each other, to give him the\r\ntime necessary for the maturing his scheme. After these preparations,\r\nhe gave notice to the other conspirators, and they all impatiently\r\nexpected their victims.\r\n\r\nThe first being arrived, Prevan alone received her, and with a seeming\r\neagerness led her to the sanctuary, of which she imagined herself\r\nthe goddess; then retiring on some slight pretence, was immediately\r\nreplaced by the insulted lover.\r\n\r\nYou may guess the confusion. A woman who was not accustomed to\r\nadventures of this sort, rendered the triumph very easy. Every reproach\r\nthat was omitted, was looked on as a favour; and the fugitive slave,\r\nagain delivered to her first master, thought herself happy in the hope\r\nof pardon on resuming her chains. The treaty of peace was ratified in a\r\nmore solitary place; and the void scene was alternately replaced by the\r\nother actors in pretty much the same manner, but with the same finale.\r\n\r\nStill each of the women thought herself _sola_ in this play. Their\r\nastonishment is not to be described, when, called to supper, the three\r\ncouple reunited: but their confusion was at the summit, when Prevan\r\nmade his appearance, and had the barbarity to make apologies to the\r\nladies, which, by disclosing their secrets, convinced them fully how\r\nmuch they had been tricked.\r\n\r\nThey sat down, however, to table, and recovering from their confusion,\r\nthe men gave themselves up to mirth, and the women yielded. It is\r\ntrue, their hearts were all full of rancour; but yet the conversation\r\nwas nevertheless amorous; gaiety kindled desire, which brought\r\nadditional charms; and this astonishing revel lasted till morning. At\r\nparting, the women had reason to think themselves forgiven: but the\r\nmen, who preserved their resentment, entirely broke off the connection\r\nthe next day; and not satisfied with having abandoned their fickle\r\nladies, in revenge, published the adventure. Since, one has been shut\r\nup in a convent, and the other two are exiled to their estates in the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThus you have heard Prevan’s history. And now I leave you to determine\r\nwhether you will add to his fame, and be yoked to his triumphal chariot\r\nYour letter has made me really uneasy; and I wait with the utmost\r\nimpatience a more explicit and prudent answer to my last.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my lovely friend! Be diffident of whimsical or pleasing ideas,\r\nwhich you are rather apt to be readily seduced by. Remember, that\r\nin the course you run, wit alone is not sufficient: that one single\r\nimprudent step becomes an irremediable evil: and permit prudent\r\nfriendship to sometimes guide your pleasures.\r\n\r\nAdieu! I love you notwithstanding, as much as if you was rational.\r\n\r\n_Sept._ 18, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXX.\r\n\r\nChevalier Danceny _to_ Cecilia Volanges.\r\n\r\n\r\nCecilia, my dear Cecilia! when shall we see each other again? How shall\r\nI live without you? Where shall I find strength or resolution? No,\r\nnever, never, shall I be able to bear this cruel absence. Each day adds\r\nto my misery, without the least prospect of its having an end. Valmont,\r\nwho had promised me assistance and consolation; Valmont neglects, and,\r\nperhaps, forgets me. He is with his love, and no longer acquainted\r\nwith the sufferings of absence. He has not wrote to me, although he\r\nforwarded me the last letter; and yet it is on him I depend to know\r\nwhen and by what means I shall have the happiness to see you. He, then,\r\ncan say nothing. You even do not mention a syllable about it. Surely it\r\ncannot be, that you no longer wish for it. Ah, my Cecilia! I am very\r\nunhappy. I love you more than ever: but this passion, which was the\r\ndelight of my life, is now become my torment.\r\n\r\nNo, I will no longer live thus. I must see you, if it was but for a\r\nmoment. When I rise, I say to myself I shall see her no more. Going\r\nto bed, I say, I have not seen her: and notwithstanding the length\r\nof the days, not a moment of happiness for me. All is grief, all is\r\ndespair; and all those miseries arrive from whence I expected all my\r\njoys. You will have an idea of my situation, if you add to all this, my\r\nuneasiness on your account. I am incessantly thinking of you; and ever\r\nwith grief. If I see you unhappy and afflicted, I bear a part in your\r\nmisfortunes; if I see you in tranquillity and consoled, my griefs are\r\nredoubled. Everywhere and in every circumstance am I miserable.\r\n\r\nAh! it was not thus when you were here; every thing was then delight:\r\nthe certainty of seeing you made absence supportable. You knew how I\r\nemployed my time. If I fulfilled any duties, they rendered me more\r\nworthy of you; if I cultivated any science, it was in hopes to be\r\nmore pleasing to you, whenever the distractions of the world drew me\r\nfrom you. At the opera, I sought to discover what would please you. A\r\nconcert recalled to my mind your talents, and our pleasing occupations\r\nin company. In my walks, I eagerly sought the most slight resemblance\r\nof you. I compared you to all wherever you had the advantage. Every\r\nmoment of the day was distinguished by a new homage, and each evening\r\nlaid the tribute at your feet.\r\n\r\nWhat is now left me? Melancholy grief, and the slight hope which\r\nValmont’s silence diminishes, and yours converts into uneasiness.\r\nTen leagues only separate us: and yet this short space becomes an\r\ninsurmountable obstacle to me; and when I implore the assistance of my\r\nfriend and of my love, both are cold and silent; far from assisting,\r\nthey will not even answer me.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is become of the active friendship of Valmont? But what is\r\nbecome of the tender sentiments which inspired you with that readiness\r\nof finding out means of daily seeing each other? I remember, sometimes\r\nI found myself obliged to sacrifice them to considerations and to\r\nduties. What did you then not say to me? By how many pretexts did you\r\nnot combat my reasons? I beg you will remember, my Cecilia, that my\r\nreasons always gave way to your wishes. I do not pretend to make any\r\nmerit of it. What you wished to obtain, I was impatient to grant; but\r\nI, in turn, now make a request; and what is that request? Only to see\r\nyou a moment; to renew, to receive the assurance of eternal love. Is\r\nit not, then, any longer your happiness as well as mine? I reject this\r\ndesponding idea, which is the summit of misery. You love me; yes, you\r\nwill always love me. I believe it; I am sure of it; and I shall never\r\ndoubt it: but my situation is dreadful, and I can no longer support it.\r\nAdieu, Cecilia!.\r\n\r\n_Sept._ 18, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXI.\r\n\r\n_The_ Marchioness de Merteuil _to the_ Viscount de Valmont.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow your fears raise my compassion! How much they convince me of my\r\nsuperiority over you! So you want to teach me how to conduct myself!\r\nAh, my poor Valmont! what a distance there is still between you and me!\r\nNo; all the pride of your sex would not be sufficient to fill up the\r\ninterval that is between us. Because you are not able to execute my\r\nschemes, you look upon them as impossible. It well becomes you, who are\r\nboth proud and weak, to attempt to decide on my measures, and give your\r\nopinion of my resources. Upon my word, Viscount, your advice has put\r\nme out of temper. I cannot conceal it.\r\n\r\nThat to hide your incredible awkwardness with your Presidente, you\r\nshould display as a triumph the having disconcerted for a moment this\r\nweak woman who loves you, I am not displeased. That you should have\r\nobtained from her a look, I smile, and pass over. That feeling, in\r\nspite of you, the insignificancy of your conduct, you should hope to\r\ndeceive my attention, by flattering me with the sublime effort you have\r\nmade to bring together two children, who are eager to see each other,\r\nand who, I will take upon me to say, are indebted to me only for this\r\neagerness; that I will also pass over. That, lastly, you should plume\r\nyourself on those brilliant acts, to tell me in a magisterial tone,\r\nthat _it is better employ one’s time in executing their projects than\r\nin relating them;_ that vanity hurts me not; I forgive it. But that\r\nyou should take upon you to imagine I stand in need of your prudence;\r\nI should go astray, if I did not pay a proper regard to your advice;\r\nthat I ought to sacrifice a whim, or a pleasure, to it: upon my word,\r\nViscount, that would be raising your pride too much for the confidence\r\nwhich I have condescended to place in you.\r\n\r\nWhat have you then done, that I have not surpassed by a million of\r\ndegrees? You have seduced, ruined several women: but what difficulties\r\nhad you to encounter? What obstacles to surmount? Where is the merit\r\nthat may be truly called yours? A handsome figure, the effect of\r\nmere chance; a gracefulness, which custom generally gives; some wit,\r\nit’s true, but which nonsense would upon occasion supply as well; a\r\ntolerable share of impudence, which is solely owing to the facility of\r\nyour first successes. Those, I believe, are all your abilities, if I am\r\nnot mistaken; for as to the celebrity which you have acquired, you will\r\nnot insist, I presume, that I should set any great value on the art of\r\npublishing or seizing an opportunity of scandal.\r\n\r\nAs to your prudence and cunning, I do not speak of myself, but where is\r\nthe woman that has not more of it than you? Your very Presidente leads\r\nyou like a babe.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, Viscount, one seldom acquires the qualities one thinks\r\nunnecessary. As you engage without danger, you should act without\r\nprecaution. As for you men, your defeats are only a success the less.\r\nIn this unequal struggle, our good fortune is not to be losers; and\r\nyour misfortune, not to be gainers. When I would even grant you equal\r\ntalents with us, how much more must we surpass you by the necessity we\r\nare under of employing them continually?\r\n\r\nLet us suppose, that you make use of as much address to overcome us, as\r\nwe do to defend ourselves, or to surrender; you will, at least, agree\r\nwith me, it becomes useless after you succeed. Entirely taken up with\r\nsome new inclination, you give way to it without fear, without reserve;\r\nits duration is a matter of no consequence to you.\r\n\r\nAnd really those reciprocal attachments, given and received, to speak\r\nin the love cant, you alone have it in your power to keep or break.\r\nHappy yet do the women think themselves, when in your fickleness\r\nyou prefer secrecy to scandal, or are satisfied with a mortifying\r\nabandonment, and that you do not make the idol of to-day the victim of\r\nto-morrow.\r\n\r\nBut if an unfortunate woman should first feel the weight of her chains,\r\nwhat risks does she not run if she attempts to extricate herself\r\nfrom them, if she should dare to struggle against them? She trembling\r\nstrives to put away the man her heart detests. If he persists, what\r\nwas granted to love must be given to fear; her arms are open, while\r\nher heart is shut; her prudence should untie with dexterity those same\r\nbonds you would have broken. She is without resource, at the mercy of\r\nher enemy, if he is incapable of generosity, which is seldom to be met\r\nwith in him; for if he is sometimes applauded for possessing it, he is\r\nnever blamed for wanting it.\r\n\r\nYou will not, doubtless, deny those self-evident propositions. If,\r\nhowever, you have seen me disposing of opinions and events; subjecting\r\nthose formidable men to my whims and fancies; taking from the one\r\nthe will, and from the other the power, of annoying me. If I have\r\ndiscovered the secret, according to my roving taste, to detach the\r\none, and reject the other, those dethroned tyrants becoming my slaves;\r\nif in the midst of those frequent revolutions, my reputation has been\r\nstill preserved unsullied; should you not from thence have concluded,\r\nthat, born to revenge my sex and command yours, I found out means\r\nunknown to any that went before me.\r\n\r\nAh, keep your advice and your fears for those infatuated women, who\r\ncall themselves sentimental; whose exalted imaginations would make\r\none believe, that Nature had placed their senses in their heads; who,\r\nhaving never reflected, blend incessantly the lover with love; who,\r\npossessed with that ridiculous illusion, believe that he alone with\r\nwhom they have sought pleasure is the sole trustee of it, and, true to\r\nenthusiasm, have the same respect and faith for the priest that is due\r\nto the Divinity only.\r\n\r\nReserve your fears for those who, more vain than prudent, do not know\r\nwhen to consent or break off.\r\n\r\nBut tremble for those active, yet idle women, whom you call\r\n_sentimental_, on whom love so easily and powerfully takes possession;\r\nwho feel the necessity of being taken up with it, even when they don’t\r\nenjoy it; and, giving themselves up without reserve to the fermentation\r\nof their ideas, bring forth those soft but dangerous letters, and do\r\nnot dread confiding in the object that causes them these proofs of\r\ntheir weakness; imprudent creatures! who in their actual lover cannot\r\nsee their future enemy.\r\n\r\nBut what have I to do in common with those inconsiderate women? When\r\nhave you seen me depart from the rules I have laid down to myself, and\r\nabandon my own principles? I say, my own principles, and I speak it\r\nwith energy, for they are not like those of other women, dealt out by\r\nchance, received without scrutiny, and followed through custom; they\r\nare the proofs of my profound reflections; I have given them existence,\r\nand I can call them my own work.\r\n\r\nIntroduced into the world whilst yet a girl, I was devoted by my\r\nsituation to silence and inaction; this time I made use of for\r\nreflection and observation. Looked upon as thoughtless and heedless,\r\npaying little attention to the discourses that were held out to me, I\r\ncarefully laid up those that were meant to be concealed from me.\r\n\r\nThis useful curiosity served me in the double capacity of instruction\r\nand dissimulation. Being often obliged to hide the objects of my\r\nattention from the eyes of those who surrounded me, I endeavoured to\r\nguide my own at my will. I then learnt to take up at pleasure that\r\ndissipated air which you have so often praised. Encouraged by those\r\nfirst successes, I endeavoured to regulate in the same manner the\r\ndifferent motions of my person. Did I feel any chagrin, I endeavoured\r\nto put on an air of serenity, and even an affected cheerfulness;\r\ncarried my zeal so far, that I used to put myself to voluntary pain;\r\nand tried my temper, by seeming to express a satisfaction; laboured\r\nwith the same care and trouble to repress the sudden tumult of\r\nunexpected joy. It is thus that I gained that ascendancy over my\r\ncountenance which has so often astonished you.\r\n\r\nI was yet very young and unconcerned, but still reflected. My thoughts\r\nwere my own, and I was exasperated to have them either surprised or\r\ndrawn from me against my will. Provided with such arms, I immediately\r\nbegan to try their utility. Not satisfied with the closeness of my\r\ncharacter, I amused myself with assuming different ones. Confident\r\nof my actions, I studied my words; I regulated the one and the other\r\naccording to circumstances, and sometimes according to whim. From that\r\nmoment I became selfish; and no longer showed any desire, but what I\r\nthought useful to me.\r\n\r\nThis labour had so far fixed my attention on the characters of the\r\nphysiognomy, and the expression of the countenance, that I acquired the\r\npenetrating glance, which experience, however, has taught me not to\r\nplace an entire confidence in, but which has so seldom deceived me.\r\n\r\nI had scarce attained my fifteenth year, when I was mistress of those\r\ntalents to which the greatest part of our female politicians owe their\r\nreputation, and had only attained the first rudiments of the science I\r\nwas so anxious to acquire.\r\n\r\nYou may well imagine, that like all other young girls, I wanted to be\r\nacquainted with love and pleasure: but never having been in a convent,\r\nhaving no confidant, and being moreover strictly watched by a vigilant\r\nmother, I had only vague ideas. Nature even, which certainly I have\r\nhad since every reason to be satisfied with, had not yet given me any\r\nindication. I may say, she silently wrought to perfect her work. My\r\nhead alone fermented. I did not wish for enjoyment; I wanted knowledge:\r\nmy strong propensity for instruction suggested the means.\r\n\r\nI was sensible, the only man I could apply to on this occasion without\r\ndanger was my confessor. As soon as I was determined, I got the better\r\nof my bashfulness. I accused myself of a fault I had not committed, and\r\ndeclared I had done _all that women do_. Those were the exact words:\r\nbut when I spoke thus, I really had no idea of what I expressed.\r\nMy expectations were neither entirely satisfied, nor altogether\r\ndisappointed; the dread of discovering myself prevented my information:\r\nbut the good father made the crime so heinous, that I concluded the\r\npleasure must be excessive; and the desire of tasting it succeeded that\r\nof knowing it.\r\n\r\nI don’t know how far this desire might have carried me; being then\r\ntotally unexperienced, the first opportunity would have probably ruined\r\nme: but fortunately a few days after my mother informed me that I was\r\nto be married. Immediately the certainty of coming to the knowledge\r\nof every thing stifled my curiosity, and I came a virgin to Mr. de\r\nMerteuil’s arms.\r\n\r\nI waited with unconcern the period that was to resolve my doubts; and I\r\nhad occasion for reflection, to assume a little fear and embarrassment.\r\nThis first night, which generally fills the mind with so much joy or\r\napprehension, offered me only an opportunity of experience, pleasure,\r\nand pain. I observed every thing with the utmost exactitude, and those\r\ndifferent sensations furnished matter for reflection.\r\n\r\nThis kind of study soon began to be pleasing: but faithful to my\r\nprinciples, and knowing, as it were, by instinct, that no one ought to\r\nbe less in my confidence than my husband, I determined, for no other\r\nreason than because I had my feeling, to appear to him impassible. This\r\naffected coldness laid the foundation for that blind confidence which\r\nhe ever after placed in me: and in consequence of more reflection, I\r\nthrew in an air of dissipation over my behaviour, to which my youth\r\ngave a sanction; and I never appeared more childish than when I praised\r\nhim most profusely.\r\n\r\nYet, I must own, at first I suffered myself to be hurried away by the\r\nbustle of the world, and gave myself up entirely to its most trifling\r\ndissipations. After a few months M. de Merteuil having brought me to\r\nhis dreary country house, to avoid the dulness of a rural life, I again\r\nresumed my studies; and being surrounded by people whose inferiority\r\nsheltered me from suspicion, I gave myself a loose in order to improve\r\nmy experience. It was then I was ascertained that love, which is\r\nrepresented as the first cause of all our pleasure, is at most but the\r\npretence.\r\n\r\nM. de Merteuil’s sickness interrupted those pleasing occupations. I\r\nwas obliged to accompany him to town, where he went for advice. He\r\ndied a short time after, as you know; and though, to take all in all,\r\nI had no reason to complain of him, nevertheless I was very sensibly\r\naffected with the liberty my widowhood gave me, which had so pleasing\r\na prospect.\r\n\r\nMy mother imagined that I would go into a convent, or would go back to\r\nlive with her: I refused both one and the other: the only sacrifice\r\nI made to decency was to return to the country, where I had yet some\r\nobservations to make.\r\n\r\nI strengthened them by reading, but don’t imagine that it was all of\r\nthat kind you suppose: I studied my morals in romances, my opinions\r\namongst the philosophers, and even sought amongst our most severe\r\nmoralists, what was required of us.—Thus I was ascertained of what\r\none might do, how one ought to think, and the character one should\r\nassume. Thus fixed on those three objects, the last only offered some\r\ndifficulties in the execution: I hoped to conquer them; I ruminated on\r\nthe means.\r\n\r\nI began to be disgusted with my rustic pleasures; they were not\r\nsufficiently variegated for my active mind, and felt the necessity of\r\ncoquetry to reconcile me to love; not really to be sensible of it, but\r\nto feign it, and inspire it in others. In vain I have been told, and\r\nhad read, that this passion was not to be feigned. I saw clearly, that\r\nto acquire it, it was sufficient to blend the spirit of an author with\r\nthe talent of a comedian. I practised those two characters, and perhaps\r\nwith some success; but, instead of courting the vain applause of the\r\ntheatre, I determined to turn what so many others sacrificed to vanity,\r\nto my own happiness.\r\n\r\nA year was spent in those different employments. My mourning being\r\nexpired, I returned to town with my grand projects, but did not expect\r\nthe first obstacle which fell in my way.\r\n\r\nThe austere retreat and long solitude I had been accustomed to, had\r\ngiven me such an air of prudery as frightened our prettiest fellows,\r\nand left me a prey to a crowd of tiresome gallants, who all made\r\npretensions to my person; the difficulty was, not to refuse them; but\r\nseveral of those refusals were not agreeable to my family: I lost in\r\nthose domestic broils the time which I flattered myself to make so\r\ncharming a use. I was obliged then to recall the one, and disperse the\r\nothers, to be guilty of some frivolities, and to take the same pains to\r\nhurt my reputation that I had taken to preserve it. In this I easily\r\nsucceeded, as you may very well imagine; but, not being swayed by any\r\npassion, I only did what I judged necessary, and dealt out prudently\r\nsome little acts of volatility.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I had accomplished my aim, I stopped short, gave the credit\r\nof my reformation to some women, who not having any pretensions to\r\nbeauty or attractions, wrapt themselves up in merit and virtue. This\r\nresolution was of great importance, and turned out better than I could\r\nhave expected; those grateful duennas became my apologists, and their\r\nblind zeal for what they called their own work, was carried to such a\r\nlength, that upon the least conversation that was held about me, the\r\nwhole prude party exclaimed shame and scandal! The same means acquired\r\nme also the good opinion of our women of talents, who, convinced that I\r\ndid not pursue the same objects they did, chose me for the subject of\r\ntheir praise, whenever they asserted they did not scandalize every body.\r\n\r\nHowever, my former conduct brought back the lovers; to keep the balance\r\neven between them and my new female friends, I exhibited myself as\r\na woman not averse to love, but difficult, and whom the excess of\r\ndelicacy rendered superior to love.\r\n\r\nThen I began to display upon the grand theatre the talents I had\r\nacquired: my first care was to acquire the name of invincible; in\r\norder to obtain it, the men who were not pleasing to me were the only\r\nones whose addresses I seemed to accept. I employed them usefully in\r\nprocuring me the honours of resistance, whilst I gave myself up without\r\ndread to the favoured lover; but my assumed timidity never permitted\r\nhim to appear with me in public company, whose attention was always\r\nthus drawn off to the unfortunate lover.\r\n\r\nYou know how expeditious I am in my decisions; this proceeds from my\r\nobservation, that it is always the preparatory steps which betray\r\nwomen’s secrets. Let one do what they will, the _ton_ is never the\r\nsame before as after success. This difference does not escape the\r\nattentive observer; and I have found it always less dangerous to be\r\nmistaken in my choice, than to suffer myself to be seen through; I\r\nmoreover gain by this conduct, to remove probabilities on which only a\r\njudgment may be formed.\r\n\r\nThose precautions, and that of never corresponding, to give any proof\r\nof my defeat, may appear satisfactory; however, I never thought them\r\nsufficient. Examining my own heart, I studied that of others; then\r\nI found, there is no person whatever who has not a secret that it\r\nis important should not be revealed; an established truth of which\r\nantiquity seems to have been more sensible than we are, and of which,\r\nperhaps, the history of Samson may have been an ingenious emblem.\r\nLike another Dalilah, I always employed my power in discovering this\r\nimportant secret. Ah! how many of our modern Samsons do I not hold by\r\nthe hair under my scissars! Those I have no dread of; they are the\r\nonly ones that I sometimes take a pleasure in mortifying. More pliant\r\nwith others, I endeavour to render them fickle, to avoid appearing\r\ninconstant myself. A feigned friendship, an apparent confidence, some\r\ngenerous dealings, the flattering idea that each was possessed with, of\r\nbeing my only lover, has secured discretion; in short, when all those\r\nmeans have failed, I have known how to stifle beforehand, (foreseeing\r\nmy rapture), under the cloak of ridicule and calumny, the credit those\r\ndangerous men might obtain.\r\n\r\nWhat I now tell you, you have often seen me put in practice; and yet\r\nyou call my prudence in question! Don’t you recollect, when you first\r\nbegan your courtship to me? I never was more flattered; I sighed for\r\nyou before I saw you. Captivated by your reputation, you seemed to\r\nbe wanting to my glory; I burned with the desire of encountering you\r\nface to face; it was the only one of my inclinations that ever took\r\na moment’s ascendancy over me; yet, had you been inclined to ruin\r\nme, what means had you in your power? Idle conversations that leave\r\nno traces after them, that your reputation even would have rendered\r\nsuspicious, and a set of facts without probability, the sincere recital\r\nof which would have had the appearance of a romance badly assimilated.\r\nIt is true, you have since been in possession of all my secrets; but\r\nyou are sensible how our interests are united, and which of us two\r\nought to be taxed with imprudence.[1]\r\n\r\nSince I am in the humour of giving you an account of myself, I will do\r\nit with the utmost exactitude.—I think I hear you say I’m at least at\r\nthe mercy of my chambermaid! Truly, if she is not in the secret of my\r\nsentiments, she is at least in that of my actions. When you spoke to me\r\non this subject formerly, I only answered you, I was sure of her; the\r\nproof this answer was then sufficient to make you easy, is, you have\r\nsince confided in her, and for your own account; but now Prevan gives\r\nyou umbrage, that your head is turned, I doubt much you’ll not take my\r\nword: you must, then, be edified.\r\n\r\nFirst, this girl is my foster-sister; this tie, which appears nothing\r\nto us, has a great influence with people of her condition: moreover, I\r\nam in possession of her secrets; she is the victim of a love intrigue,\r\nand would have been ruined if I had not saved her. Her parents, armed\r\nat all points with sentiments of honour, wanted to have her shut\r\nup: they applied to me about it; I instantly saw how useful their\r\nresentment might be to me, and seconded their intentions; solicited the\r\norder from court, which I obtained; then suddenly, preferring clemency,\r\nbrought her parents round, employing my credit with the old minister of\r\nstate, and prevailed on them to depute me the trustee in this business,\r\nto stop or demand the execution of it, according as I should think the\r\nbehaviour of the girl would deserve. She knows, then, her fate rests\r\nin my hands; and if, which is impossible, those powerful motives would\r\nnot prevent, is it not evident, that her conduct being laid open, and\r\nher punishment authenticated, it would soon wipe away all credit to her\r\ntale?\r\n\r\nAdd to all these precautions, which I call fundamental ones, a thousand\r\nothers, either local or eventual, that reflection and habitude would\r\nproduce, if needful, the detail of which would be too minute, but the\r\npractice very important, and which you must take the trouble to collect\r\nin the whole of my conduct, if you want to arrive at the knowledge of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBut to pretend that I, who have taken so much pains, should not receive\r\nany benefit, after having raised myself so much above other women by my\r\nassiduous labours;—that I should consent to creep, like them, between\r\nimprudence and timidity; but, above all, I should dread a man so far as\r\nto find my salvation only in flight. No, Viscount; I must conquer or\r\nperish. As to Prevan, I must and will have him. He will tell, you say:\r\nbut he shall not tell. This, in a few words, is our romance.\r\n\r\n_Sept._ 20, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Hereafter will be seen, in the 152d Letter, not Mr. de Valmont’s\r\nsecret, but pretty nearly of what kind it was; and the reader will\r\nperceive, that we could throw no more light on that subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXII.\r\n\r\nCecilia Volanges _to the_ Chevalier Danceny.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy God! what trouble your letter gives me! I had great reason, to be\r\nsure, to be impatient to receive it. I expected to have received some\r\nconsolation, and am now more afflicted than ever. I could not help\r\ncrying when I read it. But that is not what I reproach you with; for I\r\nhave often cried already upon your account, without giving me so much\r\ntrouble: but now the case is altered.\r\n\r\nWhat is it, then, you mean to say? That your love is now a torment\r\nto you; that you can’t live any longer thus, nor bear to be so\r\ncircumstanced? What! will you cease loving me, because it is not quite\r\nso easy to see me as formerly? Don’t think I am happier than you;\r\non the contrary: but I love you the more notwithstanding. If Mr. de\r\nValmont has not wrote to you, it is not my fault. I could not prevail\r\non him; because I have never been alone with him; we have agreed never\r\nto speak to one another before company; and all upon your account, that\r\nhe may the sooner do what you would have him. I don’t say, but what I\r\nwish it as well as you; and you ought to be very sure of it: but what\r\nwould you have me do? If you think it is so easy, find out the way; it\r\nis what I wish for as much as you do.\r\n\r\nDo you think it so pleasing to be scolded every day by mamma? She who\r\nbefore never said any thing to me, now it is worse than if I was in a\r\nconvent. I used to be consoled thinking it was for you; even sometimes,\r\nI was very glad of it. Now I perceive you are vexed without my giving\r\nany occasion for it. I am more melancholy than for any thing that has\r\nhappened till now.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more difficult than to receive your letters; so that\r\nif Mr. de Valmont was not so complaisant and dexterous as he is, I\r\nshould not know what to do; and it is still more difficult to write to\r\nyou. In the morning I dare not, because my mamma is always near me,\r\nand comes every moment into my chamber. Sometimes I can do it in the\r\nafternoon, under pretence of singing or playing on the harp. I must\r\nstop at the end of every line, that they may hear me play. Fortunately\r\nmy chambermaid falls asleep sometimes at night, and I tell her I can go\r\nto bed very well alone; that she may go, and leave me the candle; I am\r\nsometimes obliged to hide behind the curtain, that no one may see the\r\nlight, and listen; for, on the least noise, I hide every thing in my\r\nbed, lest any one should come. I wish you were only here to see: you\r\nwould be convinced one must have a great affection to do all this. In\r\nshort, you may depend I do every thing in my power.\r\n\r\nI can’t help telling you I love you, and will always love you. I never\r\ntold you so with more sincerity, yet you are angry. You assure me,\r\nhowever, before I told you so, that it would be enough to make you\r\nhappy; you can’t deny it, for it is in your letters: although I have\r\nthem no longer, I remember it as well as when I used to read them every\r\nday; and because we are now absent, you have altered your mind; but\r\nthis absence will not last for ever, perhaps. Good God! how unhappy I\r\nam; and you are the cause of it all.\r\n\r\nNow I think of it, about your letters; I hope you have kept all those\r\nthat mamma took from me, and that she sent you back. Surely the time\r\nwill come, when I shan’t be so closely watched as I am at present, and\r\nyou will give them to me again. How happy shall I be, when I can keep\r\nthem always, without any one prying into them.—Now, I return them back\r\nto Mr. de Valmont, as it would otherwise be running too great a risk,\r\nand yet I never return any but it gives me a great deal of trouble.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear friend! I love you with all my heart, and I will love\r\nyou all my life. I hope now you will not be vexed any more; if I was\r\nsure of it, I would not be so myself. Write to me as soon as you can,\r\nfor I find that until then I shall be always uneasy.\r\n\r\n_From the Castle of ——, Sept._ 21, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXIII.\r\n\r\nViscount de Valmont, _to the_ Presidente de Tourvel.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor heaven’s sake, Madam, let us renew the conversation so\r\nunfortunately interrupted, that I may convince you how different I am\r\nfrom the odious picture that has been drawn of me, and may, at least,\r\nenjoy that amiable confidence you placed in me. How many charms do\r\nyou not add to virtue! How you embellish and make us cherish virtuous\r\nsentiments! It is there you are truly enchanting; that is the strongest\r\nof all seductions; it is the only one which is truly respectable and\r\npowerful.\r\n\r\nIt is enough to see you, to wish to please you; and to converse with\r\nyou, to augment this wish: but he that has the happiness to know you,\r\nwho can sometimes read your mind, soon gives way to a more noble\r\nenthusiasm, and, struck with veneration as with love—in your person\r\nadores the image of all the virtues. Formed, perhaps, more than any\r\nother, to cherish and admire them, but led away by some errors that\r\nhad fatally drawn me from virtue, it is you have brought me back, who\r\nhave again made me feel all its charms. Would you impute, then, to\r\ncriminality this new affection? Will you blame your own work? Would you\r\nreproach yourself the interest you ought to take in it?—How can you\r\ndread so virtuous a sentiment, and what happiness can be greater than\r\nto experience it?\r\n\r\nMy affection frightens you. You think it too violent, too immoderate;\r\nqualify it, then, by a softer passion. Do not reject the obedience I\r\noffer you, which I now swear never to withdraw myself from, and in\r\nwhich I shall be ever virtuously employed. What sacrifice would be\r\npainful when your heart could dispense the reward? Where is the man so\r\nunthinking as not to know how to enjoy the privations he imposes on\r\nhimself; who would not prefer a word or a look which should be granted\r\nhim, to all the enjoyments he could steal or surprise? And yet you\r\nhave believed me to be such a man, and have dreaded me. Ah! why is not\r\nyour happiness dependent on me? How pleasingly should I be avenged\r\nin making you happy! But the influence of barren friendship will not\r\nproduce it; it is love alone can realize it.\r\n\r\nThis word alarms you; and, pray, why? A tender attachment, a stronger\r\nunion, congenial thoughts, the same happiness as the same sorrows; what\r\nis there in this that is foreign to you? Yet such is love; such is, at\r\nleast, the passion you have inspired, and which I feel. It is it that\r\ncalculates without interest, and rates the actions according to their\r\nmerit, and not their value, the inexhaustible treasure of sensitive\r\nsouls; every thing becomes precious formed for it or by it.\r\n\r\nThose striking truths, so easy to put in practice, what have they in\r\nthem frightful? What fears can a man of sensibility occasion you, to\r\nwhom love will never permit any other happiness than yours. It is now\r\nthe only vow I make. I would sacrifice every thing to fulfil it, except\r\nthe sentiment it inspires, which, if you even consent to admit, you\r\nshall regulate at will. But let us not suffer it to part us, when it\r\nought to reunite us, if the friendship you have offered me is not a\r\nfutile word. If, as you told me yesterday, it is the softest sentiment\r\nyour soul is capable of, let it stipulate between us; I shall not\r\nchallenge its decree: but in erecting it the judge of love, let it,\r\nat least, consent to hear its defence. To refuse to admit it would be\r\nunjust, which is not the characteristic of friendship.\r\n\r\nA second conversation will not be attended with more inconvenience than\r\nthe first; chance may furnish the opportunity; you might even appoint\r\nthe time. I will readily believe I am wrong: but would you not rather\r\nrecall me by reason, than to combat my opinion? And do you doubt my\r\ndocility? If I had not been interrupted, perhaps I had already been\r\nbrought over to your opinion; for your power over me knows no bounds.\r\n\r\nI will acknowledge, that this invincible power to which I have\r\nsurrendered, without daring to examine the irresistible charm that\r\ngives you the ascendancy over my thoughts and actions, often alarms me;\r\nand, perhaps, this conversation that I now solicit may be formidable\r\nto me. Perhaps, after being bound down by my promises, I shall see\r\nmyself reduced to consume with a flame which I well feel can never be\r\nextinguished, without even daring to implore your assistance. Ah! for\r\nheaven’s sake, Madam, do not abuse your power over me: but if it will\r\nmake you happier, if I shall appear more worthy of you, how much will\r\nmy pains be softened by those consoling ideas! Yes, I feel it. Again\r\nto converse with you, is furnishing you with stronger arms against me:\r\nit is submitting myself entirely to your will. It is easier to make a\r\ndefence against your letters; it is true, they are your sentiments: but\r\nyou are not present to give them their full force; yet the pleasure\r\nof hearing you induces me to defy the danger; at least, I shall have\r\nthe happiness of thinking I have done every thing for you even against\r\nmyself, and my sacrifices will become a homage; too happy, in being\r\nable to convince you in a thousand shapes, as I feel it, in a thousand\r\nways, that without self-exception, you are, and always will be, the\r\ndearest object of my heart.\r\n\r\n_Sept._ 23, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXIV.\r\n\r\nViscount de Valmont _to_ Cecilia Volanges.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou saw how we were disappointed yesterday. I could not find an\r\nopportunity to deliver you the letter I had the whole day; and I don’t\r\nknow whether I shall be more successful this day. I am afraid of\r\nhurting you by my over zeal; and should never forgive myself, if by my\r\nimprudence you should suffer; that would make my friend distracted,\r\nand you miserable. Yet I am not insensible to a lover’s impatience. I\r\nfeel how painful it is in your situation to experience delay in the\r\nonly consolation you are capable of receiving at this time. By dint of\r\nthinking on means to remove obstacles, I have found one that will be\r\npretty easy if you will but give your assistance.\r\n\r\nI think I remarked, the key of your chamber door, that opens into the\r\ngallery, hangs always upon your mamma’s chimney-piece. Every thing\r\nwould become easy, if we were once in possession of that key; but if it\r\nis not practicable, I can procure another exactly similar, which will\r\nanswer the purpose: it will be sufficient I should have the key for an\r\nhour or two. You can easily find an opportunity of taking it; and that\r\nit may not be missed, you have one belonging to me, which resembles it\r\npretty much, and the difference won’t be perceived unless it is tried,\r\nwhich I don’t think will be attempted. You must only take care to tie a\r\nblue ribband to it, like the one that is to your own.\r\n\r\nYou must endeavour to get this key to-morrow or the next day at\r\nbreakfast, because it will be then easier to give it me, and it may be\r\nput in its place again in the evening, which would be the time your\r\nmamma might take notice of it. I can return it to you at dinner, if we\r\nact properly.\r\n\r\nYou know, when we go from the saloon to the dining room, Madame de\r\nRosemonde always comes last; I will give her my hand; and all you have\r\nto do will be to quit your tapestry frame slowly, or let something\r\nfall, so that you make stay a little behind; then you will be able to\r\ntake the key, which I will hold behind me: but you must not neglect,\r\nas soon as you have taken it, to join my old aunt; and make her some\r\ncompliments. If you should accidentally let the key fall, don’t be\r\ndisconcerted; I will pretend it is myself, and I’ll answer for all.\r\n\r\nThe small confidence your mamma shows you, and the moroseness of her\r\nbehaviour, authorises this little deceit: but it is, moreover, the\r\nonly means to continue to receive Danceny’s letters, and to send him\r\nyours. Every other is too dangerous, and might irretrievably ruin you\r\nboth; and my prudent friendship would reproach me for ever, if I was to\r\nattempt any other.\r\n\r\nWhen I am once master of the key, there will be still some other\r\nprecautions to be taken against the noise the door and lock may\r\nmake, but them are easily removed. You will find, under the same\r\nclothes-press where I left your paper some oil and a feather. You\r\nsometimes go into your room alone, and you must take that opportunity\r\nto oil the lock and the hinges; the only thing you have to take care of\r\nis, that no drops may fall on the floor, which might discover you. You\r\nmust also take care to wait till night comes, because if you manage\r\nthis business dexterously, as I know you are capable of, nothing will\r\nappear in the morning.\r\n\r\nIf, however, any thing should be perceived, don’t hesitate to say it\r\nwas the servant that rubs the furniture; in that case, perhaps, it\r\nwould be necessary to tell the time and the conversation that passed:\r\nas, that he takes this precaution against rust for all the locks that\r\nare not constantly used; for you must be sensible it would not be very\r\nprobable that you should be a witness of it without asking the reason.\r\nThose are little details that aid probability, and probability makes\r\nlies of no consequence; as it takes away all curiosity to verify them.\r\n\r\nAfter you have read this letter once, I beg you to read it again, and\r\nimprint it well in your memory; for first one must understand well what\r\none has to do, and then, again, that you should be certain I have\r\nomitted nothing. As I am little used to employ artifice or cunning for\r\nmy own occasion, nothing but the strong friendship that I have for\r\nDanceny, and my compassion for you, could determine me to make use of\r\nthose innocent methods. I hate every thing that has the appearance of\r\ndeceit; that is my character: but your misfortunes so sensibly affect\r\nme, I would attempt everything to soften them.\r\n\r\nYou may believe, when once this communication is established between\r\nus, it will be much easier for me to procure you a meeting with\r\nDanceny, which he has so much at heart; but yet don’t mention all this\r\nto him, as it would only increase his impatience, and the time is not\r\nentirely come to satisfy it. You ought rather, I think, to calm than to\r\nirritate it; but that I leave to your own delicacy. Adieu, my pretty\r\npupil; for now you are my pupil. Love your tutor a little: but, above\r\nall, be very tractable, and you will find the benefit of it. I am\r\nemployed in endeavouring to make you happy; which, I promise you, will\r\nadd much to my own.\r\n\r\n_Sept._ 24, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXV.\r\n\r\nMarchioness de Merteuil _to_ Viscount de Valmont.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt length you will be satisfied, and do me justice; no longer blend me\r\nwith the rest of womankind: I have at last put an end to my adventure\r\nwith Prevan, and you shall judge which of the two has a right to boast\r\nThe recital will not be so amusing as the action; neither would it\r\nbe just, whilst you have done nothing but argue well or ill on this\r\nmatter, you should enjoy as much pleasure as me, who employed my time\r\nand care in this business.\r\n\r\nBut if you have any great affair in hand, any enterprise wherein this\r\ndangerous rival is your competitor, return; he has left you a clear\r\nstage, at least for some time; and perhaps will never recover the blow\r\nI have given him.\r\n\r\nWhat a happy man you are, to have me for a friend! I am your good\r\ngenius. You languish in absence from the beauty that possesses your\r\nheart; I speak the word, and instantly you are with her: you wish to be\r\nrevenged of a mischievous woman: I point out the place where you are\r\nto strike, and deliver her up to you: again, to set aside a formidable\r\ncompetitor, you still invoke me, and I grant your petition. Upon my\r\nword, if you don’t employ the remainder of your days in demonstrating\r\nyour gratitude, you are a base man: but to return to my adventure,\r\nand its origin. The rendezvous given out so loud at coming out of the\r\nopera[1] was heard, as I expected. Prevan was there, and when the\r\nMarechale told him obligingly, that she was happy to see him, twice\r\nrunning, on her public day, he took care to reply, that since Tuesday\r\nhe had got rid of a thousand appointments, to have it in his power to\r\nwait upon her this evening; _a word to the wise:_ however, as I was\r\ndetermined to be certain whether or not I was the true object of this\r\nflattering eagerness, I was determined to oblige my new admirer, to\r\nmake a choice between me and his reigning passion. I declared I would\r\nnot play, and he made a thousand pretences not to play: thus my first\r\ntriumph was over Lansquenet.\r\n\r\nI engrossed the bishop of —— for my conversation; chose him on\r\naccount of his relationship with the hero of the adventure, for whom I\r\nwished to smooth the way to make his approaches: was, moreover, glad\r\nto have a respectable witness, who could upon occasion answer for my\r\nconduct and conversation: this arrangement succeeded.\r\n\r\nAfter the customary vague chat, Prevan having soon made himself master\r\nof the conversation, engaged, upon different subjects, to endeavour\r\nto find out that which was most agreeable to me. The sentimental I\r\nrejected, as not worthy of credit. I stopped, by my serious air, his\r\ngaiety, which seemed too volatile for an opening: then he returned to\r\ndelicate friendship; and this was the subject that engaged us.\r\n\r\nThe bishop did not come down to supper; Prevan gave me his hand, and\r\nconsequently placed himself at table by me: I must be just; he kept up\r\nour private conversation with great address, as if he was only taken\r\nup with the general conversation, to which he seemed all attention. At\r\nthe dessert, a new piece was mentioned that was to be played the Monday\r\nfollowing at the French Comedy.—I expressed some regret at not being\r\nprovided with a box; he offered me his, which I refused, as usual: to\r\nwhich he replied, with great good humour, that I did not understand\r\nhim, for, certainly, he would not offer his lodge to a person he did\r\nnot know; he only meant to inform me that Madame la Marechale had the\r\ndisposal of it; she acquiesced to this piece of humour, and I accepted\r\nthe invitation. Being returned to the saloon, he begged, as you may\r\nsuppose, a seat in this box; and as the Marechale, who treats him very\r\nfamiliarly, promised it to him if he behaved himself well, he took\r\nthe opportunity of one of those double entendre conversations, for\r\nwhich you so profusely praise him, and throwing himself at her knees\r\nas a naughty child, under pretence of begging her advice and opinion,\r\nhe said a great many tender and flattering things, which it was easy\r\nfor me to apply to myself. Many of the company not having returned\r\nto play after supper, the conversation became more general and less\r\ninteresting, but our eyes spoke a great deal—I should say his, for\r\nmine had one language only, that of surprise; he must have imagined\r\nthat I was astonished, and amazingly taken up with the prodigious\r\nimpression he had made on me. I believe I left him pretty well\r\nsatisfied; and I was no less contented myself.\r\n\r\nThe Monday following I went to the French Comedy, as was agreed:\r\nnotwithstanding your literary curiosity, I cannot give you any\r\naccount of the representation, and can only tell you, that Prevan has\r\nan admirable talent for flattery, and that the piece was hooted. I\r\nwas somewhat troubled to see an evening so near an end, from which\r\nI promis’d myself so much pleasure, and, in order to prolong it, I\r\nrequested the Marechale to sup with me, which gave me an opportunity to\r\ninvite the lovely flatterer; he only begged time to disengage himself\r\nwith the Countesses de P——.[2] This name raised my indignation; I saw\r\nplainly he was beginning to make them his confidants; I called to mind\r\nyour prudent advice, and determined——to pursue the adventure, as I\r\nwas certain it would cure him of this dangerous indiscretion.\r\n\r\nBeing a stranger in my company, which was that night very small, he\r\npaid me the usual compliments, and when we went to supper, offered me\r\nhis hand—I was wicked enough, when I accepted it, to affect a light\r\ntremor, and, as I walked, to cast my eyes downwards, accompanied with\r\na difficulty of respiration—assumed the appearance of foreseeing my\r\ndefeat, and to dread my conqueror; he instantly remarked it, and the\r\ntraitor immediately changed his tone and behaviour: he was polite\r\nbefore, but now became all tenderness;—not but the conversation was\r\npretty much the same,—the circumstances required it; but his look was\r\nnot so lively, yet more flattering; the tone of his voice was softer;\r\nhis smile was not that of art but satisfaction; and his discourse\r\ngradually falling from his sallies, wit gave way to delicacy. Pray,\r\ngood Sir, what could you have done more?\r\n\r\nOn my side, I began to grow thoughtful to such a degree that it was\r\ntaken notice of; and when I was reproached with it, I had the address\r\nto defend myself so awkwardly, and to cast a quick, timid, and\r\ndisconcerted glance at Prevan, to make him imagine that all my fear was\r\nlest he should guess at the cause of my confusion.\r\n\r\nAfter supper, I took the opportunity, whilst the good Marechale was\r\ntelling one of those stories she had repeated a hundred times before,\r\nto place myself upon my sofa, in that kind of lassitude which a tender\r\nreverie brings on. I was not sorry Prevan should see me thus; and he\r\nreally did me the honour of a most particular, attention. You may very\r\nwell imagine my timid eyes did not dare lift themselves up to my\r\nconqueror, but being directed towards him in a more humble manner, they\r\nsoon informed me I had obtained my end: but still it was necessary to\r\npersuade him I also shared it, and as the Marechale said it was time to\r\nretire, I exclaimed in a soft and tender tone, “Oh, good God, I was so\r\nhappy there!” However, I rose; but before we parted, I asked her how\r\nshe intended to dispose of herself, to have an opportunity of saying,\r\nI intended to stay at home the day after to-morrow; on which we all\r\nparted.\r\n\r\nThen I sat down to reflect; I had no doubt but Prevan would improve the\r\nkind of rendezvous I had just given, that he would come time enough\r\nto find me alone, and the attack would be carried on with spirit; but\r\nI was certain that, reputation apart, he would not behave with that\r\nkind of familiarity which no well-bred person ever permits himself,\r\nonly with intriguing or unexperienced women; and I did not doubt of\r\nmy success, if he once let slip the word love, or if he even made any\r\npretension to draw it from me.\r\n\r\nHow convenient it is to be connected with you men of principle!\r\nSometimes the quarrels of lovers disconcert through timidity, or\r\nembarrass by its violent transports; it is a kind of fever which has\r\nits hot and cold fits, and sometimes varies its symptoms; but your\r\nregular progressions are easily seen through; the first salutation,\r\nthe deportment, the _ton_, the conversation, I knew all the evening\r\nbefore: I shall not, then, give you an account of the conversation,\r\nwhich you will readily conceive; only observe, that in my feigned\r\ndefence I helped him all in my power; embarrassments to give him time\r\nto speak, bad arguments to be discussed, fears and diffidence to bring\r\non protestations, the perpetual requisition from him, _I beg but one\r\nword,_ that silence on my part which only seemed to make him wish for\r\nit more; and besides all this a hand often squeezed, always drawn back,\r\nand never refused; thus a whole day would have passed, and we should\r\nhave passed another in this frivolity, perhaps would have been still\r\nengaged in the same, if we had not heard a coach coming into my court.\r\nThis happy mischance made his solicitations more pressing, and when I\r\nfound myself safe from all surprise, after having breathed a long sigh,\r\nI granted the precious word. Soon after company came in.\r\n\r\nPrevan requested to visit me the morning following, to which I\r\nconsented; being careful of myself, I ordered my waiting maid to stay\r\nduring the whole time of this visit in my bed chamber, from whence you\r\nknow, one may see every thing that passes in my dressing room. Our\r\nconversation was easy, and both having the same desires, we were soon\r\nagreed; it was necessary to get rid of this troublesome spectator; that\r\nwas where I waited for him.\r\n\r\nThen giving him an account of my domestic life, I easily persuaded him\r\nwe should never find a favourable opportunity, and he must look upon it\r\na kind of miracle that which he had yesterday, and was attended with\r\nsuch dangerous consequences as might expose me, as there was every\r\ninstant company coming into the saloon. I did not fail to add, those\r\nwere long established customs in my family, which, until then, had\r\nnever been varied, and at the same time insisted on the impossibility\r\nof altering them, as they would expose me to the reflections of my\r\nservants. He endeavoured to affect grief, to be out of humour, to tell\r\nme I had very little love: you may guess what an impression that made\r\non me. Being determined to strike the decisive blow, I called tears to\r\nmy assistance. It was the real scene in Zara, _You weep_. The ascendant\r\nhe thought he had gained over me, and the hope he conceived of ruining\r\nme in his own way, supplied him with all the love of Orosmane.\r\n\r\nThis theatrical scene being over, we returned to the settling our\r\nmeasures. No probability of success in the day, our thoughts were\r\ntaken up with the night; but my porter was an insurmountable obstacle,\r\nand I could not agree to any attempt to corrupt him: he then proposed\r\nthe small door of my garden; that I had foreseen. I pretended a dog\r\nthere, that was quiet and silent in the day-time, but a mere devil at\r\nnight. The facility with which I gave into all his schemes served to\r\nencourage him, and he soon proposed the most ridiculous expedient,\r\nwhich was the one I accepted.\r\n\r\nFirst, he assured me his domestic was as secret as himself; there he\r\ndid not deceive me, for one was as secret as the other: I was to give\r\na public supper, he would be of the party, would take his opportunity\r\nto slip out alone, his dextrous confidant would call his carriage,\r\nopen the door, and he, instead of getting in, would slip aside; thus,\r\nhaving disappeared to every body, yet being in my house, the question\r\nwas, how he should get into my apartment? I must own, that at first my\r\nembarrassment was to find out reasons against the project, to have the\r\nappearance of destroying it. He answered them by proofs; nothing was\r\nmore common than this method, he had often made use of it; it was even\r\nthe one he practised most, as being the least dangerous.\r\n\r\nBeing convinced by those unanswerable authorities, I candidly owned\r\nI had a back-stairs that led very near to my private closet; I could\r\nleave the key in the door, and he possibly might shut himself up in\r\nit, to wait there without any danger till my women were retired;\r\nthen, to give more probability to my consent, the moment afterwards I\r\nrefused, then again consented, only upon condition of the most perfect\r\nsubmission and good behaviour. To sum up all, I wanted to prove my\r\naffection, but not to satisfy his.\r\n\r\nHis departure in the morning, which I had forgot to mention, was\r\nsettled to be through the little gate in the garden; as he was to go\r\noff by day-light, the Cerberus would not speak a word; not a soul\r\npassed at that hour, and my people were all to be in a profound sleep.\r\nIf you are astonished at this heap of nonsense, you must forget our\r\nsituation: what business had we for better arguments? All that he\r\nrequired was, that the business should be known, and I was very certain\r\nit never should: the day after was fixed for the execution.\r\n\r\nObserve, here is an affair settled, and no one has ever yet seen\r\nPrevan in my company; he offers his box for a new piece, I accept of\r\na place in it; I invite this woman to supper during the performance,\r\nin Prevan’s presence; I can scarcely dispense proposing to him\r\nto make one; he accepts my offer; two days afterwards makes me a\r\nceremonial visit;—he comes, it is true, to visit me the day following,\r\nin the morning; but besides, as the morning visits are no longer\r\nexceptionable, it belongs to me to judge of this, and I account it\r\ntrifling.\r\n\r\nThe fatal day being come, the day on which I was to lose my virtue and\r\nreputation, I gave my instructions to my faithful Victoire, and she\r\nexecuted them to admiration.\r\n\r\nWhen evening came, I had a good deal of company; Prevan was announced;\r\nI received him with singular politeness, a proof of my slender\r\nacquaintance with him; I placed him with the Marechale’s party, as it\r\nwas in her company I had first been acquainted with him: the evening\r\nproduced nothing but a little note which the discreet lover found means\r\nto convey to me, and was burned, according to custom: he informed me,\r\nI might depend upon him; it was embellished with all the parasitical\r\nphrases of love, happiness, &c., which are never wanting upon such\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\nAt midnight, the parties being all finished, I proposed a short\r\nmacedoine.[3] In this project I first had in view to favour Prevan’s\r\nevasion, and at the same time to make it remarkable, which could not\r\nfail to happen, considering his reputation as a gamester; I was also\r\nglad, if there should hereafter be occasion, it might be remembered\r\nI was left alone. The game lasted longer than I had imagined; the\r\ndevil tempted me; I gave way to my desire, to console the impatient\r\nprisoner. I was thus proceeding to my ruin, when I reflected, if I\r\nonce surrendered, I should abandon the power of keeping him within the\r\nnecessary bounds of decency for my projects: I had strength enough\r\nto resist, and returned not in a very good humour to my place at this\r\nabominable game; at last it was finished, and every one departed: I\r\nrung for my women, undressed myself expeditiously, and sent them away.\r\n\r\nOnly think now, Viscount, you see me in my light robe, approaching with\r\na circumspect timid pace, and trembling hand, opening the door to my\r\nconqueror. The moment he perceived me, he flew like lightning. What\r\nshall I say? I was overcome, totally overcome, before I could speak a\r\nword to stop him or defend myself. Afterwards he wanted to take a more\r\ncommodious situation, and more adapted to our circumstances. He cursed\r\nhis dress as an obstacle to his complete bliss. He would engage with\r\nequal arms; but my extreme timidity opposed his desire, and my tender\r\ncaresses did not give him time. He was employed in other matters.\r\n\r\nHis rights were doubled; his pretensions revived: then “Harkee,” said\r\nI, “so far you have a tolerable pretty story for the two Countesses\r\nde P——, and a thousand others: but I have a great curiosity to know\r\nhow you will relate the end of this adventure.” Then ringing with all\r\nmy strength, I had my turn, my action was quicker than his speech. He\r\nscarcely stammered out a few words, when I heard Victoire calling all\r\nmy people that she had kept together in her apartment, as I had ordered\r\nher; then assuming the tone of a queen, and raising my voice, “Walk\r\nout, Sir,” said I, “and never dare appear again in my presence.” On\r\nwhich all my servants crowded in.\r\n\r\nPoor Prevan was distracted, and imagined murder was intended, when in\r\nreality it was nothing but a joke, seized his sword; he was mistaken,\r\nfor my valet-de-chambre, a resolute lusty fellow, grasped him round\r\nthe body, and soon brought him down. I own, I was very much terrified,\r\nordered them not to use him ill, but let him retire quietly, only to\r\ntake care he was put out of the house. My servants obeyed my orders:\r\nthere was a great bustle among them; they were enraged to the highest\r\ndegree, any one should dare to insult _their virtuous mistress;_ they\r\nall accompanied the unfortunate Chevalier, with all the noise and\r\nscandal I could wish. Victoire alone remained with me, and we repaired\r\nthe disorder the bed had suffered.\r\n\r\nMy people returned tumultuously; and I, _still in great emotion,_\r\ndesired to know by what good fortune they happened to be all up.\r\nVictoire said, she had given a supper to two of her friends; that they\r\nhad sat up in her apartment; and, in short, every thing as had been\r\nagreed on. I thanked then all, desired them to retire, directing one of\r\nthem to go immediately for my physician. I thought I was authorised to\r\nguard against the effects of this _dreadful shock;_ this was the surest\r\nmeans to give it currency, as well as celebrity.\r\n\r\nHe came, pitied me much, and prescribed repose. I moreover ordered\r\nVictoire to go about the neighbourhood in the morning early to spread\r\nthe news.\r\n\r\nEvery thing succeeded so well, that before noon, as soon as my doors\r\nwere open, my devout neighbour was at my bed’s head, to know the truth\r\nand the circumstances of this horrible adventure. I was obliged to\r\nlament with her a whole hour the corruption of the age. Soon after, I\r\nreceived the enclosed note from the Marechale, and before five, to my\r\ngreat astonishment, M——[4] waited on me, to make his excuses, as he\r\nsaid, that an officer of his corps should be guilty of such an offence.\r\nHe was informed of it at dinner at the Marechale’s, and immediately\r\nsent an order to Prevan, putting him under arrest. I requested he might\r\nbe forgiven, which he refused. I thought, as an accomplice, I should\r\nalso be punished, and kept within doors; I ordered my gate to be shut,\r\nand to let every one know I was indisposed.\r\n\r\nIt is to this solitude you are indebted for so long a letter. I\r\nshall write one to Madame de Volanges, which she will certainly read\r\npublicly, where you will see this transaction as it must be related.\r\n\r\nI forgot to tell you, that Belleroche is outrageous, and absolutely\r\ndetermined to fight Prevan. Poor fellow! But I shall have time to cool\r\nhis brain. In the mean time, I will go to repose my own, which is much\r\nfatigued by writing.

Is it possible that\r\nlittle Prevan should be guilty of such an abominable action to you!\r\nWhat is one not exposed to! We can be no longer safe in our own\r\nhouses! Upon my word, these events are a consolation to age; I shall\r\nnever forgive myself, as I have been partly the cause of your receiving\r\nsuch a monster into your house; I assure you, if what I hear is true,\r\nhe shall never more set foot in mine: it is what every one must do that\r\nhas any sentiments of honour, if they act properly.\r\n\r\nI have been informed you was very ill, and have been very uneasy about\r\nyour state of health; I beg you will let me hear from you; or if you\r\nare not able to write, pray let one of your women inform me how you\r\nare. A word will be sufficient to relieve my anxiety. I should have\r\nbeen with you this morning; but my doctor will not allow me to miss a\r\nday from my bath.\r\n\r\nI must go this morning to Versailles on my nephew’s business.\r\n\r\nFarewell, dear Madam! Depend upon my sincerest friendship.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Sept._ 25, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXVII.\r\n\r\n_The_ Marchioness de Merteuil _to_ Madame de Volanges.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear and worthy friend, I write this in bed. The most disagreeable\r\naccident, and the most impossible to be foreseen, has, by the violent\r\nshock and chagrin it has occasioned, given me a fit of illness; not\r\nthat I have any thing to reproach myself with: but it is always painful\r\nto a virtuous woman, who would preserve the modesty of her sex, to have\r\nthe eyes of the public fixed on her, and I would give the world to\r\nhave avoided this unhappy adventure. I do not yet know but I shall go\r\nto the country until it is blown over. The matter is thus:\r\n\r\nI met at the Marechale de ——’s a Mr. Prevan, who you certainly know\r\nby name, and was no otherwise known to me; meeting him accidentally at\r\nher house, I thought myself safe in looking upon him as good company;\r\nhis person is tolerable, and he is not deficient in wit; chance, and\r\nbeing tired at play, left me the only woman in company with him and\r\nthe bishop of ——. Whilst all the others were engaged at lansquenet,\r\nwe chatted together until supper. At table a new piece was mentioned,\r\nwhich gave him an opportunity of offering his box to the Marechale, who\r\naccepted of it; it was agreed I should attend her: this appointment\r\nwas for Monday last at the French Comedy. As the Marechale was to\r\nsup with me after the performance, I proposed to this gentleman to\r\naccompany her; he accordingly came. Two days after he paid me a visit,\r\nwhich passed in the usual conversation; not a single word of any thing\r\nremarkable; the day following he again visited me in the morning,\r\nwhich, as it was something extraordinary, I thought it was better,\r\ninstead of making him sensible, by my manner of receiving him, to\r\npolitely inform him we were not yet on so intimate a footing as he\r\nseemed to think; for this reason I sent him that same day a ceremonious\r\ninvitation to a supper which I gave the day before yesterday. I did not\r\nspeak four words to him during the whole evening, and he retired as\r\nsoon as his party was finished. So far you will agree, nothing had the\r\nair of an intrigue. After play was over, we made a macedoine, which\r\nlasted till two o’clock, and then I went to bed.\r\n\r\nMy women were gone a full half-hour, when I heard a noise in my\r\napartment. I drew my curtain in a great fright, and saw a man coming in\r\nfrom my closet-door. I shrieked out, and recognised, by my watch light,\r\nthis Mr. Prevan, who, with a most inconceivable effrontery, bid me not\r\nbe alarmed, that he would clear up the mystery of his conduct, and\r\nrequested me not to make any noise. Thus saying, he lighted a bougie.\r\nI was frightened to such a degree, that I could not speak a word; his\r\neasy and tranquil air petrified me still more: but he had not spoke two\r\nwords, before I perceived what this pretended mystery was, and my only\r\nanswer, as you may well believe, was to ring my bell.\r\n\r\nBy good fortune, my servants, who had been making merry with one of my\r\nwomen, were not gone to bed. My waiting woman, when near my room, heard\r\nme speaking very loud, was frightened, and called all my people. Judge\r\nyou what a scandal! They were enraged; I thought my valet-de-chambre\r\nwould have killed Prevan. I must own, at that time I was very glad to\r\nhave such a powerful assistance: but on reflection, I would rather my\r\nwaiting woman alone had come; she would have been sufficient, and I\r\nshould, perhaps, have avoided all this noise which afflicts me.\r\n\r\nThe tumult awoke all the neighbours; the people talked, and since\r\nyesterday the news has spread all over Paris. Monsieur de Prevan is\r\na prisoner, by order of the commandant of his corps, who had the\r\npoliteness to call on me to make an apology. This imprisonment will\r\naugment the noise, but I have not been able to prevent it. The court\r\nand city have been at my gate, which is shut to every body. The few\r\npersons I have admitted have assured me, every one does me justice,\r\nand the public resentment is very high against Monsieur de Prevan; he\r\ncertainly deserves it: but that does not wipe away this disagreeable\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\nMoreover, this man has certainly some friends, and who knows what such\r\nfriends may invent to my prejudice? Good God! how unhappy a young woman\r\nis! When she has even sheltered herself against slander, it is not\r\nsufficient, she must also silence calumny.\r\n\r\nI beg you will let me know what you would have done, and what you would\r\ndo in my situation, with your opinion. It has always been from you\r\nI received the gentlest and most prudent consolations: it is still\r\nfrom you I wish to receive them. Adieu, my dear, good friend! You know\r\nthe sentiments that attach me to you for ever. I embrace your amiable\r\ndaughter, and am, &c.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Dec._ 26, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF THE SECOND VOLUME.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDANGEROUS\r\nCONNECTIONS:\r\n\r\nOR,\r\nLETTERS\r\nCOLLECTED IN A SOCIETY,\r\nAND\r\nPUBLISHED FOR THE INSTRUCTION OF\r\nOTHER SOCIETIES.\r\n\r\nBY M.

First, I think it too dangerous; the key you desire I should\r\nput in the place of the other resembles it pretty much, it is true: but\r\nstill there is some difference, and mama is so exceedingly watchful,\r\nthat nothing escapes her; besides, though it has not been used since\r\nwe came here, an accident might happen, and if it was missed, I\r\nshould be ruined for ever. Moreover, it would be very wrong to have\r\na double key; that would be too much: it is true, you would take the\r\nmanagement of it yourself; but yet if it should come to be known, all\r\nthe reproach would fall on me, as it would be done for me; not that\r\nthere is any difficulty in the matter, and I twice had a mind to take\r\nit, but something came over me, and I was seized with such a tremor, my\r\nresolution failed me. I believe, then, we had better remain as we are.\r\n\r\nIf you will be so good to continue your friendship as you have done\r\nhitherto, you will always find an opportunity to deliver me a letter.\r\nEven the last I should have had very readily, had it not been for the\r\naccident of your turning about so suddenly. I am very sensible, you\r\ncannot be always taken up with those matters as I am: but I would\r\nrather have a little patience than run such risks. I am certain Mr.\r\nDanceny would be of the same opinion: for whenever he wanted any thing\r\nI was not inclined to, he instantly gave it up.\r\n\r\nYou will find, Sir, with this letter, your own, Mr. Danceny’s, and your\r\nkey. I am, nevertheless, extremely obliged to you for your kindness,\r\nwhich I entreat you to continue to me. I am, indeed, very miserable,\r\nand should be much more so, were it not for you: but she is my mother,\r\nand I must have patience; and provided Mr. Danceny will always love\r\nme, and you do not desert me, I may yet, perhaps, be happy.\r\n\r\nI have the honour to be, with the utmost gratitude, Sir, your most\r\nhumble and obedient servant.\r\n\r\n_Sept._ 26, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER LXXXIX.\r\n\r\n_The_ Viscount de Valmont _to the_ Chevalier Danceny.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf your affairs do not go on quite so rapidly as you wish, my dear\r\nfriend, it is not altogether my fault. I have many obstacles to\r\nencounter here. Madame de Volanges’ vigilance and severity are not\r\nthe only ones; your young friend also throws some in my way. Whether\r\nit proceeds from coldness, or timidity, she will not always do what\r\nI advise her; and yet I think I should know better than she what is\r\nproper to be done.\r\n\r\nI had proposed an easy, commodious, and safe way of delivering your\r\nletters to her, and even to smooth the way of the interviews you wish\r\nfor so much; but I have not been able to determine her to make use of\r\nit. This gives me the more concern, as I can’t think of any other means\r\nof bringing you together; and I am even incessantly terrified at the\r\ndanger we all three are exposed to on account of your correspondence;\r\nyou may then very well imagine, I do not choose to risk myself, nor\r\nexpose you both to it.\r\n\r\nStill it would give me the greatest uneasiness, that your little\r\nfriend’s want of confidence in me should deprive me of the pleasure\r\nof being useful to you; I think you would do well to write to her on\r\nthe subject. Act as you think proper; you are to determine; for it is\r\nnot enough that we serve our friends: we must serve them in the manner\r\nthe most pleasing to themselves. It might be also one other means of\r\nascertaining the degree of her affection for you; for the woman who\r\nretains a will of her own, does not love to that degree she ought. Not\r\nthat I have any suspicion of her constancy: but she is very young; she\r\nis in great awe of her mother, who you already know to be your enemy;\r\ntherefore it might be dangerous to suffer her to wain her mind from\r\nyou: however, I would not have you make yourself in the least uneasy,\r\nas it is the solicitude of friendship only, and not any diffidence\r\nwhatever, that makes me so explicit.\r\n\r\nI must break off, as I have some important matters of my own to attend.\r\nI am not so far advanced as you are: but my passion is as ardent; that\r\nis my consolation. And was I to be unsuccessful in my own, it would be\r\na pleasure to think, my time has been well employed if I can be useful\r\nin yours. Adieu, my dear friend!\r\n\r\n_Castle of_ ——, _Sept._ 26, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XC.\r\n\r\n_The_ Presidente de Tourvel _to the_ Viscount de Valmont.\r\n\r\n\r\nI much wish, Sir, this letter may not give you uneasiness; or, if it\r\nshould, I hope it will be alleviated by that which I confess I now\r\nexperience in writing to you. You should, I think, by this time be\r\nsufficiently acquainted with my sentiments, to be assured I would not\r\nwillingly afflict you; and flatter myself, you are incapable of making\r\nme for ever miserable. I beseech you, then, by the tender friendship I\r\nhave professed, and those softer sentiments, and more sincere than any\r\nyou have for me, let us no longer see one another. Leave me; and until\r\nthen, let us avoid particularly those dangerous conversations, when by\r\nan unaccountable attraction I am lost in attending to what I ought not\r\nto listen to, and forget what I intend to say.\r\n\r\nWhen you joined company with me in the park yesterday, I fully intended\r\ntelling you what I am now about to write. What was the consequence? Why\r\nto be totally engaged on a subject to which I ought never to listen:\r\nyour love. For heaven’s sake! depart from me. Fear not that absence\r\nshould alter my sentiments for you; for how can I possibly overcome\r\nthem, when I am no longer able to contend with them. You see I confess\r\nmy weakness, and I dread less to own it than I do to yield to it: but\r\nthe command I have lost over my mind, I will still preserve over my\r\nactions; this I am determined on, were it at the expence of life.\r\n\r\nAlas! the time is not very distant, that I imagined myself proof\r\nagainst such temptations. I felicitated myself on it, I fear, too much;\r\nI was, perhaps, too vain of it; and Heaven has punished, and cruelly\r\npunished, that pride: but all-merciful, even in the hour in which it\r\nstrikes us, it warns me again before an utter fall; and I should be\r\ndoubly guilty, if, being sensible of my weakness, I should abandon my\r\nprudence.\r\n\r\nYou have often told me, you would not desire a happiness purchased at\r\nthe expence of my tears. Let us no longer talk of happiness; let me, at\r\nleast, regain some degree of tranquillity.\r\n\r\nIn acceding to my request, what fresh claims will you not acquire\r\nover my heart, and those founded upon virtue! How I shall enjoy my\r\ngratitude! I shall owe to you the happiness of entertaining, without\r\nany remorse, a sentiment of the most delicious kind. Now, on the\r\ncontrary, startled at my sentiments and my thoughts, I am equally\r\nafraid of occupying my mind either with you or myself. The very idea\r\nof you terrifies me. When I cannot fly from it, I combat it. I do not\r\nbanish it, but repulse it.\r\n\r\nIs it not better for us to terminate this state of trouble and anxiety?\r\nYou, whose tender heart has even in the midst of errors remained the\r\nfriend of virtue, you will attend to my distressed situation; you will\r\nnot reject my prayer. A milder but as tender an attachment will succeed\r\nthese violent agitations. Then regaining my existence through your\r\nbeneficence, I will cherish that existence, and will say in the joy of\r\nmy heart, the calm I now feel I owe to my friend.\r\n\r\nBy submitting to some slight privations, which I do not impose upon\r\nyou, but entreat you to yield to, will you think a termination of my\r\nsufferings too dearly purchased? Ah! if to render you happy, there was\r\nonly my own consent that I should be unhappy, you may rely on it, I\r\nshould not hesitate a moment: but to become criminal! no, my friend, I\r\nshall prefer a thousand deaths.\r\n\r\nEven now, assailed by shame, and on the eve of remorse, I dread all\r\nothers and myself equally. I blush when in any circle, and feel a\r\nhorror when in solitude. I no longer lead any but a life of grief. I\r\ncan only re-establish my tranquillity by your consent; my most laudable\r\nresolutions are insufficient to afford me security. I have formed the\r\nresolution I have just mentioned no longer than yesterday, and yet have\r\npassed the last night in tears.\r\n\r\nBehold your friend, her whom you love, confounded, and supplicating\r\nyou for the preservation of her repose and her innocence. Oh, heaven!\r\nwould she ever but through your means have been reduced to make such\r\nhumiliating entreaties! I, however, do not reproach you with any thing.\r\nI feel too sensibly, from the experience of myself, how difficult it is\r\nto resist so over-ruling a sentiment. A lamentation such as mine ought\r\nnot to be deemed a murmur. Do, from generosity what I do from duty; and\r\nto all the sentiments you have inspired me with, I shall add that of\r\neternal gratitude. Adieu, adieu, Sir!\r\n\r\n_From_ ——, _Sept._ 27, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCI.\r\n\r\nViscount de Valmont _to the_ Presidente de Tourvel.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlunged into consternation as I am by your letter, how shall I answer\r\nit, Madam? Doubtless, if the alternative is your unhappiness or mine,\r\nit is my duty to sacrifice myself, and I do not hesitate to do it:\r\nbut concerns so interesting, merit, I think, full discussion and\r\nelucidation; and how shall we arrive at that, if we are no longer to\r\nsee or speak to one another.\r\n\r\nWhat! whilst the most tender sentiments unite us, shall a vain terror\r\nbe able to separate us, perhaps, for ever! Shall tender friendship\r\nand ardent love in vain endeavour to assert their rights, and their\r\nvoices remain unattended to! And why? what is this very urgent danger\r\nwhich threatens you? Ah! believe me, such fears, and fears taken up\r\nso lightly, are in themselves sufficiently powerful motives for your\r\nconsidering yourself in a state of security.\r\n\r\nPermit me to tell you, I can here trace again the unfavourable\r\nimpressions which have been made upon you with regard to me. No woman\r\ntrembles at the man she esteems. No woman banishes him in a marked\r\nmanner, whom she has thought worthy of some degree of friendship. It is\r\nthe dangerous man who is feared and fled.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, was there ever a person more respectful and submissive than I?\r\nYou must perceive it. Guarded in my language, I no longer permit myself\r\nthose appellations so sweet, so dear to my heart, and which that heart\r\nunceasingly applies to you secretly. It is no longer the faithful and\r\nunfortunate lover receiving the advice and consolation of a tender and\r\nfeeling female friend. I am in the situation of the accused before his\r\njudge, of the slave before his lord. These new titles certainly impose\r\non me duties: I bind myself to fulfil them all. Hear me, and if you\r\ncondemn me, I subscribe to my sentence and depart. I will go farther.\r\nDo you prefer that despotism which decides without a hearing? Do you\r\nfeel boldness enough to commit an act of injustice? Give your orders;\r\nyou shall be obeyed.\r\n\r\nBut let me have this sentence or order from your mouth. But why? You\r\nwill tell me in your turn. Ah! if you put such a question, you are a\r\nstranger to love and to my heart. Is it nothing to see you? I repeat\r\nit again. Even when you shall strike despair to my soul, perhaps a\r\nconsoling glance will prevent its sinking. In a word; if I must\r\nrenounce love and friendship, the only props of my existence, at\r\nleast you will behold your works, and I shall engage your compassion.\r\nThough I should not even deserve this small favour, I think I submit\r\nto pay dearly enough for it, to give me hopes of obtaining it. What,\r\nyou are about to banish me from you! You can consent, then, that we\r\nshould become utter strangers to one another! What do I say? It is the\r\nwish of your heart; and whilst you assure me that my absence shall\r\nnot prejudice me in your sentiments, you only hasten my departure, in\r\norder more securely to effect their destruction, which you begin even\r\nnow, by talking of substituting gratitude in their place. Thus you\r\noffer me only that sentiment which a stranger would inspire you with\r\nfor a slight service; that kind of sentiment which you would feel for\r\nan enemy desisting from premeditated injury; and you expect my heart\r\nto be content with this. Interrogate your own. If a lover, a friend,\r\nshould ever come to talk to you of gratitude, would you not say to him\r\nwith indignation, Withdraw, you are a worthless man?\r\n\r\nI shall here stop, and repeat my requests of your indulgence. Pardon\r\nthe expressions of grief of which you are the cause; they shall not\r\ninterfere with my perfect submission: but I conjure you in turn, in\r\nthe name of those tender sentiments which you yourself resort to with\r\nme, refuse not to hear; and from mere compassion for the aggravated\r\ndistress you have plunged me in, defer not the moment in which you will\r\ncondescend to hear me. Adieu, Madam!\r\n\r\n_From_ ——, _Sept._ 7, 17—, _at night._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCII.\r\n\r\nChevalier Danceny _to the_ Viscount de Valmont.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour letter, my dear friend, has overwhelmed me with sorrow. Heavens!\r\nIs it possible Cecilia no longer loves her Danceny! Yes, I plainly see\r\nit through the veil your friendship has thrown over it. You wished to\r\nprepare me for this mortal stab; I thank you for your care: but a lover\r\nit not thus to be deceived; he anticipates his concerns; he is not to\r\nlearn his fate, he presages it. I have no longer any doubt of mine. I\r\nentreat you to inform me, without evasion, from whence your suspicions\r\narise, and what confirms them; the most minute trifles are important.\r\nRecollect particularly her expressions. A word may alter a phrase, or\r\nbear a double meaning. You may have mistaken her.\r\n\r\nAlas, I endeavour still to flatter myself. What did she say? Has she\r\nany thing to reproach me with? Does she not attempt to excuse herself?\r\nI might have foreseen this alteration by all the difficulties she has\r\nlately started. Love admits no obstacles.\r\n\r\nWhat am I to do? What would you advise me to? Is it then impossible to\r\nsee her? Absence is such a dreadful, such a fatal—and she refuses the\r\nmeans you proposed to see me! You don’t, however, tell me what it was;\r\nif it really was dangerous, she is convinced I would not have her run a\r\ngreat risk: however, I am satisfied of your prudence, and pay no regard\r\nto any other consideration.\r\n\r\nWhat will now become of me? How shall I write to her? If I hint my\r\nsuspicions, she will probably be grieved; and should they be ill\r\ngrounded, how shall I ever forgive myself for having given her cause\r\nfor affliction? If I conceal them, it is deceiving her, and I cannot\r\ndissemble it.\r\n\r\nOh! could she but know what I suffer, my distress would move her, for\r\nshe is tender, has a most excellent heart, and I have a thousand proofs\r\nof her affection. Too much timidity, some distress, she is young, and\r\nher mother treats her so severely. I will write to her; yet I will\r\ncontain myself, and will only beg of her to leave the management of\r\nevery thing to you. If she should even still refuse, she cannot at\r\nleast be angry with me, and perhaps she may consent.\r\n\r\nI beg ten thousand pardons, my dear friend, both for her and myself.\r\nGive me leave to assure you, she is very sensible of the trouble you\r\nhave had, and is exceedingly grateful. It is not distrust, it is merely\r\ntimidity. Have a little compassion for her weakness, the highest\r\nattribute of friendship. Yours to me is inestimable, and I am really at\r\na loss how to express my gratitude. Adieu! I am just going to write to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nAll my fears return on me. I could not have believed yesterday, when it\r\nwould have been my greatest happiness, that I should now experience so\r\nmuch distress in writing to her.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear friend! continue your friendship, and compassionate me.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Sept._ 27, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCIII.\r\n\r\nChevalier Danceny _to_ Cecilia Volanges.\r\n\r\n\r\nI cannot conceal my affliction at hearing from Valmont how much you\r\nstill distrust him. You know he is my friend, and the only person who\r\ncan give us an opportunity of seeing each other: I fondly imagined this\r\nwould have been a sufficient recommendation, but am very sorry to find\r\nI am mistaken. May I, however, hope to know your reasons? There are,\r\nperhaps, some obstacles that prevent you; I cannot, however, without\r\nyour aid, guess at this mysterious conduct. I dare not entertain any\r\nsuspicion of your affection, neither would you deceive mine. Ah,\r\nCecilia!\r\n\r\nIt is, then, past a doubt, that you have refused _an easy, commodious,\r\nand safe way_[1] of seeing me. And is it thus I am beloved? Has so\r\nshort an absence altered your sentiments?—Why, then, deceive me? Why\r\ntell me you still love me, and even still more? Has your mama, by\r\ndestroying your affection for me, also destroyed your candour?—If,\r\nhowever, she has not left you destitute of compassion, you will feel\r\nfor the pangs you occasion me, which death cannot even equal.\r\n\r\nTell me, then, have I for ever lost your heart? Am I totally forgotten?\r\nI know not when you will hear my complaints, nor when they will be\r\nanswered. Valmont’s friendship had secured our correspondence, but you\r\nrejected it; you thought it troublesome; it was too frequent. Never\r\nmore will I confide in love or in promises. Who is to be believed, when\r\nCecilia deceives me?\r\n\r\nAm I no longer, then, your beloved Danceny? No, that is not possible;\r\nyou deceive your own heart. A transitory apprehension, a momentary\r\ngloom, causes my present distress, which love will soon dispel: is it\r\nnot so, my adorable Cecilia? Yes, it is, and I am much to blame for\r\naccusing you. How happy shall I be to discover my error, and repair it\r\nby soothing apologies and never-ending love.\r\n\r\nCecilia, lovely Cecilia, take pity on me; consent to see me; form the\r\nplan yourself: this is the consequence of absence; fears, doubts, and\r\nperhaps coolness. One single glance, a word only, and we shall be\r\nhappy. But why mention happiness? Mine is, perhaps, at an end, and that\r\nfor ever. Tortured with apprehensions, suspended between doubts and\r\nfears, I cannot form a resolution. My existence depends on love and\r\nsufferings: You alone, my Cecilia, are the arbitress of my fate; you\r\nalone can decide on my happiness or misery.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Sept._ 27, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Danceny does not know the way; he only repeats Valmont’s expression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCIV.\r\n\r\nCecilia Volanges _to the_ Chevalier Danceny.\r\n\r\n\r\nI cannot conceive a word of your letter,——it gives me much\r\nuneasiness. What, then, has M. de Valmont wrote to you? Can you think\r\nI no longer love you? Perhaps it would be much better for me if it\r\nwas otherwise, for I should not be so tormented as I am; it is really\r\nhard, that, loving as I do, you should always think me wrong; and\r\ninstead of receiving consolation in my afflictions, the cause of\r\nall my troubles should proceed from you. You imagine I deceive and\r\nmisrepresent matters to you. Upon my word you have a good opinion of\r\nme: But even suppose it the case, what would it avail me? Certainly,\r\nif I ceas’d loving you, all my friends would be glad of it; but it is\r\nmy misfortune I cannot, and must love a man who is not in the least\r\nobliged to me.\r\n\r\nWhat have I done, then, to put you so much out of temper? I was afraid\r\nto take a key, lest my mama should discover it, and bring more trouble\r\non you and me; moreover, I did not think it right. How did I know\r\nwhether I was acting right or wrong, as you knew nothing of the matter,\r\nand it was Mr. Valmont only that mentioned it? Now that I know you\r\nwould wish me to do it, I will take it to-morrow; then, I suppose, you\r\nwill be satisfied—Mr. de Valmont may be your friend, for ought I know,\r\nbut I think I love you at well as he does, at least; and yet he is\r\nalways right, and I am wrong.—I assure you, I am very angry; however,\r\nthat gives you no great uneasiness, as you know I am soon pacified:\r\nwhen I have the key, I can see you whenever I please: if you behave in\r\nthis manner, though, I will not wish for it; I can better bear my own\r\ntroubles than those you bring on me.\r\n\r\nWe might be happy still, only for the little disagreeable occurrences\r\nthrown in our way; if I was my own mistress, you would have no reason\r\nto complain: But, if you will not believe me, we shall always be very\r\nmiserable; yet it shall not be my fault. I hope we shall soon see each\r\nother, and then shall have no reason to be so tormented as we are now.\r\n\r\nCould I have foreseen all this, the key should have been in my\r\npossession; but, indeed, I thought I was doing right. Do not be angry\r\nwith me, I beg of you. Don’t afflict yourself any more, and love me as\r\nmuch as I love you; then I shall be happy. Adieu, my dear friend.\r\n\r\n_From the castle of_ ——, _Sept._ 28, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCV.\r\n\r\nCecilia Volanges _to the_ Viscount de Valmont.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI beg you will return me the key you gave me to put in the place of the\r\nother; since it must be so, I must agree to it.\r\n\r\nI don’t know why you should write to Mr. Danceny, I did not love him:\r\nI don’t think I ever gave you any reason to say so; it has given us\r\nboth a great deal of uneasiness:—I know you have a friendship for him,\r\ntherefore should not fret him nor me neither. I should be much obliged\r\nto you if, when you write to him next, you would assure him of the\r\ncontrary; for he reposes his confidence in you: nothing gives me so\r\nmuch trouble as not to be believed when I say a thing.\r\n\r\nAs to the key, you may make yourself perfectly easy; I remember all you\r\nwrote me very well; but if you have your letter still by you, and will\r\ngive it to me at the same time, I assure you I shall take particular\r\nnotice of it. If you contrive to give it me to-morrow as we go to\r\ndinner, I would give you the other key the day after at breakfast, and\r\nyou could return it to me in the same way you did the first. Pray do\r\nnot defer it any longer, as we ought not to give Mama an opportunity to\r\ndiscover it.\r\n\r\nWhen you have once got possession of the key, you will be so good\r\nto make use of it to take my letters; and by this means Mr. Danceny\r\nwill oftener hear from me, which will be much more convenient than at\r\npresent. I was a good deal frightened at first, which I hope you will\r\nbe so good to excuse; and that you will, nevertheless, continue your\r\nfriendship as heretofore: you may depend on my gratitude.\r\n\r\nI have the honour to be, SIR, Your most obedient Humble Servant.\r\n\r\n_Sept._ 28, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCVI.\r\n\r\nViscount de Valmont _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nI dare say, you have been in daily expectation of my compliments and\r\neulogiums on your adventure; I even make no doubt but my long silence\r\nmay have put you a little out of temper: But to sum up all, I will\r\nfreely own I have ever thought, that when one had nothing but praise\r\nto offer a woman, he might safely trust to herself, and employ his\r\ntime on other matters. Yet I must thank you for my share in it, and\r\ncongratulate you on your own. I will even, for this once, to make you\r\nperfectly happy, agree you have much surpassed my expectations. And now\r\nlet us see, whether, on my side, I have not partly fulfilled yours.\r\n\r\nMadame de Tourvel is not the subject we are now on; her slow\r\nproceedings do not meet your approbation; you like to hear of business\r\ndone; long-spun scenes disgust you; but I never before experienced the\r\npleasure I do now in those pretended delays.\r\n\r\nYes, I enjoy it; to see this prudent woman, entangled imperceptibly\r\nin a path from whence she cannot return; whose rapid and dangerous\r\ndeclivity hurries her on against her will, and forces her to follow\r\nme—then, frightened at the danger, would, but cannot stop;—her\r\nanxiety and wariness make her steps slow, but still they must succeed\r\neach other. Sometimes, not daring to view the danger, she shuts her\r\neyes, and abandons herself to my care. New dreads often reanimate her\r\nefforts; and, in her grievous fright, she again endeavours to return,\r\nwastes her strength to climb painfully a short space; and soon, by a\r\nmagic power, finds herself nearer the danger she vainly endeavoured to\r\nfly. Then, having no other guide or support but me, without thinking\r\nany longer of reproaching me with her inevitable fall, she implores\r\nme to protract it. Fervent prayers, humble supplications, all that\r\nterrified mortals offer up to the Divinity, I receive from her; and\r\nyou would have me be deaf to her vows, to destroy the worship she\r\nrenders me, and employ the power she invokes to support her, in hurling\r\nher into destruction. Let me at least have time to contemplate this\r\naffecting struggle between love and virtue.\r\n\r\nIs not this, then, the exhibition you fly to at the theatre with so\r\nmuch avidity, and applaud with so much ardour? And do you imagine it\r\ncan be less endearing in realizing it?—The sentiments of a pure and\r\ntender heart, which dreads the happiness it wishes, and ceases not\r\nto defend itself when it even ceases to resist, you enthusiastically\r\nadmire: And pray, is the ruling principle of this great work to be\r\nrejected?\r\n\r\nYet, those are the delicious enjoyments this celestial woman daily\r\noffers me, and you reproach me for relishing them. Alas! the time will\r\ncome too soon when, degraded by her fall, I shall view her with as much\r\nindifference as another.\r\n\r\nBut I wander; for, speaking of her, I forget that I did not intend even\r\nto mention her. An unknown power impels me, and incessantly recalls her\r\nto me when I am even injuring her: let me banish this dangerous idea,\r\nbe myself again, and entertain you with a more agreeable adventure.\r\nYour late pupil, now become mine, shall be the subject; and now, I\r\nhope, you’ll again know your friend.\r\n\r\nHaving, for a few days past, been more gently treated by my charming\r\ndevotee, and consequently more disengaged, I observed the little\r\nVolanges was really handsome; and that if it was ridiculous in\r\nDanceny to be in love with her, it would be no less so in me not to\r\nembrace a dissipation that my solitude called for. I even thought it\r\nan act of justice, to repay myself for the trouble I had had with\r\nher: I recollected, also, that you offered her to me before Danceny\r\nhad any pretensions to her; and thought myself well grounded in\r\nasserting certain rights, which he claimed only from my refusal and\r\nabdication. The engaging mien of the little creature, her pretty\r\nmouth, her childish air, even her awkwardness, strengthened those\r\nsage reflections. I determined to act conformably, and success has\r\ncrown’d the enterprise. I think I see you all impatience to know how I\r\nsupplanted the cherished lover, the seducing arts fit to be employed\r\nfor such a tender age, and so unexperienced: spare yourself the\r\ntrouble, for I employed none.—Whilst you, managing with dexterity the\r\narms of your sex, triumph by artifice, I, in a manly way, subdue by\r\nauthority,—sure of my prey, if I can close with it. I had no occasion\r\nfor dissimulation, but to get it within my reach, and that I made use\r\nof scarcely deserves the name.\r\n\r\nI took the advantage of the first letter Danceny wrote to his fair\r\none, and, after having made the signal agreed on, instead of employing\r\nmy address to deliver it, I contriv’d obstacles to prevent it; and,\r\nfeigning a share in the impatience this excited, pointed out the remedy\r\nafter causing the evil.\r\n\r\nThe young thing is lodged in an apartment that opens into the gallery,\r\nand the mother, very properly, keeps the key. Nothing, then, was\r\nwanting but to get possession of the key, and nothing more easy in the\r\nexecution: I asked for it for two hours, only to have another made by\r\nit: then correspondence, interviews, nocturnal rendezvous, all were\r\nconvenient and safe: but, would you believe it, the timid child was\r\nfrightened, and refused. Any other would have been driven to despair:\r\nto me it was a more poignant pleasure. I wrote to Danceny, complaining\r\nof this denial; and was so successful, that the thoughtless youth\r\nurged, nay even exacted of his timid mistress, that she should agree to\r\nmy request, and give herself up to my discretion.\r\n\r\nI must own myself well pleased to change my character, and that the\r\nyoung man should do for me what he expected I was to do for him.\r\nThis idea enhanc’d the value of the adventure; and, as soon as I got\r\npossession of the delicious key, I lost no time:—it was last night.\r\n\r\nWhen I was assured all were at rest in the Castle, taking my dark\r\nlantern, and in a proper toilette for the hour and circumstance, I paid\r\nmy first visit to your pupil. Every thing had been prepared (and that\r\nby herself) to prevent noise: she was in her first sleep, so that I\r\nwas by her bed side without awaking her. I was at first tempted to go\r\non farther, and make every thing pass for a dream; but dreading the\r\neffects of a surprise, and the consequences naturally attendant, I\r\nchose to awake the pretty sleeper cautiously, which I effected without\r\nthe alarm I dreaded.\r\n\r\nAfter having calmed her first fears, as I did not come there to chat,\r\nI ventured to take some liberties: they did not, certainly, inform\r\nher in the convent, to how many different dangers timid innocence\r\nis exposed, and all that she had to take care of to guard against a\r\nsurprise; for, using all her strength to prevent a kiss, which was only\r\na false attack, she left all the rest defenceless: how was it possible\r\nto resist the temptation?—I then changed my attack, and immediately\r\ntook possession of the post. At that instant we had both like to be\r\nundone; the little girl, scared, was in earnest going to cry out;\r\nhappily, her voice was stifled with her tears: she flung herself, also,\r\non the string of the bell, but I held her arm opportunely.\r\n\r\n“What are you about? (then said I) Will you ruin yourself for ever?\r\nDo you think you will be able to persuade any one that I am here\r\nwithout your consent? Who but yourself could supply me the means of\r\ngetting in?—And this key that I had from you, which I could not have\r\nfrom any one else, will you take it upon you to tell the use it was\r\ndesigned for?”—This short speech did not calm either grief or anger,\r\nbut it brought on submission. I don’t know whether I had the tone of\r\neloquence, but certain I am I had not the action: one hand employed for\r\nstrength, the other for love, what orator could pretend to gracefulness\r\nin such a situation? If you conceive it right, you must own, at least,\r\nit was very favourable for the attack: but I know nothing; and, as you\r\nsay, the simplest creature, a boarding school girl, would lead me like\r\na child.\r\n\r\nShe was in the utmost affliction, but felt the necessity of coming to\r\nsome resolution, and entering into a composition. Being inexorable to\r\nprayers, she proceeded to offers: you think, perhaps. I sold this\r\nimportant post very dear; by no means; I promised every thing for a\r\nkiss; however, the kiss taken, I did not keep my word; my reasons were\r\ngood: it had not been agreed whether it should be given or taken; by\r\ndint of bargaining we agreed on a second, and that was to be received;\r\nthen guiding her trembling arms round me, and pressing her with one of\r\nmine more amorously, the soft kiss was not only received, but perfectly\r\nreceived in such a manner, that love could not have done it better.—So\r\nmuch plain dealing deserved to be rewarded, and I immediately granted\r\nthe request: the hand was withdrawn, but, I don’t know by what\r\naccident, I found myself in its place. You now suppose me very alert,\r\nand in great haste, don’t you?—Not in the least; I have already told\r\nyou I delight in delays: when one is once certain of coming to the end\r\nof the journey, what occasion for haste?\r\n\r\nSeriously, I was glad, for once, to observe the power of opportunity;\r\nand it was here divested of all foreign aid. She had, however, love to\r\ncombat with; and love, supported by modesty and shame, strengthened by\r\nthe bad humour I had put her in. There was nothing in my favour but\r\nopportunity;—it was there, always ready, always present, and love\r\nabsent.\r\n\r\nTo be certain in my observations, I was so mischievous to employ no\r\nmore force than what could be easily combated: only, if my charming\r\nenemy, abusing my condescension, attempted to escape me, I kept\r\nher in awe, by the same dread whose happy effects I had already\r\nexperienced.—At length the tender, lovely girl, without farther\r\ntrouble, first complied, and then consented: not but that, after the\r\nfirst moment, reproaches and tears returned together—I can’t tell\r\nwhether true or feigned; but, as it always happens, they ceased as\r\nsoon as I began to give fresh cause for them. At last, from weakness\r\nto reproach, and from reproach to weakness, we separated, perfectly\r\nsatisfied with each other, and equally agreed for the rendezvous this\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nI retired to my apartment at the dawn of day, quite exhausted with\r\nfatigue and sleep; yet I sacrificed one and the other to my inclination\r\nto be at breakfast in the morning. I am passionately fond of the next\r\nday’s exhibition. You cannot conceive any thing like this. It was\r\na confusion in the countenance, a difficulty in the walk, dejected\r\neyes so swelled, and the round visage so lengthened, nothing could\r\nbe so grotesque; and the mother, for the first time, alarmed at this\r\nsudden alteration, seemed to show a deal of affection for her; and the\r\nPresidente also, who seemed to be much concerned for her. As to her\r\ncares, they are only lent; for the day will come, and it is not far\r\noff, when they may be returned to her.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my lovely friend!\r\n\r\n_Oct._ 1, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCVII.\r\n\r\nCecilia Volanges _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nAh, Madam! I am the most miserable creature on earth; my affliction\r\nis very great, indeed. To whom shall I fly for consolation? or who\r\nwill give me advice in my distress? Mr. de Valmont and Danceny—the\r\nvery name of Danceny distracts me—How shall I begin? How shall I\r\ntell you?—I don’t know how to go about it; my heart is full—I must,\r\nhowever, disburthen myself to some one: and you are the only person in\r\nwhom I can or dare confide; you have been so kind to me. But I am no\r\nlonger worthy of your friendship; I will even say, I do not wish for\r\nit. Every one here has been uneasy about me, and they only augmented my\r\ngrief; I am so convinced I am unworthy of it. Rather scold me, abuse\r\nme, for I am guilty; yet save me from ruin. If you do not compassionate\r\nand advise me, I shall expire of grief.\r\n\r\nI must tell you then—my hand shakes so, I can hardly hold the pen, and\r\nI am as red as scarlet; but it is the blush of shame. Well, I will bear\r\nit, as the first punishment of my crime. I will relate the whole.\r\n\r\nI must tell you that Mr. Valmont, who has always hitherto delivered\r\nme Mr. Danceny’s letters, on a sudden discovered so much difficulty\r\nin it, that he would have the key of my chamber. I assure you, I was\r\nvery much against it: but he wrote to Danceny about it; and Danceny\r\nalso insisted on it. It gives me so much pain to refuse him any thing,\r\nespecially since our absence, which makes him so unhappy, that I\r\nconsented; not in the least suspecting what would be the consequence.\r\n\r\nYesterday Mr. Valmont made use of this key to get into my chamber while\r\nI was asleep. I so little expected such a visit, that I was greatly\r\nfrightened at waking: but as he spoke to me instantly, I knew him, and\r\ndid not cry out; as I immediately thought he came to bring me a letter\r\nfrom Danceny. No such thing. He wanted to kiss me directly; and while I\r\nwas struggling, he contrived to do what I would not have suffered for\r\nthe whole world. But he would have a kiss first; which I was forced\r\nto comply with: for what could I do? I endeavoured to call out; but,\r\nbesides that I could not, he told me, that if any one should come he\r\nwould throw all the fault on me; which, indeed, was very easy to be\r\ndone on account of the key. After that, he did not go away any more.\r\nThen he would have a second kiss; and I don’t know how that was, but\r\nit gave me a strange perturbation; and after that it was still worse.\r\nAt last, after—but you must excuse me from telling the rest; for I am\r\nas unhappy as it is possible. But what I reproach myself most for, and\r\nthat I can’t help mentioning, is, I am afraid I did not make as much\r\nresistance as I could. I can’t tell how it was, for certainly I don’t\r\nlove Mr. Valmont, but on the contrary; yet there were some moments that\r\nI was as if I lov’d him—however, you may well think I always said no:\r\nbut I was sensible I did not do as I said; and it was as if in spite\r\nof me; and I was, moreover, in great trouble. If it is always so hard\r\nto defend one’s self, one must be very well used to it. Mr. de Valmont\r\nspeaks to one in such a way, that one does not know how to answer him:\r\nand would you believe it, when he went away I was vexed; and yet I was\r\nsilly enough to consent to his coming again this night: that afflicts\r\nme more than all the rest.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, I promise you I will prevent him from coming. He was\r\nhardly gone, but I found I did very wrong to promise him, and I cried\r\nall the rest of the time. My greatest trouble is about Danceny. Every\r\ntime I think of him, my tears almost choke me, and I am always thinking\r\nof him—and even now you may see the effect, for the paper is wet with\r\nmy tears. I shall never be able to get the better of it, if it was only\r\non his account. I was quite exhausted, and yet I could not close my\r\neyes. When I got up, and looked in the glass, I was enough to frighten\r\none, I was so altered.\r\n\r\nMama perceived it as soon as I appeared, and asked me, what was the\r\nmatter with me? I burst out crying immediately. I thought she would\r\nhave chid me, and maybe that would not have been so distressing to me;\r\nhowever, it was quite otherwise; she spoke to me with great mildness,\r\nwhich I did not deserve. She desired I would not afflict myself so;\r\nbut she did not know the cause of my distress; and that I should make\r\nmyself sick. I often wish I was dead. I could hold out no longer.\r\nI flung myself in her arms, sobbing, and told her, “Ah, mama! your\r\ndaughter is very unhappy.” Mama could no longer contain herself, and\r\nwept a little. All this increased my sorrow. Fortunately she did not\r\nask the reason; for if she had, I should not known what to say.\r\n\r\nI entreat you, dear Madam, to write to me as soon as possible, and\r\ninform me how I am to act; for I have no power to think of any thing,\r\nmy affliction is so great. Please to enclose your letter to Mr.\r\nValmont: but if you write to him at the same time, I entreat you not to\r\nmention a word of this.\r\n\r\nI have the honour to be, with great friendship, Madam, your most humble\r\nand obedient servant.\r\n\r\nI dare not sign this letter.\r\n\r\n_Oct._ 1, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCVIII.\r\n\r\nMadame de Volanges _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days ago you applied to me, my charming friend, for advice and\r\nconsolation; it is now my turn, and I am to make the same request you\r\nmade to me for myself. I am really in great affliction, and fear I have\r\nnot taken the proper steps to avoid my present sorrow.\r\n\r\nMy uneasiness is on account of my daughter. Since our departure, I\r\nobserved she was always dejected and melancholy; that I expected, and\r\nassumed a severity of behaviour which I judged necessary; flattering\r\nmyself, that absence and dissipation would soon banish an affection,\r\nwhich I viewed as a childish error, rather than a deep-rooted passion;\r\nbut I am disappointed in my expectations, and observe she gives way\r\nmore and more to a dangerous dejection. I am seriously alarmed for\r\nher health. These few days past, particularly, there is a visible\r\nalteration in her; and yesterday she affected me very much, and alarmed\r\nus all.\r\n\r\nThe strongest proof I have of her being sensibly affected, is because\r\nI find that awe she always stood in of me is greatly diminished.\r\nYesterday morning, on my only asking her if she was indisposed, she\r\nflung herself in my arms, saying, she was very unhappy, and sobbed\r\nand cried piteously. You can’t conceive my grief; my eyes filled\r\nimmediately; I had scarcely time to turn about, to prevent her seeing\r\nme. Fortunately, I had the prudence not to ask her any questions,\r\nand she did not venture to say any thing more; nevertheless, I am\r\nconfident it is this unhappy passion disturbs her.\r\n\r\nWhat resolution to take, if it should last, I know not. Shall I be the\r\ncause of my child’s unhappiness? Shall the most delicate sensations of\r\nthe mind, tenderness and constancy, be employed against her? Is this\r\nthe duty of a mother? Were I even to stifle the natural inclination\r\nthat induces us to seek our children’s happiness; should I call that\r\nweakness, which I am persuaded is the first, the most sacred duty?\r\nShould I force her inclinations, am I not answerable for the dreadful\r\nconsequences that may ensue? What abuse of my maternal authority would\r\nit not be to place my daughter between guilt and misery!\r\n\r\nMy dear friend, I will not imitate what I have so often condemned.\r\nI was certainly authorised to choose for my daughter; in that, I\r\nonly assisted her with my experience: I did not mean to use it as\r\na right; I only fulfilled a duty, which I should have counteracted,\r\nhad I disposed of her in contempt of an inclination which I could not\r\nprevent, the extent and duration of which neither she or I can foresee.\r\nNo; she shall never marry Gercourt and love Danceny; I will much rather\r\nexpose my authority than her virtue.\r\n\r\nI am, then, of opinion, it will be the most prudent way to recall my\r\npromise to M. de Gercourt. You have my reasons which, I think, stronger\r\nthan my promise. I will go farther; for as matters are circumstanced,\r\nby fulfilling my engagement I should in reality violate it: for if I\r\nam bound to keep my daughter’s secret from M. de Gercourt, I am also\r\nbound not to abuse the ignorance I leave him in, and to act for him,\r\nas I believe he would act himself, was he better informed. Should I,\r\nthen, injuriously deceive him, when he reposes his confidence in me,\r\nand, whilst he honours me with the title of mother, deceive him in\r\nthe choice he makes for his children? Those reflections, so just in\r\nthemselves, and which I cannot withstand, give me more uneasiness than\r\nI can express.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the misfortunes I dread, I picture to myself my daughter\r\nhappy in the choice her heart has made, fulfilling her duties with\r\npleasure; my son-in-law, equally satisfied, daily congratulating\r\nhimself on his choice; each enjoying the other’s happiness, and both\r\nuniting to augment mine. Should, then, the prospect of so charming\r\na futurity be sacrificed to vain motives? And what are those that\r\nrestrain me? Interest only. Where is, then, the advantage of my\r\ndaughter being born to a large fortune, if she is to be nevertheless\r\nthe slave to that fortune? I will allow, that M. de Gercourt is,\r\nperhaps, a better match than I could have expected for my daughter;\r\nI will even own, I was much pleased when he made her his choice: but\r\nDanceny is of as good a family as he, and is nothing inferior to him\r\nin personal accomplishments; he has, moreover, the advantage over M.\r\nde Gercourt of loving and being beloved. He is not rich, it’s true;\r\nbut my daughter is rich enough for both. Ah! Why should I deprive\r\nher the pleasure of making the fortune of the man she loves? Those\r\nmatches of convenience, as they are called, where certainly every\r\nthing is convenient except inclination and disposition, are they not\r\nthe most fruitful source of those scandalous rumours which are become\r\nso frequent? I would much rather defer matters a little. I shall have\r\nan opportunity to study my daughter’s disposition, which as yet I am\r\na stranger to. I have resolution enough to give her some temporary\r\nuneasiness, in order to make her enjoy some temporary happiness: but I\r\nwill not risk making her miserable for ever.\r\n\r\nThus, my dear friend, I have related to you my afflictions, on which I\r\nbeg your advice. Those severe subjects are a contrast to your amiable\r\ngaiety, and seem not at all adapted to your age; but your good sense\r\noutstrips your years. Your friendship will also aid your prudence; and\r\nI am confident, both will gratify the maternal anxiety that implores\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear friend! never doubt the sincerity of my sentiments.\r\n\r\n_Castle of_ ——, _Oct._ 2, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XCIX.\r\n\r\nViscount de Valmont _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrifling events still, my dear friend; nothing of consequence; no\r\naction; scenes only; therefore arm yourself with patience: you must\r\ntake a large dose; for whilst my Presidente goes such a slow pace, your\r\npupil slides back, which is much worse: but I am of that happy temper,\r\nI can divert myself with all this nonsense. I really begin to be very\r\ncomfortable here; and can assure you, I have not experienced a tedious\r\nmoment in my old aunt’s melancholy castle. What could I wish for more\r\nthan what I have, enjoyments, privations, hope, and incertitude? What\r\nmore is to be had on a grand theatre? Why spectators. Ah! a little\r\npatience, they will not be wanting. If they do not see me at work, they\r\nshall at least see my work completed; they will then have nothing to do\r\nbut to admire and applaud: for they shall applaud. I can this instant\r\nwith certainty foretell the moment of my austere devotee’s fall. I\r\nthis night assisted at the last agonies of her virtue; soft weakness\r\nhas replaced it. I have fixed its epocha, at farthest, to our next\r\ninterview: you will call this pride. He announces his victory before he\r\nhas gained it! Softly; be calm! To give you a proof of my modesty, I\r\nwill give you the history of my defeat.\r\n\r\nUpon my word, your little pupil is a most ridiculous being. She is\r\nreally a child, and should be treated as one; it would be of service\r\nto enjoin her a little penance. Would you believe it? after what\r\npassed between us the day before yesterday, after the amicable manner\r\nin which we parted yesterday morning, I found her door locked on the\r\ninside when I came at night, as was agreed. What do you think of that?\r\nThose childish tricks are passable on the eve; but on the morrow is\r\nit not ridiculous? I did not, however, laugh at first; for never\r\ndid I feel the ascendancy of my character more hurt. I went to this\r\nrendezvous without any incitement for pleasure, and merely through\r\ndecency; my own bed, which I much wanted at that time, was preferable\r\nto any other, and I parted from it with some reluctance; yet when I met\r\nthis obstacle I was all on fire to surmount it: I was humbled, to be\r\nsported with by a child. I was obliged to retire in very bad humour,\r\nfully resolved to have nothing more to do with this silly girl, or\r\nher matters. I immediately wrote her a note, which I intended giving\r\nher this day, wherein I appreciated her as she deserved: but night\r\nbringing good counsel, as is said, I reflected this morning, that not\r\nhaving here a choice of dissipations, it was better to keep this, and\r\nsuppressed my note. Since I have reflected on it, I can’t reconcile\r\nit to myself to have had the idea of putting an end to an adventure\r\nbefore I had it in my power to ruin the heroine. What lengths will not\r\na first emotion carry us to! Happy are those, my dear friend, who, like\r\nyou, never accustom themselves to give way to it. I have deferred my\r\nrevenge; and this sacrifice I make to your designs on Gercourt.\r\n\r\nNow my wrath is subsided, I only see the ridiculousness of your pupil’s\r\nbehaviour. I should be fond to know what she expects to gain by it;\r\nfor my part, I am at a loss: if it should be to make a defence, she is\r\nrather late. She must explain this enigma to me one day or other, for\r\nI must be satisfied. It is only, perhaps, that she was fatigued; and\r\nreally that may be the case, for certainly she does not yet know that\r\nthe shafts of love, like the lance of Achilles, carry with them the\r\nremedy for the wounds they give. But no: I will engage by her little\r\nmien all day, that there is something like repentance; a something like\r\nvirtue—virtue, indeed!—she is a pretty creature to pretend to virtue!\r\nAh! she must leave that to the only woman who was truly born for it,\r\nknows how to embellish it, and make it revered. Your pardon, my dear\r\nfriend: but this very evening it was that the scene between Madame de\r\nTourvel and me happened, of which I am about giving you an account,\r\nand which has still left me in great emotion. It is not without some\r\nviolence I endeavour to dissipate the impression it has left on me; it\r\nis even to assist it, I sit down to write to you: you must make some\r\nallowance for this first impulse.\r\n\r\nFor some days past Madame de Tourvel and I have been agreed about our\r\nsentiments, and we no longer dispute on any thing but words. It was\r\nalways, _her friendship_ that answered _my love:_ but this conventional\r\nlanguage made no alteration in the meaning of things. Had we even\r\nstill remained so, I should not have gone on, perhaps, with so much\r\ndispatch, but with no less certainty. There was no longer any thought\r\nof putting me from hence, as was at first mentioned; and as to our\r\ndaily conversations, if I am solicitous to offer opportunities, she\r\ntakes care not to let them slip.\r\n\r\nIt is usually in our walks our rendezvous occur; the bad weather we had\r\nall day left no room for hope; I was much disappointed at it, and did\r\nnot foresee how much it was in my favour. Not being able to walk, after\r\ndinner they sat down to cards; as I seldom play, and was not wanted, I\r\nretired to my room, with no other design than to wait till the party\r\nwas over. I was returning to join the company, when the charming\r\nwoman, who was going into her apartment, whether through weakness or\r\nimprudence, said in a soft manner, “Where are you going? There is no\r\none in the saloon.” That was sufficient, you may believe, for me to\r\nendeavour to go in with her. I found less reluctance than expected:\r\nit’s true, I had the precaution to begin the conversation at the door\r\non indifferent matters; but we were scarcely settled when I began the\r\ntrue one, and I spoke _of my love to my friend._ “Oh,” says she, “let\r\nus not speak of that here;” and trembled. Poor woman! she sees herself\r\ngoing.\r\n\r\nYet she was in the wrong to have had any terrors. For some time past\r\nbeing certain of success one day or other, and seeing her employ so\r\nmuch exertion in useless struggles, I resolved to reserve mine, and\r\nwait without effort her surrender from lassitude. You already know\r\nI must have a complete triumph, and that I will not be indebted to\r\nopportunity. It was even after the formation of this plan, and in order\r\nto be pressing without engaging too far, I reverted to the word love,\r\nso obstinately resisted. Being assured my ardour was not questioned,\r\nI assumed a milder strain. This refusal no longer vexed me, it only\r\nafflicted me; my tender friend should give me some consolations. As\r\nshe consoled me, one hand remained in mine, the lovely body rested on\r\nmy arm, and we were exceeding close together. You must have certainly\r\nremarked, how much in such a situation, as the defence abates, the\r\ndemands and refusals draw nearer; how the head turns aside, the looks\r\ncast down, whilst the conversation, always pronounced in a weak tone,\r\nbecomes scarce and interrupted. Those precious symptoms announce, in an\r\nunequivocal manner, the consent of the mind, but rarely has it reached\r\nthe senses. I even think it always dangerous to attempt any enterprise\r\nof consequence; because this state of abandonment being always\r\naccompanied with the softest pleasure, cannot be disturbed without\r\nruffling the temper, which infallibly decides in favour of the defence.\r\n\r\nBut in the present case, prudence was so much more necessary, as I\r\nhad every thing to dread from the forgetfulness of the danger this\r\nabandonment would occasion to my tender pensive devotee; and the avowal\r\nI solicited I did not even require to be pronounced; a look would\r\nsuffice; a single glance would crown my happiness.\r\n\r\nMy charming friend, those lovely eyes then were raised on me, that\r\ncelestial mouth even pronounced—“Well; yes, I—” in an instant the\r\nlook was extinct, the voice failed, and this adorable woman dropped in\r\nmy arms. I had scarcely time to receive her, when disengaging herself\r\nwith a convulsive force and wild look, her hands raised to heaven,\r\nshe exclaimed, “God—Oh, my God, save me!” and instantly, as quick as\r\nlightning, was on her knees ten paces from me. I could hear her almost\r\nsuffocating. I came forward to assist her: but seizing my hands, which\r\nshe bathed with her tears, sometimes embracing my knees, “Yes it is\r\nyou,” said she, “it is you will save me; you do not wish my death;\r\nleave me; save me; leave me; for God’s sake! leave me:” and those\r\nincoherent expressions were brought out with most affecting sobs;\r\nyet still she held me so strong I could not get from her; however,\r\nmaking an effort, I rais’d her in my arms: instantly her tears ceas’d;\r\nshe could not speak, her joints stiffened, and violent convulsions\r\nsucceeded this storm.\r\n\r\nI must own, I was exceedingly moved, and believe I should have complied\r\nwith her request, if the circumstances had not even obliged me to it.\r\nBut this much is certain; after having given her some assistance, I\r\nleft her, as she desired; and I am well pleased with myself for it. I\r\nhave already received almost my reward.\r\n\r\nI expected, as on the first day of my declaration, I should not see\r\nher any more for the evening; but she came down to the saloon about\r\neight, and only told the company she had been much indisposed: her\r\ncountenance was dejected, her voice weak, her deportment composed,\r\nbut her look mild, and often fixed on me.—As she declined playing, I\r\nwas obliged to take her seat, and she placed herself beside me. During\r\nsupper she remained alone in the saloon. At our return, I thought\r\nI perceived she had been crying: to be satisfied, I told her I was\r\nafraid she still felt some uneasiness from her disorder, to which she\r\nobligingly answered, “Her disorder would not go so quickly as it came.”\r\nAt last, when we retired, I gave her my hand, and at the door of her\r\napartment, she very forcibly squeez’d mine: it is true, this motion\r\nseemed to me to be involuntary; so much the better; it is a stronger\r\nproof of my power.\r\n\r\nI am confident she is now happy to have gone such a length; all\r\nexpences are paid; nothing now remains but enjoyment. Perhaps now,\r\nwhilst I am writing to you, she is possessed with the soft idea; but,\r\nif she should even be engaged in a new scheme of defence, you and I\r\nknow how such projects end. Now let me ask you, can things be put off\r\nlonger than our next interview? I expect there will be some forms to\r\nbe settled; but, the first difficulties surmounted, do those austere\r\nprudes know where to stop? Their affections are real explosions;\r\nresistance gives them strength; my untractable devotee would run after\r\nme, if I ceas’d running after her.\r\n\r\nAt length, my lovely friend, I shall soon call on you for the\r\nperformance of your promise; you undoubtedly remember our agreement\r\nafter my success; this trifling infidelity to your Chevalier.—Are\r\nyou ready? I wish for it as passionately as if I had never known you.\r\nHowever, knowing you is, perhaps, a stronger motive for wishing for it.\r\n\r\n    I am just, and no galant.[1]\r\n\r\nIt shall be the first infidelity I shall commit against my solemn\r\nconquest; and, I promise you, I will embrace the first pretence to be\r\nabsent from her four and twenty hours: that shall be her punishment for\r\nhaving kept me so long distant from her: It is now more than two months\r\nI have been taken up with this adventure: ay, two months and three\r\ndays, including to-morrow, as it will not be really consummated until\r\nthen. This brings to my memory, that Mademoiselle B—— held out three\r\ncomplete months. I am pleased to find sheer coquetry can make a longer\r\ndefence than austere virtue.\r\n\r\nAdieu, charmer! I must leave off, for it is very late. This letter has\r\nled me farther than I intended; but, as I send to Paris to-morrow, I\r\nwould not miss the opportunity of letting you partake a day sooner of\r\nyour friend’s good success.\r\n\r\n_Oct._ 2, 17—, _at Night._\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Voltaire’s comedy of Nanine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER C.\r\n\r\n_The_ Viscount de Valmont _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear friend! I am betrayed, bubbled, ruined; I am enraged beyond\r\nexpression: Madame de Tourvel is gone off. She is gone, and I knew\r\nnothing of it! I was not in the way to oppose her, to reproach her with\r\nher base treachery! Do not imagine I should have let her go quietly;\r\nshe should have staid, had I been even obliged to have used force. Fool\r\nas I was! I slept peaceably, wrapped in a credulous security! I slept\r\nwhilst the thunder struck me! I cannot conceive the meaning of this\r\nabrupt departure; I will for ever renounce the knowledge of women.\r\n\r\nWhen I recall the transactions of yesterday!—or rather the\r\nevening—the melting look, the tender voice, the squeezing the\r\nhand—all the while planning her flight.—Oh! woman, woman! complain,\r\nthen, if you are deceived! Yes, every kind of treachery that is\r\nemployed against you is a robbery committed on you.\r\n\r\nWith what rapture shall I be revenged! I shall again meet this\r\nperfidious woman; I will resume my power over her. If love has been\r\nsufficient to furnish the means, what is it not capable of when\r\nassisted with revenge? I shall again see her at my knees, trembling,\r\nand bath’d in tears! calling on me for pity with her deceitful voice;\r\nand I will have none for her.\r\n\r\nWhat is she now doing? What can she think of? Perhaps applauding\r\nherself for having deceived me; and, true to the genius of her sex,\r\nenjoys that pleasure in the highest degree. What her boasted virtue\r\ncould not effect, deceit has accomplished without a struggle; it was\r\nher disingenuity I should have dreaded.—Then, to be obliged to stifle\r\nmy resentment; to be obliged to affect a tender sorrow, when my heart\r\nis possessed with rage. Reduced to supplicate a rebellious woman,\r\nwho has withdrawn herself from my obedience! Ought I then be so much\r\nhumbled? And by whom? By a weak woman, who was never accustomed to\r\nresist! What avails my having possession of her heart, having inflamed\r\nit with the whole fire of love, having raised her feelings even to\r\nintoxication; if, calm in her retreat, she can now be prouder of her\r\nflight than I of my victories? And must I bear this? My dear friend,\r\nyou will not believe it; you will not, surely, have such a humiliating\r\nopinion of me!\r\n\r\nWhat fatality attaches me to this woman? Are there not a hundred others\r\nwho wish I would pay attention to them, and eagerly accept it? If\r\neven none were so enchanting, the charms of variety, the allurements\r\nof new conquests, the splendour of the number; do not they afford a\r\nplentiful harvest of soft pleasures? Why, then, do I run madding after\r\nthis one that flies me, and neglect those that offer? I am at a loss\r\nto account for it, but so it is.—There is no happiness, no repose\r\nfor me, until I possess this woman, whom I love and hate with equal\r\nrage. I shall not be able to support my fate until I have disposed of\r\nhers: then, tranquil and satiated, I shall behold her a prey to the\r\nravages I now experience, and will raise a thousand others; hope and\r\nfear, diffidence and security, all evils the offspring of hatred, all\r\nthe gifts that love can bestow, shall alternately engross her heart\r\nat my will. The time will come——But what labours have I not yet to\r\nencounter?—How near was I yesterday, and how distant to-day! How am I\r\nto regain the ground I have lost? I dare not undertake any one step:\r\nto come to some resolution I should be calm, and my blood boils in my\r\nveins.\r\n\r\nThe calm serenity with which every one replies to my demands on this\r\nextraordinary, on this uncommon event, and its cause, adds to my\r\ntorments.—No one knows the reason: none seem to give themselves the\r\nleast uneasiness about it; it scarcely would have been mentioned, could\r\nI have started any other subject. I flew to Madame de Rosemonde the\r\nmoment I heard the news, who replied, with the natural indifference\r\nof old age, it was the consequence of the indisposition Madame de\r\nTourvel had suffered yesterday: she dreaded a fit of illness, and\r\nwished to be at home; a resolution she did not think proper to oppose,\r\nas she would have done on a similar occasion; as if the contrast was\r\napplicable,—between her who should think of nothing but futurity, and\r\nthe other, who is the delight and torment of my life.\r\n\r\nMadame de Volanges, who I had suspected at first of being an\r\naccomplice, seems dissatisfied for not having been consulted on this\r\noccasion. I must own I am very well pleased she has been disappointed\r\nof the pleasure of prejudicing me; which is still a stronger proof she\r\nhas not the confidence of this woman so much as I dreaded: that is an\r\nenemy the less. How would she have exulted, did she know she fled from\r\nme! How intolerable her pride, had it been the consequence of her\r\nadvice! To what an immensity would her importance have been raised!\r\nGood God! how I detest her!—Yes, I will renew my connection with the\r\ndaughter, and initiate her in her business: I believe I shall stay here\r\nsome time; I am at present inclined to this measure, in the tumult of\r\nreflections that crowd on me.\r\n\r\nDon’t you, really now, think, after so extraordinary a proceeding, my\r\nungrateful fair one should dread me? If she imagines I shall pursue\r\nher, she will not fail to prevent my admission; and, I can assure you,\r\nI am as little inclined to permit her such a custom, as to bear such\r\nan insult. I had much rather she should be told I remain here; I will\r\neven strenuously press her to return again: then, when she is fully\r\nconvinced I am far from her, I will suddenly come to her house, and\r\nabide the effect of my scheme.—That it may have its full force, it\r\nmust not be hurried; still I will not answer for my impatience; twenty\r\ntimes this day was I tempted to call for my horses. I will contain\r\nmyself, however, and wait your answer here; I only request, my lovely\r\nfriend, you will not let me wait long for it.\r\n\r\nWhat hurts me most is to be ignorant of what happens: my fellow, who\r\nis at Paris, has a claim on her waiting maid; he may be serviceable; I\r\nsend him money, and his instructions. Permit me to include both in this\r\nletter, and request to have them delivered into his hand by some of\r\nyour servants: this precaution is the more necessary, as the scoundrel\r\nhas a trick of never receiving any letters I write him on business he\r\nfinds troublesome; and, at this period, he does not seem to be quite so\r\nenraptured with his girl as I could wish him.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my lovely friend! If a happy thought should strike you, or any\r\nmeans of bringing me speedily to action, lose not a moment. I have\r\noften experienced your friendship; I forcibly experience it now, for I\r\nam more serene since I sat down to write. I speak, at least, to one who\r\ncomprehends me, not to the inanimate beings with whom I vegetate since\r\nthis morning. On my word, the more I proceed, the more I am inclined to\r\nthink we are the only couple worth any thing in this life.\r\n\r\n_Oct._ 3, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CI.\r\n\r\n_The_ Viscount de Valmont _to_ Azolan, _his Huntsman._\r\n\r\n(Enclosed in the foregoing.)\r\n\r\n\r\nYou must be a stupid fellow, indeed, to set out this morning, and not\r\nhave known that Madame de Tourvel was going away also; or, if you knew\r\nit, not to have given me notice. To what purpose is it, then, you spend\r\nmy money, if you only get drunk with the men, and loiter your time in\r\ncourting the waiting maids, if you do not give me better information\r\nof what is going forward?—This is entirely owing to your negligence;\r\ntherefore, I now give you notice, if such another happens in this\r\nbusiness, it shall be the last you will be guilty of in my service.\r\n\r\nYou must inform me of every thing that happens at Madame de Tourvel’s,\r\nrelative to her health; whether she sleeps well; whether she is\r\nmelancholy or cheerful; if she goes abroad often, and where; if she\r\nsees much company, and who goes there; how she passes her time; whether\r\nshe is out of temper with her women, particularly the one that was with\r\nher here; how she employs her time when alone; if, when she reads, she\r\nis composed, or stops to muse; and the same when she writes. Remember,\r\nalso, to make a friend of whoever carries the letters to the post\r\noffice: often do that business for him; and, when he accepts it, send\r\naway only those you think of no consequence, and send me the rest,\r\nespecially those for Madame de Volanges, if there should be any.\r\n\r\nSettle your matters so as to be still the favourite of Julia. If\r\nshe has another, as you thought, bring her to consent to share her\r\nfavours; and do not be so ridiculous as to give yourself airs of\r\njealousy: you will be only circumstanced as your superiors; but, if\r\nyour rival should be troublesome, or if you perceive he takes up too\r\nmuch of Julia’s time in the day, so that she should not be so often\r\nwith her mistress, to observe her, you must, by some means or other,\r\ndrive him away, or pick a quarrel with him; do not be afraid of the\r\nconsequences,—I will support you: above all, leave the house as\r\nlittle as possible; for it is by assiduity only you can make your\r\nobservations with certainty. If, by chance, any of the servants should\r\nbe discharged, offer yourself in their room, as if no longer in my\r\nservice: in such case, you must say you left me to get into a more\r\nquiet and regular service. Endeavour, as much as possible, to be\r\nhired; I shall, notwithstanding, keep you still in mine during the\r\ntime; and you will be as you was before at the Duchess of ——, and\r\nMadame de Tourvel will also reward you in the end.\r\n\r\nIf you was zealous and skilful, those instructions should be\r\nsufficient: but, to assist one and the other, I send you some money:\r\nthe enclosed bill on my steward entitles you to call on him for\r\ntwenty-five louis, for I suppose you have no money. You will make\r\nuse of as much as is necessary, to prevail on Julia to settle a\r\ncorrespondence with me; the remainder to treat the servants: let it be\r\nas often as you can in the porter’s lodge, that he may like to see you.\r\nHowever, do not forget, it is your services I mean to pay, and not your\r\npleasures.\r\n\r\nAccustom Julia, betimes, to observe and report every thing, even what\r\nshe may think the most trifling; it is better she should write ten\r\nuseless lines, than omit a material one; and what often appears a\r\nmatter of indifference, is quite otherwise. As I must be instantly\r\ninformed, if any thing should happen you think of consequence after you\r\nreceive this letter, send off Philip directly on the message horse, to\r\nfix himself at ——, and remain there until farther orders; it will be\r\na stage in case of necessity; but, for common correspondence, the post\r\nwill be sufficient.\r\n\r\nTake great care not to lose this letter; read it over every day; not\r\nonly not to forget any thing, but also to be certain you have it.\r\nDo, in a few words every thing you ought, now I honour you with my\r\nconfidence. You very well know, if I am satisfied with your conduct,\r\nyou shall be satisfied with me.\r\n\r\n_Oct._ 3. 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CII.\r\n\r\n_The_ Presidente de Tourvel _to_ Madame de Rosemonde.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will be very much surprised, dear Madam, to learn I quitted your\r\nhouse so precipitately: this proceeding will, doubtless, appear very\r\nextraordinary; but how will your astonishment be increased, when\r\nyou shall know my reasons! You will perhaps imagine, when I confide\r\nthem to you, I have not paid proper attention to the respect the\r\nnecessary tranquility of your age commands; that I am insensible to\r\nthe sentiments of veneration you are so justly entitled to from me.\r\nAh! forgive me, Madam! my heart is oppressed; it seeks to pour out its\r\ndistress into the friendly bosom of prudence and mildness:—where\r\ncould it find it but with you? Look upon me as your child; take a\r\nmaternal compassion on me; I implore it; my sentiments for you may give\r\nme a claim to it.\r\n\r\nThe time is fled, when, wholly possessed with those laudable ideas, I\r\nknew not these I now experience, which ravage the soul, and deprive me\r\nof the power of resistance, whilst they impose its necessity! Ah! this\r\nfatal visit has undone me!\r\n\r\nWhat can I say?—I love,—yes, I love to distraction! Alas! this fatal\r\nword, which now I write for the first time,—this word, so often\r\nsolicited but never granted, my life should now expiate to let him hear\r\nwho has inspired it; yet I must ever refuse! He will remain doubtful of\r\nthe sentiments I feel for him.—I am miserable!—Oh, that he could as\r\nreadily read my heart as rule it! I should suffer less if he but knew\r\nwhat I endure; but even you, my venerable friend, can have but a faint\r\nidea of my sufferings.\r\n\r\nI shall in a few minutes fly him, and load him with affliction. He will\r\nthink me near him, and I shall be far from him.—At the usual hour of\r\nseeing him every day, I shall be in places unknown to him, and where he\r\ncannot come: every thing is prepared full in my view, and all announce\r\nmy unhappy flight: all is ready but me!—and the more my heart recoils,\r\nthe more I am convinced of the necessity of submitting to my fate.—I\r\nmust submit; it is better to die than live in guilt: already I feel my\r\ncriminality; modesty only is preserved, but virtue is vanished:—what\r\nyet is left me, I must acknowledge, is due to his generosity.\r\nIntoxicated with pleasure, seeing and listening to him, enraptured in\r\nhis arms, and the greatest of all extacy, that of making him happy,\r\nI was diverted of strength or power; scarce any left to struggle, but\r\nnone to resist; I shuddered at my danger, but had not power to fly:—he\r\nsaw my sufferings, and had compassion on me.—Must I not cherish him to\r\nwhom I owe more than life!\r\n\r\nHad that been my only care, remaining with him, do not imagine I\r\nshould ever have thought of going! for what is life without him? Happy\r\nshould I have been to die for him! But, condemned to be the cause of\r\nhis misery and my own, without daring to complain, or console him; to\r\nbe daily exposed to struggle, not only against him, but also against\r\nmyself; to employ my cares to bring him to anguish, when I would devote\r\nmy days to make him happy: such a life is worse than a thousand deaths;\r\nyet this is to be my fate: I will still resolutely bear up against it.\r\nAnd do you, who I have chosen for a mother, receive my solemn vow to\r\nobserve it.\r\n\r\nReceive also another, of never concealing any of my actions from you. I\r\nbeseech you to accept it. I demand it as a necessary aid to my conduct.\r\nI shall be engaged to relate you all; I shall think myself in your\r\npresence; your virtue will assist my weakness. I will never consent to\r\nshame in your sight; and by means of this powerful restraint, whilst\r\nI cherish the indulgent friend, the confidant of my weakness, I shall\r\nreverence my tutelar angel that guards me from shame.\r\n\r\nIt is experiencing it too fatally, to be compelled to this requisition.\r\nOh, the unhappy effect of presumptuous confidence! Why did I not oppose\r\nsooner this growing inclination? Why did I flatter myself with being\r\nable to conquer it at my pleasure? Senseless wretch! Little did I know\r\nthe power of love! Ah! had I struggled against it with more care, it\r\nwould not have overpowered me. This sudden departure would have been\r\nunnecessary; or, even being compelled to this painful step, I might\r\nnot have been forced to break a connection, which might have been\r\nless frequent. But to lose all at once, and for ever!—Oh, my dear\r\nfriend!—I forget myself, and again wander in criminal wishes. Let us\r\npart; and, at least, let me expiate by my sacrifice those involuntary\r\ninjuries.\r\n\r\nAdieu, most respectable friend! Love me as a daughter; adopt me as one;\r\nand be assured, notwithstanding my weakness, I would rather die than be\r\nunworthy that name.\r\n\r\n_Oct._ 3, 17—, _One in the morning._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CIII.\r\n\r\nMadame de Rosemonde _to the_ Presidente de Tourvel.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was more afflicted, my lovely dear, at your departure, than surprised\r\nat the cause; long experience, and my concern for you, had sufficiently\r\ninformed me the state of your heart; and to sum up all, you have told\r\nme almost nothing in your letter but what I feared. Was I to depend on\r\nit for information, I should still be ignorant who it is you love; for\r\nin speaking of _him_ all the time, you never once mention his name.\r\nIt was not necessary; too well I know who it is. This I remark only,\r\nbecause I recollect, it always has been the language of love. I see\r\nthings are the same as they were formerly.\r\n\r\nI little imagined my thoughts would ever be called back to things so\r\nforeign to my age, and so much out of my memory. Since yesterday,\r\nhowever, my mind has been much taken up with it, in order to find out\r\nsomething that may be useful to you. What can I then do, but admire and\r\npity you? I am charmed with your proceeding; yet terrified because you\r\nthought it indispensable; and when things have gone so far, it is a\r\ndifficult matter to avoid those our hearts are continually drawing us\r\ntowards.\r\n\r\nHowever, you must not be discouraged; nothing is impossible to such\r\na virtuous mind; and were you ever to yield, (which God forbid!) you\r\nwill at least, my lovely dear, have the consolation of having resisted\r\nwith all your might; moreover, what human wisdom cannot accomplish,\r\nthe divine grace operates when it pleases. You are, perhaps, now at\r\nthe eve of your deliverance; and your virtue, which has been tried\r\nin those dreadful conflicts, will arise more pure and refined. The\r\nstrength which forsakes you to-day, you must hope for to-morrow. Do\r\nnot, however, depend on it; use it only as an incentive to encourage\r\nyou to employ all your own.\r\n\r\nLeaving to Providence the care of assisting you in a danger where\r\nI can bring no prevention, I reserve to myself that of supporting\r\nand consoling you as much as in my power. I cannot relieve your\r\ntroubles, but I will share them. On those conditions I will accept\r\nyour confidence. I know your heart wants to be disburthened; I offer\r\nyou my own; age has not so far frozen it, as to leave it insensible to\r\nfriendship: you will always find it open to receive you. This is a poor\r\nrelief to your distress, but you shall not, however, weep alone; and\r\nwhen this unhappy passion overpowers you, and obliges you to speak, it\r\nwill be better it should be with me than _him._ Now I speak as you do;\r\nand I believe between us both we shall not be able to name him, but we\r\nunderstand each other.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether I do right in telling you he appeared amazingly\r\naffected as your sudden departure; it would, perhaps, be better not\r\nto mention it: but I am not fond of that prudence that afflicts one’s\r\nfriends. I am obliged to stop short on that subject; for the weakness\r\nof my sight and a trembling hand will not indulge long letters, when I\r\nam under the necessity of writing them myself.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my lovely dear! Adieu, my amiable child! I adopt you freely as a\r\ndaughter. You have every accomplishment to fill a mother’s heart with\r\npride and pleasure.\r\n\r\n_Oct._ 3, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CIV.\r\n\r\n_The_ Marchioness de Merteuil _to_ Madame de Volanges.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was with some difficulty, my dear worthy friend, I could suppress\r\nan impulse of pride on reading your letter. You honour me, then, with\r\nyour full confidence; you even condescend to ask my advice. I should\r\nbe completely happy if I merited this favourable opinion; or, that it\r\ndid not proceed from the prepossession of your friendship. Whatever\r\nmay be the motive, it is so flattering, that having obtained it, I\r\nshall endeavour more ardently to deserve it. I shall then, but without\r\npresuming to advise, tell you freely my thoughts. I own I am diffident\r\nof them, as they differ from yours; yet, when you have my reasons, you\r\nwill then judge, and if they should not meet with your approbation,\r\nI declare beforehand I submit. I shall, at least, be so prudent as\r\nnot to think myself wiser than you. However, for this once, if my\r\nopinion should have the preference, you will find the cause in the\r\nfacility of maternal fondness. With you we must look for so laudable an\r\ninclination, and readily recognize it in the measure you are inclined\r\nto embrace. Thus if you sometimes err, it is always on the side of\r\nvirtue.\r\n\r\nWhen we are to decide on the lot of others, but more especially, when\r\nthe question is to fix it by a sacred and indissoluble band, such\r\nas marriage, prudence, I think, ought to take place of all other\r\nconsiderations. It is then an equally wise and tender mother should, as\r\nyou well observe, _assist her daughter with her own experience._ I ask\r\nthen, how is she to attain it, but by making a distinction between what\r\nis pleasing and what convenient.\r\n\r\nWould it not be debasing maternal authority, nay even annihilating\r\nit, to make it subservient to a frivolous inclination, whose illusive\r\npower is felt only by those that dread it, and immediately vanishes\r\nwhen contemptuously treated? For my part, I must own I never believed\r\nin those irresistible, impetuous passions, which one would imagine the\r\nworld has adopted, as an universal excuse for their irregularities.\r\nI cannot conceive how a passion, that one moment creates, and the\r\nnext destroys, can overpower the unalterable principles of chastity,\r\ndecency and modesty; nor how a woman, that has relinquished them,\r\ncan be justified by a pretended passion, no more than a robber for a\r\nthirst for money, or a murderer for a desire of revenge. Where is the\r\nperson who has not had their struggles? I have been always persuaded,\r\ninclination was sufficient for resistance, and experience has confirmed\r\nmy opinion. Of what estimation would virtue be, without the obligations\r\nit imposes? Its worship are our sacrifices, its reward in our hearts.\r\nThose incontestable truths can be denied only by those whose interest\r\nit is to forget them; and who being already contaminated, hope to carry\r\non the illusion, and justify their bad conduct by worse reasoning.\r\n\r\nBut is this to be apprehended from an innocent timid child; from a\r\nchild of yours, whose pure and modest education is strengthened by\r\na happy disposition? Still it is to this apprehension, which I will\r\nventure to call very humiliating for your daughter, you would give\r\nup an advantageous match your prudence had provided. I have a great\r\nfriendship for Danceny; and you know for some time past I have seldom\r\nseen M. de Gercourt: but my friendship for the one, nor my indifference\r\nfor the other, can prevent me from observing the immense difference\r\nbetween the two matches.\r\n\r\nAs to birth, I agree with you, they are on an equality: but the one is\r\ndeficient in fortune, and the other’s is such as, exclusive of blood,\r\nis sufficient to raise him to the highest employments. I acknowledge,\r\nhappiness may be independent of fortune; but we must also own it a very\r\nnecessary ingredient. You say, Mademoiselle de Volanges is rich enough\r\nfor both; yet sixty thousand livres per annum, which she is to possess,\r\nwill not be too much for one who bears the name of Danceny, to furnish\r\nand keep up a house suitable to it. These are not Madame de Sévigné’s\r\ndays. Luxury absorbs every thing; we blame, yet imitate it; and our\r\nsuperfluities end in depriving us of necessaries. As to personal\r\naccomplishments, which you with great reason dwell much on, certainly\r\non that point M. de Gercourt is irreproachable, which he has already\r\nproved. I am fond of thinking, and really believe Danceny is not his\r\ninferior; but are we so certain of it? It is true, hitherto he appears\r\nuntainted with the follies of the age, and notwithstanding the ton of\r\nthe day, he shows a taste for good company, which inclines one to judge\r\nfavourably of him. Yet who knows whether this apparent discretion is\r\nnot the result of the mediocrity of his income? To be a gamester or\r\na libertine, money must be had; or if there should be a tincture of\r\nknavery or epicurism, one may be fond of the defects, and still dread\r\ntheir excess. There are thousands who are admitted into good company\r\nbecause they have no other employment.\r\n\r\nI do not say, God forbid I should! that I believe such things of him:\r\nyet there is some danger; and if the event should not answer your\r\nexpectations, how you would reproach yourself! What reply could you\r\nmake to your daughter, who would probably say, “Mother, I was young\r\nand unexperienced; I was even led astray by an error excusable at\r\nmy age: Providence, which had foreseen my incapacity, had given me\r\na prudent mother to preserve me. How is it then, that laying your\r\ndiscretion aside, you have consented to make me unhappy? Was I to\r\nchoose a husband, I who knew nothing of a married state? If even I\r\nwas determined on it, should you not have opposed it? But I never\r\nwas possessed with that foolish self will. Determined to obey you,\r\nI waited with respectful veneration your choice. Did I ever swerve\r\nfrom my submission? Yet now I suffer the afflictions due to rebellious\r\nchildren only. Your weakness has been my ruin.” Perhaps her respect\r\nmight stifle those complaints: but your maternal love would discover\r\nthem; and your daughter’s tears, though concealed, would still\r\noverwhelm your heart.\r\n\r\nWhere then will you seek consolation? Will it be in this ridiculous\r\npassion, against which you should have guarded her, by which you even\r\nsuffer yourself to be seduced?\r\n\r\nPerhaps I may, my dear friend, conceive too strong a prejudice against\r\nthis attachment: I view it in a formidable light, even in case of a\r\nmarriage. Not that I disapprove a decent and pure intention should\r\nembellish the matrimonial bands, to soften in some measure the\r\nobligations it requires: but he is not the man appointed to tie them;\r\nit is not an illusory moment that ought to regulate our choice for\r\nlife: for to choose well, we ought to compare; how then is it possible,\r\nwhen our imaginations are engrossed by a sole object; when that object\r\ncannot even be investigated, as we are plunged in intoxication and\r\nblindness? I have often, I assure you, fallen in with women attacked by\r\nthis dangerous disorder; some of them I have been in confidence with:\r\nhear them speak, their lovers were in every degree all perfection;\r\nbut those perfections were confined to their imaginations only. Their\r\nexalted ideas dress at pleasure those they prefer; they dream of\r\nnothing but excellence and virtue; it is the drapery of an angel often\r\nworn by an abject model: be him as he may, they have no sooner adorned\r\nhim, than, dupes to their own labour, they fall down and adore him.\r\n\r\nYour daughter, then, does not love Danceny, or, she is fascinated by\r\nthis same illusion; and if they mutually love, they both experience the\r\nsame. Thus your reason for uniting them is reduced to a certainty that\r\nthey do not know each other, but also, that they never can know each\r\nother. I think I hear you say, “Can M. de Gercourt and my daughter know\r\neach other better?” No, certainly; but at least they do not mistake\r\nthemselves; they are not sufficiently acquainted together. What then\r\nhappens between a couple that I suppose decent? Why they study to\r\nplease, observe, seek, and find out soon what inclinations or desires\r\nthey must relinquish, for their mutual tranquillity. Those small self\r\ndenials give but little uneasiness, as they are foreseen, and are\r\nreciprocal; they are soon converted into mutual good will; and custom,\r\nwhich ever strengthens all inclinations it does not destroy, gradually\r\nleads to that sincere friendship, that tender confidence, which, when\r\nunited with esteem, forms, I think, the true solid happiness of the\r\nmarried state.\r\n\r\nThe illusions of love, I will allow, are more engaging; but don’t we\r\nwell know they are not so lasting? And what dangers does not their\r\ndestruction bring on! Then the most trivial faults become shocking\r\nand intolerable, being contrasted with the ideas of perfection which\r\nhad seduced us. Each then thinks the other is only altered, and they\r\nthemselves of as much worth as in the first instant the error took its\r\nrise. They are astonished they can no longer create the charm they\r\nexperienced; they are humbled; vanity is hurt, the mind is soured,\r\ninjuries augmented, which bring on peevishness, and is succeeded by\r\nhatred; thus frivolous pleasures are repaid by long misfortunes.\r\n\r\nI have now given you, my dear friend, my thoughts on this subject. I\r\ndo not insist on them, only lay them before you:—you are to decide.\r\nShould you persist in your opinion, I shall only beg to know the\r\nreasons that combat mine. I shall be happy to be set right by you, and,\r\nabove all, to be made easy on the fate of that lovely child, whose\r\nhappiness I so ardently wish, not only for my particular friendship for\r\nher, but also for that which unites me to you for ever.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Oct._ 4, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CV.\r\n\r\n_The_ Marchioness de Merteuil _to_ Cecilia Volanges.\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, my dear little creature, you are very much vexed and ashamed; and\r\nthis same Valmont is a wicked man, is he not? How is all this? He dared\r\nbehave to you as he would to the woman he loved best! He has taught\r\nyou what you was going mad to know! Upon my word, such proceedings are\r\nunpardonable. And you, like a good girl, would have kept your chastity\r\nfor your lover, who would not attempt it; you cherish the torments of\r\nlove only, but not its pleasures. Why this is charming; and you will\r\nmake a conspicuous figure in a romance. Love, misfortunes, and virtue\r\nin abundance! Lord! what a deal of fine things! In the midst of this\r\nbrilliant train, it is true, one may have nothing to do, but they may\r\nrepay themselves.\r\n\r\nHow the poor little thing is to be pitied! her eyes were sunk the next\r\nmorning! What will you say, then, when your lover’s will be so? My\r\ndear angel, you will not be always so; all men are not Valmonts: and\r\nagain; not dare lift up your eyes! Oh, there you was very right; every\r\none would have read your adventure in them. Believe me, however, if it\r\nwas so, our women and our young ladies even would assume more modest\r\ncountenances.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the praises you perceive I am obliged to give you, yet\r\nyou must agree you failed in your master piece, which was to tell all\r\nto your mama. You had begun so well; you had flung yourself in her\r\narms; you sobbed and cried. What a pathetic scene! What a pity you\r\ndid not complete it! Your tender mama, overjoyed, and to assist your\r\nvirtue, would have shut you up in a convent for life; and there you\r\nmight have loved Danceny as much as you pleased, without a rival, and\r\nwithout any sin; you might be afflicted at your leisure; Valmont would\r\nnot certainly have come to trouble your affliction with his naughty\r\namusements.\r\n\r\nBut seriously, is it possible to be so childish, and turned of fifteen,\r\nas you are! You are much in the right to say, you are scarcely worthy\r\nmy care; yet I wish to be your friend: you want one with the mother you\r\nhave, and the husband she intends for you; but if you do not improve\r\nmore, what can one make of you? What can be hoped, if what gives girls\r\nsense and understanding, deprives you of them.\r\n\r\nIf you could once bring yourself to reflect for a moment, you would\r\nsoon discover, you would rather congratulate yourself than grieve:\r\nbut you are ashamed; and that hurts you. Compose yourself; the shame\r\nthat follows love is like the pain; you suffer it but once. It may be\r\nfeigned afterwards, but is never felt: and yet the pleasure remains,\r\nand you will own that is of consequence. I think I can even pick out\r\namong your nonsense, you lay some stress on it. Come, be honest; that\r\nuneasiness that prevented _you from doing as you said_; that made you\r\nfind it _so difficult to struggle_; that made you, as it were, _vexed_,\r\nwhen Valmont went away; was it shame or pleasure occasioned it? And\r\n_his manner of speaking, to which one did not know how to answer_, did\r\nit not proceed from _his manner of doing_? Ah, little girl! you tell a\r\nlie to your friend; that’s not right: but enough of that.\r\n\r\nWhat above every thing to any one else is nothing more than pleasure,\r\nin your situation is real happiness. Being so circumstanced with a\r\nmother, whose affection is of so much importance, and a lover whom you\r\nwish ever to enjoy, can you not plainly see the only means to unite\r\nsuccessfully those opposite interests is to bring in a third? Drawn off\r\nby this new adventure, whilst you will seem to your mama to sacrifice\r\nsubmissively to her will, a passion that was not agreeable to her,\r\nyou will establish with your lover the honour of having made a fine\r\nresistance. Assuring him constantly of your affections, you must not\r\ngrant him the convincing proofs. Those refusals, which are so trifling\r\nin your situation, he will not fail to attribute to virtue; he may,\r\nperhaps, repine, but his love will increase; and to enjoy the double\r\nmerit of sacrificing to the one your affection, and to the other only\r\nto resist its force, it will cost nothing more than the enjoyment of\r\nits delights. How many women have lost their reputation, who would have\r\nanxiously preserved it, had they such a field.\r\n\r\nDoes not this scheme appear the most feasible as well as the most\r\ndelightful to you? Do you know what you have got by the one you have\r\ntaken? Your mama attributed your immoderate grief to your increase of\r\nlove, and was so enraged, that she only waited to be convinced, in\r\norder to punish you. I have just received a letter from her. She will\r\nattempt every method to extract the avowal from yourself. She writes\r\nme, she may, perhaps, even go so far as to propose Danceny to you for\r\na husband, and this only to make you speak out. If, seduced by this\r\naffectation of tenderness, you should open your heart, she would shut\r\nyou up for a long time, perhaps, for ever, to deplore at leisure your\r\nblind credulity.\r\n\r\nThis scheme she intends to execute against you must be counteracted by\r\nanother. Begin, then, to be more cheerful, to make her believe you do\r\nnot think so much of Danceny. She will be the more easily prevailed on\r\nto believe it, as it is the usual effect of absence; and she will be\r\nthe more pleased with you, as she will applaud herself for her prudence\r\nwhich suggested the method. If she should still have her doubts, should\r\npersist in sounding you, and should come to mention matrimony, abide,\r\nlike a prudent girl, in your absolute submission for you risk nothing;\r\nas to a husband, one is always as good as another; the most troublesome\r\nis not more so than a mother.\r\n\r\nWhen your mama is once better pleased, she will have you married;\r\nthen, being more free in your proceedings, you can, if you please,\r\nquit Valmont to have Danceny, or even keep both; for observe, Danceny\r\nis agreeable, it is true, but he is one of those men one can have when\r\nthey please, and as often as they please; so you may be easy as to\r\nhim.—Not so with Valmont; it is dangerous to quit him, and difficult\r\nto keep him; one must be very skilful, or very tractable: if you could,\r\nhowever, attach him as a friend, you would be happy indeed. He would\r\nelevate you to the first rank among the modish women; that is the way\r\nto gain consistency in life, and not sit blushing and crying as if your\r\nnuns had made you eat your dinner on your knees.\r\n\r\nIf you are prudent, you will then endeavour to make it up with Valmont,\r\nwho must be very angry with you: as you must learn to repair your\r\nfolly, do not be afraid to make him some advances; you will soon learn,\r\nthat although the men make the first to us, we are always obliged to\r\nmake the second. You will have a pretence for it, for you must not keep\r\nthis letter; and I require you will deliver it to Valmont as soon as\r\nyou have read it. Do not forget to seal it again, however, before you\r\ngive it: for, in the first place, I want to leave the whole merit of\r\nthis proceeding to yourself, that it should not carry the appearance of\r\nan advice; moreover, I do not know any one I have so much friendship\r\nfor, as to write as I do to you.\r\n\r\nAdieu! my charming angel! follow my advice, and let me know how it\r\nsucceeds.\r\n\r\nP. S. Now I think on’t, I had like to forget—A word more—Take a\r\nlittle more care in your style of writing; you always write so like a\r\nchild; I know from whence it proceeds; you always write as you think,\r\nbut do not study what you ought to say: that may do very well between\r\nyou and me, who should not have any secrets from one another; but with\r\nevery one else, particularly with your lover, it looks so foolish. You\r\nmust observe, when you write to any one, it is for them, and not for\r\nyourself: you must endeavour, then, to write to please them, and not\r\ngive them your thoughts.\r\n\r\nAdieu! my heart! I embrace you, instead of being angry, in hopes you\r\nwill be more rational.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Oct._ 4, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CVI.\r\n\r\n_The_ Marchioness de Merteuil _to the_ Viscount de Valmont.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdmirable, my dear Viscount! now I love you to distraction; after the\r\nfirst of your two letters, I might well expect the second, which did\r\nnot much surprise me; although you were so proud of your future success\r\nas to solicit the reward, and ask me if I was ready, I foresaw there\r\nwas no necessity for all that expedition. Yes, upon honour, perusing\r\nthe recital of your tender scene, that had _affected you so much_; and\r\nreflecting on your modesty, worthy the most glorious days of chivalry,\r\nI exclaimed, “The opportunity is lost!” How could it be otherwise?\r\nWhat would you have a poor woman do, who surrenders, and will not be\r\naccepted? Why, faith, in such a circumstance, appearances must be\r\nsaved, and that is only what your Presidente has done. For my part, I\r\nvery well know, the step she has taken has its effect, and intend to\r\nfollow the example on the first serious occasion that offers; but I\r\nswear, if whoever I take this trouble for does not make a better use of\r\nit than you have done, he may certainly renounce me for ever.\r\n\r\nThus are you reduced, positively, to a mere nothing! by two women, one\r\nof which was fixed for the next day, and the other wished for nothing\r\nso much! Well, you will be apt to think I boast, and say it is easy to\r\nprophecy after the event; but I swear I expected it; for you really\r\nhave no genius for your profession; you barely know what you have\r\nlearned; you have no invention; when circumstances do not assist your\r\nformalities of custom, and you are obliged to go out of the common\r\nroad, you stop short like a school-boy; to sum up all, a childishness\r\non the one hand, a return of prudery on the other, because they are not\r\nevery day experienced, are enough to disconcert you; you neither know\r\nhow to remedy or prevent them. Ah, Viscount! Viscount! you teach me not\r\nto judge men by their success, and we must soon say of you, “he was\r\nbrave such a day.” When you commit blunder on blunder, why then you fly\r\nto me—One would imagine I have nothing else to do but retrieve your\r\nfollies: it is certainly work enough for any one person.\r\n\r\nHowever, as to those two adventures; the one was undertaken contrary\r\nto my inclination;—the other, as you have paid some attention to my\r\nwishes, I take on myself.\r\n\r\nRead first the enclosed letter, then give it to the little Volanges;\r\nit is more than sufficient to recall her; but I beg you will pay some\r\nattention to this child; let us join together to make her the greatest\r\ncurse and affliction of her mother and Gercourt: there is no danger\r\nin giving her large doses; I see plainly the little thing will not be\r\nfrightened; and, our scheme once completed, she may act as she pleases.\r\n\r\nI shall be totally unconcerned about her. I had some thoughts of\r\nmaking her a subaltern intriguer, to take her to play the second parts\r\nunder me; but I perceive she has no genius; she has a kind of foolish\r\nopenness that has not given way to the specific you administered,\r\nwhich, however, seldom fails; and, in my opinion, it is the most\r\ndangerous disorder a woman can possibly have; it marks, more than any\r\nthing, a weakness of temper, which opposes every thing, and which is\r\nalmost always incurable; so that our time would be lost in forming\r\nthis little girl for intrigue, as, at best, she never will be more\r\nthan a comeatable woman. I don’t know any thing so insipid, as that\r\nstupid facility, that makes a woman compliant without knowing why or\r\nwherefore; only because she is attacked, and knows not how to resist;\r\nthose sort of women are absolutely mere machines. You will say, that\r\nis all we want; and that is sufficient for our purpose. Be it so: but\r\nit must not be forgot, that every one soon becomes acquainted with the\r\nsprings and contrivers of those machines; so that to use this one,\r\nwithout bad consequences, we must lose no time, stop when necessary,\r\nand afterwards break it. We shall not be at a loss to get rid of her,\r\nand Gercourt will be ready to cloister her when we please. When he can\r\nno longer doubt his disaster, when it will be public and notorious,\r\nwhat matters it us if he revenges himself, provided he is inconsolable?\r\nWhat I say of the husband, I dare say you think the same of the mother;\r\ntherefore look it as done.\r\n\r\nThis measure, which I conceive to be the best, attracted my thoughts,\r\nmade me resolve to lead on the young thing briskly, as you will\r\nperceive by my letter; it is also of the utmost consequence not to\r\nleave any thing in her possession that may commit us, which I beg\r\nyou will attend to. This precaution observed, I take the morality on\r\nmyself; the remainder is in your department; however, if we should\r\nhereafter find she improves, we shall always have time to alter our\r\nplan; which had like to have been the case, and that we should one\r\ntime or other have been employed at what we are now about; but at all\r\nevents our labour will not be lost.\r\n\r\nI must, however, tell you, mine had like to be destroyed; and\r\nGercourt’s good fortune had nearly overpowered my prudence. Madame de\r\nVolanges, in a fit of maternal fondness, was on the point of giving\r\naway her daughter to Danceny; from thence proceeded the remarkable\r\ntenderness you observed the _next morning_. This would have been still\r\none of your master strokes. Fortunately the tender parent consulted me\r\nabout it; and I expect my answer will give her a disrelish to it. I\r\nsaid so much in praise of virtue, and wheedled her so well, that I am\r\nsure she will be pleased with my reasons.\r\n\r\nI am sorry I had not time to take a copy of my letter, for your\r\nedification, on the austerity of my morals. You would there see how\r\ncontemptible I hold those women of depraved principles who have\r\nlovers. Nothing so commodious, as to be a rigourist in convention; it\r\nonly hurts others, and gives us no uneasiness. Moreover, I am informed\r\nthe good lady has had her little foibles, as well as others, in her\r\nyounger days. I was not sorry to humble her conscience, at least, which\r\nwas some consolation for the praises I was obliged to give her against\r\nmy own. It was thus, in the same letter, the idea of hurting Gercourt\r\ninspired me the resolution to speak well of him.\r\n\r\nAdieu, Viscount! I approve much of your plan of remaining where you\r\nare for some time. I have no means for expediting your march: but I\r\nrecommend you should employ your time with our pupil. As to myself,\r\nnotwithstanding your polite summons, you find you must still wait, and\r\nyou will agree with me it is not my fault.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Oct._ 4, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CVII.\r\n\r\nAzolan _to the_ Viscount de Valmont.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nOn receipt of your orders, I immediately waited on Mr. Bertrand, your\r\nhonour’s steward, who paid me twenty-five louis d’ors, as your honour\r\nhad ordered. I asked him for two more for Philip, who was to set off\r\nimmediately, as your honour had ordered, and who had no money; but your\r\nsteward would not give them, as he said he had not any order from your\r\nhonour to that purpose; so I was obliged to give them to myself, and\r\nwhich your honour will be pleased to observe.\r\n\r\nPhilip set out last night. I recommended it to him strongly not to\r\nleave the inn, that you may find him when necessary.\r\n\r\nI went immediately after to Madame the Presidente’s, to see\r\nMademoiselle Julie: but she was abroad, and I could only speak to La\r\nFleure, from whom I could not get any intelligence, because he has\r\nbeen always abroad since his return only at meal times. It is the\r\nsecond that has always attended table, and your honour knows I had no\r\nacquaintance with him: but I began to-day.\r\n\r\nI returned this morning to Mademoiselle Julie, and she seemed very glad\r\nto see me. I asked her concerning the reason of her mistress returning\r\nto town; she told me, she knew nothing of it, and I believe she spoke\r\ntruth. I scolded her, because she did not tell me of their going away,\r\nand she declared she knew nothing of it till her mistress was going to\r\nbed; so she was obliged to sit up to settle every thing, and the poor\r\ngirl had but two hours rest. She did not leave her mistress till past\r\none; and she left her writing.\r\n\r\nIn the morning Madame de Tourvel left a letter with the housekeeper.\r\nMademoiselle Julie does not know for who: but imagined it was for your\r\nhonour, but your honour said nothing of it to me. During the whole\r\njourney Madame had a great cloak over her, which hid her entirely; but\r\nMademoiselle Julie thinks she cried very often. She did not speak a\r\nword during the whole journey, and she would not stop at ——,[1] as\r\nshe did in coming; which was not very agreeable to Mademoiselle Julie,\r\nwho had not breakfasted: but, as I said, masters will be masters.\r\n\r\nWhen they came to town, Madame went to bed for two hours. When she got\r\nup, she sent for the porter, and gave him orders not to admit any one.\r\nShe did not make any toilette. She sat down to dinner, but only tasted\r\na little soup, and went away directly. Her coffee was brought to her\r\napartment. Mademoiselle Julie went in at the same time. She found her\r\nmistress settling some papers in her desk, and she could perceive they\r\nwere letters. I would lay a wager they were your honour’s; and of the\r\nthree she received the same evening, there was one she had before her\r\nlate the same night. I am very certain it was one from your honour: but\r\nwhy should she come away that way, that astonishes me; but certainly\r\nyour honour knows, and it is no business of mine.\r\n\r\nMadame the Presidente went to the library in the evening, and took two\r\nbooks, which she carried into her dressing room: but Mademoiselle Julie\r\ndeclares she did not read a quarter of an hour the whole day, and\r\nthat she did nothing but read the letter, muse, and lean on her arm.\r\nAs I thought your honour would be glad to know what books they were,\r\nand that Mademoiselle Julie did not know, I made an excuse to go and\r\nsee the library to-day: there is no void but for two books; one is the\r\nsecond volume of Christian Thoughts, and the other the first book of a\r\nwork entitled Clarissa. I write as it was before me; your honour will\r\ncertainly know what it is.\r\n\r\nLast night Madame had no supper, only took tea. This morning she rung\r\nearly, and ordered her carriage immediately, and went before nine\r\nto mass at the Fenillant’s. She wanted to go to confession, but her\r\nconfessor was not in the way, and will not return for eight or ten\r\ndays. I thought it necessary to inform your honour of this. She then\r\ncame home, breakfasted, and sat down to write, and stayed at it till\r\nnear one o’clock. I then found an opportunity of doing what your\r\nhonour wished most for, for I carried the letters to the post office.\r\nThere was none for Madame de Volanges; but I send your honour one for\r\nMonsieur the President; I thought that might be the most necessary.\r\nThere was one also for Madame de Rosemonde; but I thought your honour\r\nmight see that whenever you had a mind, and I let it go. Besides,\r\nyour honour will know all, as Madame the Presidente has wrote to him.\r\nHereafter I can have all your honour pleases; for it is Mademoiselle\r\nJulie that almost always gives them to the servants, and she has\r\npromised me, that out of friendship to me as well as for your honour,\r\nshe will do every thing I would have her. She would not even take the\r\nmoney I offered her; but I dare say your honour will make her some\r\nsmall present; and if it is your pleasure, and that you think proper, I\r\nshall soon know what will please her.\r\n\r\nI hope your honour will not think me negligent in your service. I have\r\nit much at heart to be clear of the reproaches made me. It was my zeal\r\nfor your honour’s service was the reason of my not knowing Madame the\r\nPresidente’s departure, because your honour ordered me to set out at\r\nthree in the morning, which hindered me from seeing Mademoiselle Julie\r\nat night as usual, as I went to sleep with the ostler, that I might not\r\ndisturb the people in the castle.\r\n\r\nAs to what your honour says, I am often in want of money, it is because\r\nI always love to be decent, as your honour may see; besides, one must\r\nkeep up the honour of the livery they wear. I know very well I ought to\r\nsave something for a rainy day; but I depend entirely on your honour’s\r\ngenerosity, who has been so good a master.\r\n\r\nAs to what your honour desires, of my entering into Madame de Tourvel’s\r\nservice, and still remaining in yours, I hope your honour will not\r\nrequire it; it was quite different at the Duchess’s, for I certainly\r\ncannot stoop to wear a livery, and a lawyer’s livery, after having been\r\nyour honour’s huntsman. As for all the rest, your honour may dispose as\r\nyou please of him, who is, with the greatest respect and affection, his\r\nmost humble and obedient servant,\r\n\r\nRoux Azolan, _huntsman._\r\n\r\n_Paris, Oct._ 5, _at night._\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The same village, half way on the roads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CVIII.\r\n\r\n_The_ Presidente de Tourvel _to_ Madame de Rosemonde.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear indulgent mother, what obligations do I not lay under to you!\r\nwhat comfort have I not received from your letter! I have read it over\r\nand over; I cannot lay it down; to it I owe the few moments of ease I\r\nhave had since my departure. Your bounty, your virtue, your prudence\r\ncan, then, compassionate my weakness. You pity my misfortunes. Ah!\r\ncould you but be sensible of them—they are frightful. I imagined I had\r\nexperienced the pangs of love; but the most excruciating, which must\r\nbe felt to have any idea of it, is to be separated from the beloved\r\nobject, for ever separated!—The anguish that sinks me to-day will\r\nagain return to-morrow, the next day, all my life! Great God! I am yet\r\nbut young, what a length of sufferings!\r\n\r\nTo be the cause of one’s own misery; to tear one’s heart with their own\r\nhands; and during those insupportable torments, to know one can put a\r\nperiod to them with a word, and that word to be criminal!—Alas, my\r\ndear friend!—\r\n\r\nWhen I took the painful resolution to banish myself from him, I was\r\nflattered with the hope that absence would increase my strength and\r\nresolution. How fatally am I deceived! They seem to have totally\r\nabandoned me. I had more to struggle with, it’s true: but in my\r\nresistance I was not deprived of all resource; I could sometimes\r\nsee him; often even not daring to look on him, I was sensible his\r\neyes were fixed on me, they seemed to cheer my heart. But now in my\r\ndismal solitude, separated from all my heart held dear, lonely with my\r\nmisfortunes, every moment of my painful existence is marked with tears,\r\nnothing to soften their bitterness, no consolation to mingle with my\r\nsacrifices; and those I have already made, render those I still must\r\nmake more sorrowful.\r\n\r\nEven yesterday, how forcibly did I experience this! Among the\r\nletters brought me, there was one from him, which I distinguished\r\nfrom among the rest before they were delivered. I trembled—I rose\r\ninvoluntarily—scarce could conceal my emotion; and yet that state was\r\nnot unpleasing. Soon after left alone, this deceitful pleasure fled,\r\nand left one more sacrifice to be made: for how could I open this\r\nletter, which I was impatient to read? Strange fatality! that the few\r\nconsolations which offer are so many new privations to me; which are\r\nstill made more intolerable by the idea that M. de Valmont shares them.\r\n\r\nIt is out at last; that name that incessantly possesses me, that I had\r\nso much pain to write: the kind of reproach you gave me, has been truly\r\nalarming—I beseech you will be persuaded, no false shame has altered\r\nmy confidence in you;—then why should I be afraid to name him? Ah! I\r\nam ashamed of my sentiments, but not of him who causes them. Where is\r\nthere another so worthy to inspire them? Yet I can’t account why that\r\nname does not naturally flow from my pen; and even now, I could not\r\nwrite it without some pause: but to return to him. You write me, he\r\nappeared _amazingly affected at my departure_. What did he say then?\r\nWhat did he do? Did he talk of returning to Paris? I beg you will put\r\nhim off it, if you possibly can. If he does me justice, he ought not\r\nto be angry with me for this step: but he must be sensible it is an\r\nirreversible resolution. One of my greatest tortures is to be ignorant\r\nof his thoughts. I still have his letter there—but you will certainly\r\nagree with me, I ought not to open it.\r\n\r\nIt is only through you, my most indulgent friend, I shall not be\r\nentirely separated from him. I will not abuse your goodness. I know\r\nwell you must not write long letters: but you will not refuse a few\r\nwords to your child, to assist her resolution, and console her. Adieu,\r\nmy most respectable friend!\r\n\r\n_Paris, Oct._ 5, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CIX.\r\n\r\nCecilia Volanges _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Madam, I did not deliver the letter you did me the honour to write\r\nme until this day to M. de Valmont. I kept it four days, often under\r\ngreat apprehensions lest it should be discovered; but concealed it\r\ncarefully; and when a fit of dulness seized me, I locked myself up to\r\nread it again. I begin to think what I imagined so great a misfortune,\r\nis a trifling thing; I own there is a deal of pleasure in it; so that\r\nI begin to be tolerably easy. Nothing now gives me any trouble, but\r\nthe idea of Danceny; I am often, that I do not think of him at all,\r\nand I believe it is because M. de Valmont is so engaging. I made it\r\nup with him two days ago; which was not at all difficult; for before I\r\nhad scarcely spoke, he said, if I had any thing to tell him, he would\r\ncome to my room at night if it was agreeable to me. As soon as he came,\r\nhe was as good humoured as if I had not done any thing to vex him. He\r\ndid not scold me till afterwards, and then very gently, but in such a\r\nmanner—just as you used to do; which convinces me, he loves me very\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nI cannot remember all the comical stories he told me, which I should\r\nnever have believed, particularly about mama. I would be much obliged\r\nto you, if you would let me know if it is all true. I could not refrain\r\nfrom laughing; once I was ready to burst out, which frightened us both;\r\nfor mama would have heard me, and then what would become of me! she\r\nwould have infallibly shut me up in the convent.\r\n\r\nI must be prudent; and, as M. de Valmont says he would not run the risk\r\nof a discovery for all the world, we have agreed, hereafter he will\r\nonly come, open the door, and we will go to his chamber. There will be\r\nno danger then; I was there last night: whilst I am writing to you, I\r\nexpect him. Now, Madam, I hope you will not be angry with me. There is\r\nstill something in your letter that surprises me a good deal; that is,\r\nin regard to Danceny and M. de Valmont when I am married. I think you\r\ntold me at the opera, when once I was married, I should love no one but\r\nmy husband, and I must even forget Danceny: may be I did not understand\r\nyou right; and I would much rather it was otherwise, because I should\r\nnot then be so much afraid of being married. I shall even wish for\r\nit, as I shall have the more liberty. I hope then matters may be so\r\nsettled, that I shall have Danceny only to think of. I know very well\r\nI shall never be truly happy but with him; for the thoughts of him\r\nconstantly disturb me; I have no peace but when I do not think of him,\r\nand that is not in my power; as soon as he comes in my head, I grow\r\nmelancholy.\r\n\r\nMy greatest consolation is, you promise me Danceny will love me the\r\nmore for it: are you very sure of it? You would not deceive me, I know;\r\nhowever, it is very whimsical that it should be Danceny I love, and\r\nthat M. de Valmont—but, as you say, may be it is all for the better. I\r\ndo not well understand what you mention about my writing. Danceny likes\r\nmy letters very well: I must not say any thing to him, I know, about\r\nwhat passes between M. de Valmont and me—you need not be uneasy about\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nMama has not spoke yet about marriage; but when she does, since it is\r\nto ensnare me, I promise you I will know how to tell a lie.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear friend; I am very much obliged to you; I assure you I\r\nshall never forget your friendship: I must conclude, for it is almost\r\none, and M. de Valmont will be here soon.\r\n\r\n_Oct._ 10, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CX.\r\n\r\nViscount de Valmont _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ye heavenly powers! I have a soul formed for sorrow; grant me one for\r\nbliss._[1]. I think it is the tender Saint Preux, who thus expresses\r\nhimself: more equally divided than he, I at once am possessed of both.\r\nI am, my dear friend, at once very happy and very miserable; since you\r\nare entirely in my confidence, I will relate my pains and pleasures.\r\n\r\nMy ungrateful devotee still perseveres in her inflexibility; she has\r\nreturned me four letters unopened—not four neither, for guessing\r\nthat after the first, it would be followed by another, I resolved not\r\nto lose my time thus, to make my mournful complaints as common-place\r\nwithout a date, and since the second post, it is always the same letter\r\ngoes and comes, I only change the cover. If my fair one ends as fair\r\nones generally do, and will relent, at least through fatigue; she will\r\nat length keep it: then will be the time to renew the correspondence;\r\nyou may guess this new method hurts my intelligence.—I have, however\r\ndiscovered the fickle woman has changed her confidant; I am certain\r\nat least since her leaving the castle, she has not wrote to Madame de\r\nVolanges; but has twice wrote to old Rosemonde. As she has not said any\r\nthing of it to us, and does not even mention her _dear fair one_, who\r\nshe was incessantly talking of, I concluded she is appointed successor:\r\nI conjecture the necessity of talking of me on the one hand, and the\r\nshame of again assuming with Madame de Volanges, a subject so long\r\ndisavowed, have produced this grand revolution: I am apprehensive I\r\nshall lose by the change; for the older women grow, the more morose and\r\nsevere they are: the first would have said every thing evil of me, but\r\nthe other will say more of the evils of love; and the sensible prude\r\nis more afraid of the passion than the Person. The only method to be\r\ninformed is, as you will observe, to put a stop to the clandestine\r\ntrade; I have already given my huntsman ample directions, and am hourly\r\nin expectation; until then, chance rules all. For these last eight\r\ndays I have run over all manner of known methods, as also those of\r\nromances and secret memoirs, and cannot find a precedent neither for\r\nthe circumstances of the adventure, or character of the heroine. The\r\ndifficulty does not lie in getting into her house, even at night, or\r\neven to set her asleep as in Clarissa, but after two months of care\r\nand trouble, to be obliged to recur to such strange methods; follow\r\nthe track others have left, and triumph without glory!—No, she shall\r\nnot have _the pleasure of vice and the honour of virtue._[2] It is not\r\nenough to possess her, she shall give herself up: to compass this, I\r\nmust not only get in to her house, with her consent; find her alone,\r\nand inclined to listen to me; above all, blind her on her danger, for\r\nif she perceives it, she will overcome it or perish. The more convinced\r\nI am what is necessary to be done, the greater I find the difficulties\r\nin the execution; were you again to ridicule me, I will confess my\r\nembarrassment increases the more I think of it.\r\n\r\nI really believe I should have gone mad, were it not for the pleasing\r\ndistraction our pupil gives me; my recreations with her are an antidote\r\nto melancholy.\r\n\r\nWould you believe it was three whole days before your letter had any\r\neffect on the little terrified creature? Thus one false idea is capable\r\nof destroying the best disposition.\r\n\r\nAt length on Saturday she came about, began to mutter a few words,\r\nin such a low tone, and so inarticulate, with shame no doubt, it was\r\nalmost impossible to understand her: her blushes, however, declared the\r\nbusiness; until then, I assumed a consequential air, but soon softened\r\nby so pleasing a repentance, I condescended to promise the pretty\r\npenitent, to go to her at night; this favour was accepted with all the\r\ngratitude due to so great a kindness.\r\n\r\nAs I never lose sight of your schemes or my own, I resolved not to\r\nneglect this opportunity of coming at the intrinsic value of this\r\nchild, also to accelerate her education. To be more at liberty to\r\nprosecute this business, it was necessary to change the place of\r\nrendezvous, for as there is only a closet which separates her room from\r\nthat of her mother’s, she could not think herself sufficiently safe to\r\nindulge at her ease: I was determined then to contrive _innocently_,\r\nsome noise which should frighten her, and make her resolve in future to\r\naccept a place of more safety, but she saved me the trouble.\r\n\r\nThe little thing laughs much, and to keep up her spirits, I took it\r\nin my head between the acts, to tell her some scandalous adventures\r\nthat occurred to me; to give them a greater relish, and fix her\r\nattention the more, I put them all to her mother’s account, who I\r\nloaded with vice and folly. My design in this, was to encourage my\r\ntimid scholar, and inspire her with a most despicable opinion of her\r\nmother. I have always observed, that if this method was not always\r\nnecessary for the seduction of a young girl, it is indispensable, even\r\nthe most efficacious, to vitiate her; for she who has no respect for\r\nher mother, will never have any for herself: this moral truth, which I\r\nthink so useful, I am glad to illustrate by an example to corroborate\r\nthe precept. But your pupil, who did not dream of the moral, was every\r\nmoment ready to burst with laughing, and once had like to have broke\r\nout. I had no difficulty to persuade her she made a great noise; I\r\nseemed much alarmed, so did she: that it might make the impression\r\nmore forcible, I did not suffer pleasure to make its appearance again,\r\nbut left her three hours sooner than usual, after having agreed to\r\nmeet the next night in my chamber. I have already received her twice:\r\nin this short interval, the scholar is almost as learned as the\r\nmaster: yes, upon my word I have taught her every thing as far as the\r\ncompliances: I have concealed nothing but the precautions.\r\n\r\nBeing thus engaged all night, I sleep the greatest part of the day;\r\nand as, in the present state of the castle, I have nothing to attract\r\nme, I scarcely appear an hour in the day in the saloon. To-day I have\r\ntaken the resolution to eat in my room—shall only leave it now and\r\nthen for a short walk: those oddities will be imputed to my health;\r\nI have declared I was _devoured with spleen_; I have also talked of\r\na little fever; it will be sufficient to speak in a weak and languid\r\nvoice to make that go down; and for an alteration in my countenance,\r\nrely on your pupil, _love will provide for it_.[3] My leisure hours\r\nare taken up with the means of regaining the advantages I have lost\r\nover my ingrate, in competing a catechism of debauchery for the use\r\nof my scholar, wherein I call every thing by its technical name; I\r\nanticipate my joy on the very affecting conversation it will furnish\r\nbetween Gercourt and she the first night after their marriage. Nothing\r\ncan be more diverting than the ingenuousness with which she expresses\r\nwhat little she knows of this language; she does not think people ought\r\nto speak otherwise; this is really enchanting; this contrast of simple\r\ncandour, with the style of barefaced impudence, has its effect; and I\r\ndo not know how it is, but of late nothing pleases me but oddities.\r\n\r\nI give too much way perhaps to this, as I commit my time and health;\r\nbut I hope my feigned sickness may, besides saving me the disagreeable\r\ntediousness of the saloon, be of service with my austere devotee, whole\r\nferocious virtue is still allied to tender sensibility! I make no doubt\r\nshe is by this time informed of this great event, and I have a strong\r\ndesire to know how she takes it, as I would venture to lay a wager she\r\nwill take the honour of it to herself; I shall regulate the state of my\r\nhealth according to the impression it makes on her. Now, my charming\r\nfriend, you have my whole story: I wish to have more interesting news\r\nfor you; and I hope you will be persuaded, that I reckon on the reward\r\nI expect from you as a great share in the pleasure I promise myself.\r\n\r\n_Oct._ 11, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] New Heloise.\r\n\r\n[2] New Heloise.\r\n\r\n[3] Regnard’s Amorous Follies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXI.\r\n\r\nCount Gercourt _to_ Madame de Volanges.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery thing in this country, Madam, has the most pacific appearance,\r\nand we daily expect orders to return to France. I hope you have not\r\nthe least doubt of my eagerness for this return, to complete my union\r\nwith Mademoiselle de Volanges and you. Yet the Duke of ——, my cousin,\r\nto whom you know I am under so many obligations, has just informed\r\nme of his recall from Naples. He writes me, his intention to come\r\nby Rome, and take in his way that part of Italy he has not seen. He\r\nrequests I should accompany him on this journey, which will be of six\r\nweeks or two months. I will not conceal from you, it would be very\r\nagreeable to me to embrace this opportunity. For when once married,\r\nI shall not readily undertake any journeys but those the service will\r\nrequire; perhaps, it would be also more convenient to postpone the\r\nceremony until winter, as all my relations will not be in Paris until\r\nthen, particularly the Marquis de ——, to whom I am indebted for the\r\nhope of being allied to you. Notwithstanding those considerations, my\r\nresolutions on this matter shall be entirely governed by yours; and\r\nif you are not perfectly satisfied with this proposal, I instantly\r\nrenounce mine. I only request you will do me the favour to inform me of\r\nyour intentions. I shall wait your answer here, which will regulate my\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nI am, with great respect, and every sentiment due from a son,\r\n\r\nyour most humble servant,\r\n\r\n_Count de_ Gercourt.\r\n\r\n_Bastia, Oct._ 10, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXII.\r\n\r\nMadame de Rosemonde _to the_ Presidente de Tourvel.\r\n\r\n(_Dictated only._)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis instant, my lovely dear, I received your letter of the 11th,[1]\r\nand the mild reproaches it contains. You must confess you intended to\r\nmake many more; if you had not recollected my title of mother, you\r\nwould have given me a scolding. That would have been very unjust. It\r\nwas my hope and wish, to have been able to answer you myself, which\r\nmade me defer it daily; yet, after all, you see I am obliged to\r\nemploy my waiting woman’s hand, to do me that office. The abominable\r\nrheumatism has again seized me; it has this time taken its residence\r\nin my right arm, so I am absolutely deprived of its use. This is the\r\nconsequence of such a young blooming creature’s having old friends;\r\nthey suffer from our disorders.\r\n\r\nAs soon as my pains will give me any relief, assure yourself I will\r\nhave a long chat with you. In the mean time I must acquaint you,\r\nI received both your letters. If it was possible, they would have\r\nredoubled my friendship for you; and that I shall never cease taking a\r\nlively share in every thing that concerns you.\r\n\r\nMy nephew is also a little indisposed; but it is not of any\r\nconsequence, and need not give any uneasiness. It is a slight\r\nindisposition, which seems to affect his temper more than his health.\r\nWe scarcely ever see him now.\r\n\r\nHis retreat, and your departure, will not much enliven our little\r\ncircle. The little Volanges has an immense deal of chat, and yawns all\r\nday, as if she would swallow you; for these few days especially, she\r\ndoes us the honour to fall into a profound sleep every evening.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my lovely dear! I am ever your sincere friend, your mama, your\r\nsister even, if my great age would allow me the title. I am, in few\r\nwords, most tenderly attached to you.\r\n\r\nSigned, Adelaide, _for Madame de_ Rosemonde.\r\n\r\n_ From the castle of ——, Oct._ 14, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] This letter was never found.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXIII.\r\n\r\nMarchioness de Merteuil _to the_ Viscount de Valmont.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think it time to inform you, Viscount, the world begin to talk of\r\nyou. Your absence from Paris is remarked, and the cause guessed. I was\r\nyesterday at a public supper, which was very numerous; where it was\r\npositively asserted, you was detained in a village by an unfortunate\r\nromantic amour. Joy was instantly visible on the countenance of\r\nall those envious of your successes, and of all the women you have\r\nneglected. Believe me, you should not suffer such dangerous reports\r\nto gain ground, and should immediately return to destroy them by your\r\npresence.\r\n\r\nRemember, if you once lose the reputation of irresistible, you will\r\nsoon more readily find resistance; your rivals will lose the respect\r\nthey had for you, and will dare you; for is there one amongst them\r\nwho does not think himself more powerful than virtue? But, above all,\r\nremember, among the number of women you have held up to public view,\r\nall those you have not had, will attempt to undeceive the public,\r\nwhilst the others will use every means to abuse it. To sum up all, you\r\nmust expect to be rated, perhaps, as much beneath your value, as you\r\nhave hitherto been above it.\r\n\r\nReturn then, Viscount, and no longer sacrifice your reputation to a\r\npuerile whim. You have done all we wanted with the little Volanges;\r\nand as for your Presidente, it is not very probable you will do your\r\nbusiness with her at ten leagues distance. Do you imagine she will go\r\nafter you? Perhaps she no longer thinks of you, or thinks of you only\r\nto felicitate herself for having humbled you. But here you would find\r\nsome opportunity of appearing with eclat, and you really want it. If\r\neven you should continue obstinate in your ridiculous adventure, I\r\ncan’t see how your return would hurt you—on the contrary.\r\n\r\nFor if your Presidente _adores you,_ as you have so often told me, but\r\nnever yet proved, her only consolation, her sole pleasure, ought now to\r\nbe to speak of you, to know what you do, what you say, what you think,\r\neven the most trifling matter about you. Those wretched fooleries are\r\nof some consequence, according to the privations that are experienced.\r\nThey are the crumbs falling from the table of the rich man, which he\r\ndespises; but which the poor one collects with avidity, and feeds on.\r\nSo the poor Presidente at present receives those crumbs; and the more\r\nshe has of them, she will be less greedy for the rest. Moreover, as\r\nyou know her confidant, there is no doubt but every letter contains\r\na little exhortation to corroborate her prudence, and strengthen her\r\nvirtue. Why will you then leave resources to the one for her defence,\r\nand power to the other to hurt you.\r\n\r\nNot that I am in the least of your opinion on the loss you think you\r\nsustain by the change of confidant; for Madame de Volanges detests you,\r\nand hatred is always more ingenious and clear sighted than friendship.\r\nYour old aunt’s virtue will never permit her to slander her dear\r\nnephew, for virtue has its foibles. Again, your fears lead you into\r\nan error. It is not true, that _the older women grow, the more morose\r\nand severe they are_. It is from forty to fifty that grief for faded\r\nbeauties rage, to be forced to abandon pretensions and pleasures to\r\nwhich the mind is still attached, make almost all women peevish and\r\nridiculous. It is necessary they should have this long interval to\r\nprepare for this great sacrifice: but when it is once completed, they\r\ndivide into two classes.\r\n\r\nThe most numerous, which are those who never possessed any thing but\r\nyouth and beauty, fall into a weak apathy, from which they never\r\nrecover but for play and a few practical devotions; that class\r\nis always tiresome, often morose, sometimes marplots, but rarely\r\nmischievous. It is not easy to determine whether those women are or\r\nare not severe; without ideas, or in a manner without existence, they\r\nrepeat indifferently, and without comprehending, every thing they hear;\r\nand are, as to themselves, _non entities._\r\n\r\nThe other class, much more uncommon, but truly valuable, are those\r\nof good disposition, who having cultivated their minds, can create\r\nthemselves an existence, when nature fails; and can, when the\r\nembellishments of the outward figure are useless, place them to their\r\nminds. Those women have most commonly a sound judgment, and a mind\r\nreplete with solidity, good humour, and kindness.—They replace the\r\nseducing charms with attractive goodness and cheerfulness, whose charms\r\nincrease with their years. Thus they may be said in some shape to renew\r\ntheir age, by gaining the affections of the youthful part of society.\r\nBut far from being what you call _morose and severe_; the habits of\r\nindulgence, the long reflections on human nature, but especially the\r\nremembrance of youth, by which alone they have a relish for life, would\r\nrather make them too condescending.\r\n\r\nI can aver, having always cultivated an intimacy with old women, of\r\nwhose good opinion I saw early the advantage, I have known several who\r\nI frequented as much from inclination as interest. I shall stop here;\r\nfor I dread you should fall in love with your old aunt, you are so apt\r\nto be inflamed suddenly and morally, and bury yourself with her in the\r\ntomb you have so long dwelt in.\r\n\r\nBut to return. Although you seem enraptured with your little scholar,\r\nI fancy she has no share in your projects. You found her ready to your\r\nhand, and took her: be it so. But that cannot be called taste. It is\r\nnot even, properly speaking, an enjoyment; you possess her person\r\nonly. Not to mention her heart, which I suppose does not give you the\r\nleast uneasiness, you don’t even engage her imagination. I cannot\r\ntell whether you have observed it, but I have a proof of it in the\r\nlast letter she wrote me: I send it you, that you may be convinced.\r\nObserve, always when she mentions you, it is _M. de Valmont_; all her\r\nideas, even those you raise, terminate in Danceny; she does not call\r\nhim Monsieur, but plain Danceny. Thus she distinguishes him from all\r\nothers: and even giving herself up to you, she familiarises herself\r\nonly with him. If such a conquest has any thing _bewitching_, if the\r\npleasures you receive are so _attaching_, you are certainly modest, and\r\nnot difficult to please. Keep her; I agree to it; it is even a part\r\nof my scheme: but I really think it should not discompose you in the\r\nleast. You should also have some ascendant over her, and not suffer her\r\nto draw near Danceny, until he is a little worn out of her memory.\r\n\r\nBefore I think of your coming to me, I must tell you this pretended\r\nsickness is an exploded common trick. On my word, Viscount, you lack\r\ninvention! I am also guilty of repetitions sometimes, as you shall\r\nhear: but I endeavour to amuse by the circumstances; and success\r\njustifies me. I am going to attempt another adventure. I will agree, it\r\nhas not the merit of difficulty; but it will be a distraction at least,\r\nfor time lies very heavy on my hands.\r\n\r\nI cannot account for the reason, but since Prevan’s affair, Belleroche\r\nis become insupportable to me. He has redoubled his attention,\r\ntenderness, and _veneration_, to so violent a degree, I can hold out no\r\nlonger. His wrath at the time was pleasant enough; but it was necessary\r\nto check it, otherwise I must have committed myself; there was no\r\nmaking him listen to reason. I resolved to show him more affection,\r\nto bring him round more easily; he has taken it so seriously, that\r\never since he puts me out of all patience with his eternal charms. I\r\nmoreover take notice of his insulting confidence, for he really looks\r\non me as his property. I am really humbled. He holds me cheap, indeed,\r\nif he thinks himself capable of fixing me. He had the assurance to tell\r\nme lately, I never should have loved any other but him. Then, indeed, I\r\nlost all patience, and was obliged to call my prudence in aid, not to\r\nundeceive him instantly, by telling how matters stood. He is certainly\r\na pretty fellow, to aspire to an exclusive right! I will allow, he is\r\nwell made, and a tolerable person: but take him all in all, he is only\r\na manœuverer in love. The time is come, we must part.\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured at it this fortnight past. I have, by turns, treated\r\nhim with coolness, capriciousness, bad humour, quarrelled even; all in\r\nvain: the tenacious creature will not quit his hold. I must, then, use\r\nsome violence; for this purpose I take him with me to the country. We\r\nset out the day after to-morrow. We shall only have some people of no\r\nconsequence, and not very discerning, and shall be almost as much at\r\nliberty as if we were alone. There I shall so overload him with love\r\nand fondness, we shall so live for each other only, that he will wish\r\nto see the end of this journey, which is now his greatest bliss, more\r\nthan I shall; and if he does not return more tired of me than I shall\r\nbe of him, I consent you may say, you know more of the matter than I do.\r\n\r\nThe pretence for this retreat is, I want seriously to employ my time in\r\npreparing for my great law suit, that is to be decided the beginning\r\nof winter, which pleases me much; for it is really very disagreeable\r\nto have one’s fortune in suspense. Not that I am uneasy about the\r\nissue; for, first, I have right on my side, as all my lawyers assure\r\nme;—if it even was not the case, I should be very unskilful, indeed,\r\nif I could not gain a suit against minors of tender years, and their\r\nold guardian: however, as nothing must be omitted in a business of\r\nsuch consequence, I shall have two lawyers with me. Will not this be a\r\nsprightly jaunt? If I gain my cause, and lose Belleroche, I shall not\r\nregret the time.\r\n\r\nNow, Viscount, I will give you a hundred guesses before you name his\r\nsuccessor; I forget though, you never guess any thing—Why, Danceny.\r\nYou are astonished; for I am not yet reduced to the education of\r\nchildren. This one, however, deserves an exception in his favour. He\r\nhas the graces of youth, but not its frivolousness. His reserve in a\r\ncircle is well adapted to banish all manner of suspicion, and he is the\r\nmore amiable when in a tête-à-tête; not that I yet have had one with\r\nhim on my own account. I am only his confidant: but under this mask of\r\nfriendship, I think I see a strong inclination for me, and I already\r\nfeel a violent one for him. It would be pity so much wit and delicacy\r\nshould be sacrificed and stupified with that little idiot Volanges. I\r\nhope he deceives himself in thinking he loves her; she is so far from\r\ndeserving him. Not that I have the least tincture of jealousy: but it\r\nwould be murder; and I wish to save Danceny. I therefore beg, Viscount,\r\nyou will use your endeavours that he may not come near his Cecilia, as\r\nhe has got the disagreeable custom of calling her. A first liking has\r\nalways an inconceivable power. If he was now to see her, I could not be\r\ncertain of any thing, especially during my absence. At my return, I\r\nshall take every thing on myself, and will answer for the success.\r\n\r\nI had some notion of taking the young man with me; but sacrificed\r\nmy inclination to my usual prudence: moreover, I mould have been\r\napprehensive he might make some observations on Belleroche and me; an\r\nidea even of such a thing would distract me; as I wish to offer myself\r\nimmaculate to his imagination: such as one should be to be worthy of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Oct._ 15, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXIV.\r\n\r\n_The_ Presidente de Tourvel _to_ Madame de Rosemonde.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear friend, my uneasiness for the state of your health is so great,\r\nI cannot forbear writing to you. Without knowing whether you will be\r\nable to answer me, I cannot avoid interrogating you. M. de Valmont’s\r\nstate, which you tell me _is not dangerous_, does not, however,\r\ndispel my apprehensions so much as it does yours. It is no novelty\r\nthat melancholy and distaste for company should be symptoms of an\r\napproaching disease; bodily disorders, as well as those of the mind,\r\nincline us to solitude; and we often load those with ill temper, whose\r\ndisorder we ought to compassionate.\r\n\r\nI think he ought, at least, consult with some one. How happens it,\r\nthat being yourself indisposed, you have not a physician? Mine, who I\r\nsent for this morning, and whom, for I will not conceal it from you,\r\nI consulted indirectly, is of opinion, that with persons of naturally\r\nan active disposition, this kind of sudden apathy should by no means\r\nbe neglected. He told me, moreover, disorders will not give way to\r\nremedies, when they have been neglected in the beginning. Why then run\r\nsuch a hazard with one so dear to you?\r\n\r\nIt adds greatly to my uneasiness, I have not had any news of him these\r\nfour days. Good God! I beg you will not deceive me on his state! Why\r\nis it he has left off writing to me so suddenly? If it was only the\r\neffect of my obstinacy in returning his letters, I believe he would\r\nhave taken the resolution sooner. Without having, however, any faith\r\nin forebodings, for these few days I have been in a most melancholy\r\nsituation. I fear I am on the eve of some great misfortune. You cannot\r\nimagine, and I am ashamed to tell you, how much I regret not receiving\r\nthose letters which I refused to read. I was certain he at least\r\nthought of me, and saw something that came from his hands. I did not\r\nopen them, but I wept over them: my tears were softer, and flowed\r\nwith more ease; they only partly dissipated the habitual oppression I\r\nexperience since my return. I conjure you, my most respectable friend,\r\nto write to me yourself as soon as you can; in the mean time, pray\r\nindulge me every day in hearing from you, and of him.\r\n\r\nI now perceive, I have scarcely said a word to you: but you know my\r\nsentiments, my unreserved attachment, my tender gratitude, for your\r\nsincere friendship. You will forgive my distress, my painful anguish,\r\nfor dreading evils of which I am, perhaps, the cause. Merciful God!\r\nthis desponding idea pursues me and wrings my heart. This misfortune\r\nonly was wanting. I know I am born to experience them all.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear friend! love me, pity me. Shall I hear from you this day?\r\n\r\n_Paris, Oct._ 16, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXV.\r\n\r\n_The_ Viscount de Valmont _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a most unaccountable thing, my charming friend, when we are at\r\na remote distance, we cannot so readily understand each other. Whilst\r\nI was near you, we always had the same sentiments, and viewed every\r\nobject in the same light; because I am now about three months absent,\r\nwe are no longer of the same opinion on any thing. Which of us is in\r\nthe wrong? You certainly will not hesitate in your answer: but I, more\r\nwise, or more polite, will not decide. I shall only reply to your\r\nletter, and continue to lay my conduct open.\r\n\r\nFirst, accept my thanks for the intelligence of the reports flying\r\nabout me; that does not make me uneasy: I think soon I shall be\r\nfurnished with materials to silence them all. Have a little patience; I\r\nshall again appear more celebrated than ever, and more worthy of you.\r\n\r\nI expect even they will give me credit for the affair of the little\r\nVolanges, which you affect to treat as such a trifle: as if there was\r\nno merit in carrying in one night a young girl from a favoured lover;\r\nto make use of her after as much as one chooses, even as their own\r\nproperty, and without any farther trouble; to obtain from her what\r\none dare not even require from girls whose vocation it is; and all\r\nthis without in the least disturbing her tender affection; without\r\nmaking her inconstant, or even false; for certainly I don’t engage her\r\nimagination. So that after my fancy is at an end, I will deliver her\r\ninto her lover’s arms, without, as I may say, her having taken notice\r\nof any thing. Pray is that so common an exploit? Yet believe, when she\r\nis gone from under my tuition, the principles I have instilled into her\r\nwill nevertheless display themselves; and I prophesy, the timid scholar\r\nwill take a flight that will do honour to her master.\r\n\r\nIf, however, they like heroics better, I will show my Presidente;\r\nthis model cited for every virtue, respected even by our greatest\r\nlibertines; insomuch, they had given up the idea of attacking her. I\r\nwill show her, forgetting duty and virtue, sacrificing her reputation\r\nand two years prudence to run after the happiness of pleasing me;\r\nintoxicated with love; sufficiently recompensed for so many sacrifices\r\nby a word, a look, which yet she will not always obtain. I will do\r\nmore, I will even abandon her; and if I know this woman, I shall not\r\nhave a successor; she will resist the necessity of consolation; the\r\nhabitude of pleasure; even the thirst for revenge: she shall have\r\nexisted for me only; and let her career be long or short, I alone will\r\nhave opened and shut the barrier; when once I rise to this triumph, I\r\nwill tell my rivals, “that is my exploit, search the world for such an\r\nexample.”\r\n\r\nYou ask me whence proceeds this excessive confidence? Why, for\r\neight days past, I am my fair one’s confidant; she does not tell me\r\nher secrets, but I come at them; two of her letters have given me\r\nsufficient information; the rest I will only read out of curiosity.\r\nI now absolutely want nothing to crown my success but admittance, my\r\nmeasures are taken; I shall immediately execute them. I think you are\r\ncurious; but to punish you for not believing my intentions, you shall\r\nnot know them; you really in earnest deserve I should withdraw my\r\nconfidence from you, at least, for this adventure; were it not for the\r\ntender reward you have attached to its success, I would not mention it\r\nagain. You see I am vexed; however, in hopes of your amendment, I will\r\nbe satisfied with this slight reprimand, and my indulgent mind for a\r\nmoment, forgetting my grand project, shall employ itself on yours.\r\n\r\nYou are then in the country, dull as sentiment, and sorrowful as\r\nfidelity; and poor Belleroche, not satisfied with making him drink the\r\nwaters of oblivion, you will also put him to the torture; how does he\r\nlike it? Does he bear the nausea of love well? I would rather than\r\na great deal he should become more attached to you; I am curious to\r\nlearn what more efficacious remedy you would use; I really pity you,\r\nto have been obliged to have recourse to that. Never did I make love\r\nbut once methodically; I certainly had a strong motive, as it was\r\nwith the Countess de ——; and twenty times in her arms have I been\r\ntempted to tell her, “Madam, I renounce the place I solicit, and permit\r\nme to quit that I occupy.” Of all the women I have had, she is the\r\nonly one of whom I take pleasure in speaking ill. Your motive, I must\r\nown, is truly ridiculous, and you was right in thinking I should not\r\nguess the successor:—What, then, is it for Danceny you have taken all\r\nthis trouble? Ah, my dear friend, let him alone to adore _his virtuous\r\nCecilia_, and do not commit yourself in this children’s play; leave the\r\nscholars to be formed by good old women, or play with the pensioners at\r\npretty innocent games. What, would you instruct a novice who neither\r\nknows how to take or leave you, for whom you must do every thing? I\r\ntell you seriously, I disapprove your choice; and let it be ever so\r\nsecret, it will humble you in my mind, and your own conscience. You say\r\nyou have taken a great liking to him; for shame! you certainly deceive\r\nyourself. I think I have discovered the cause of your error; this fine\r\ndisgust for Belleroche happened at a time of scarcity, and Paris not\r\noffering any choice, your lively ideas fixed on the first object they\r\nmet; but remember, at your return you may choose among a thousand;\r\nand if you dread the inaction you risk falling into in deferring your\r\nchoice, I offer myself for your amusement at your leisure hours. From\r\nthis time until your arrival, my great affairs will be determined\r\none way or other; certainly neither the little Volanges, nor the\r\nPresidente even, will employ me so much, but I may devote myself to\r\nyou as much as you wish; perhaps even before that time, I may have\r\ndelivered the little one into the hands of her discreet lover. Say\r\nwhat you please, which I don’t agree to, that it is not an _attaching_\r\nenjoyment, as I intended she should ever retain an idea of me superior\r\nto all the rest of mankind, I assumed such a tone with her as I could\r\nnot support long without prejudice to my health; and from this moment\r\nI am no longer hers only for family duty. You don’t understand me;\r\nI mean I wait a second period to confirm my hopes, and give me full\r\nassurance I have amply succeeded in my scheme. Yes, my dear friend,\r\nI have already a first indication that my scholar’s husband will not\r\ndie without posterity, and the chief of the house of Gercourt will\r\nbe a younger brother of that of Valmont. But let me finish to my own\r\nliking this business which I undertook at your request: remember if you\r\nmake Danceny inconstant, you deprive the adventure of its poignancy.\r\nConsider also, in offering myself to you, I have a right to a\r\npreference.\r\n\r\nI depend so much upon it, I was not afraid to counteract your designs\r\nin even assisting to increase the tender passion of the discreet\r\nlover, for the first and worthy object of his choice. Having yesterday\r\nfound your pupil writing to him, and disturbed her in this pleasing\r\ntask, for another still more pleasing: I afterwards desired to see the\r\nletter; as it was too cold and constrained, I made her sensible it\r\nwas not thus she should console her lover, and made her write another\r\nwhich I dictated; where, imitating her nonsense as well as I could, I\r\nendeavoured to feed the young man’s passion by more certain hopes; the\r\nlittle, creature was overjoyed, she said, to find she wrote so well,\r\nand hereafter I should hold the correspondence. What have I not done\r\nfor this Danceny! I have been at once his friend, his confidant, his\r\nrival, and his mistress; even at this instant, I am endeavouring to\r\nsave him from your dangerous toils: ay, dangerous; for to possess, and\r\nthen lose you, is purchasing a moment’s happiness with an eternity of\r\nregret.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my lovely friend! muster up resolution to dispatch Belleroche as\r\nsoon as possible; think no more of Danceny; and prepare to again find\r\nand return me the delicious pleasures of our first connection.\r\n\r\n_Oct._ 19, 17—.\r\n\r\nP. S. I congratulate you on the approaching decision of your great\r\ncause; I should be very happy this event should occur during my reign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXVI.\r\n\r\nChevalier Danceny _to_ Cecilia Volanges.\r\n\r\n\r\nMadame de Merteuil set out this morning for the country; thus am I\r\ndeprived, my charming Cecilia; of my only remaining consolation in your\r\nabsence, of conversing of you with our mutual friend: she has given me\r\nleave for some time past to distinguish her by that title; I accepted\r\nit the more eagerly, as it has something the appearance of drawing\r\nme nearer to you; she is a most amiable woman, and knows how to add\r\nthe most attractive charms to friendship:—It would seem as if this\r\npleasing sensation was embellished and strengthened in her the more,\r\nfor what she refuses to love. You cannot imagine how much she loves\r\nyou; how pleased she is to hear me speak of you: it is this certainly\r\nthat attaches me so much to her. What happiness, to exist only for you\r\nboth! to make such sudden transitions from the ecstasy of love, to the\r\ncharms of friendship; to devote my life to it; to be in some measure\r\nthe point of re-union to your reciprocal attachment; to be convinced\r\nthe happiness of the one is also that of the other.\r\n\r\nYou cannot, my charming Cecilia, love this adorable woman too much:\r\nadd to my attachment for her, by sharing it with me. Now I experience\r\nthe charms of friendship, I wish you also to taste them; I think no\r\nenjoyment complete you do not partake of: Yes, my dear Cecilia, I wish\r\nto inspire you with all the tender sentiments; that every idea should\r\nconvey happiness to you; and would still think I returned you only a\r\nportion of the felicity I have received from you.\r\n\r\nAlas! those enchanting dreams are only the pleasing fancies of\r\nimagination, and reality only offers me mortifying privations. I now\r\nplainly see I must give up the flattering hope of seeing you in the\r\ncountry: my sole consolation is endeavouring to be persuaded you cannot\r\naccomplish it, and you do not choose to afflict me more by informing me\r\nof it; twice already have I lamented this disappointment, and received\r\nno reply:—Ah! Cecilia, I really believe you love me with your whole\r\nsoul, but your heart is not so ardent as mine. If the obstacles were\r\nleft to me to be removed, or my own interests to be managed instead\r\nof yours, I would soon convince you nothing was impossible to love.\r\nYou do not inform me even when this cruel absence is to be at an end:\r\nhere surely I can see you; your enchanting looks would revive my\r\nsorrowful heart which is almost totally depressed: forgive, my dear\r\nCecilia, my fears, they are not suspicious; I place implicit faith in\r\nyour love, in your constancy; I should be too miserable, had I any\r\ndoubts; but so many obstacles still renewed—I am, my dear, very much\r\ndejected:—Madame de Merteuil’s departure has renewed all my sorrows.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear Cecilia, adieu!—Remember your lover is in affliction,\r\nand you only can make him happy.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Oct._ 17, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXVII.\r\n\r\nCecilia Volanges _to the_ Chevalier Danceny.\r\n\r\n(_Dictated by Valmont._)\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you think my dear friend there is any necessity to be angry with me\r\nto make me melancholy, when I know you to be in affliction; and do you\r\nthink I have not my share of sufferings as well as you? I even partake\r\nof those I am obliged to give you; and still you are unjust. I see\r\nplainly what puts you out of temper; it is because I was silent to the\r\ntwo requisitions you made to me here; do you think an answer to it is\r\nso easy to give? Do you think I do not know what you want is not right?\r\nAnd if I am so distressed to refuse you at such a distance, how would\r\nit be if you was here? Then again I must be afflicted all my life for\r\ngiving you a moments consolation.\r\n\r\nI hide nothing from you, I give you my reasons, you may judge for\r\nyourself; I should perhaps have done what you wish, had it not been\r\nfor what I wrote you, that M. de Gercourt, who is the cause of all our\r\ntrouble, will not come so soon; and as mama is greatly pleased with\r\nme now, I caress her as much as possible; who knows what I may bring\r\nher to: if we could be happy without having any thing to reproach\r\nmyself with, surely it would be much better. If I am to believe what\r\nI have often heard, that men, when they have loved their wives before\r\nmarriage, do not love them so much after; the dread of that restrains\r\nme more than any thing:—Are you not sure of my heart, and will there\r\nnot be always time enough.\r\n\r\nI promise you, if I cannot avoid marrying M. de Gercourt, who I already\r\nhate without knowing him, nothing shall prevent me from being yours as\r\nmuch as I can, even before any thing, as I do not mind being loved by\r\nany but you:—you will see if I act wrong it shall not be my fault; the\r\nrest is indifferent to me, provided you promise to love me always as\r\nmuch as you do now:—but until then let me be as I am; and do not ask a\r\nthing I have good reasons not to do, and am vexed to refuse you.\r\n\r\nI would likewise be very glad M. de Valmont would not be so pressing on\r\nyour account, which only makes me more unhappy: he is your very good\r\nfriend I assure you; he does every thing as you would do yourself; but\r\nadieu, my dear friend! it was late when I began to write, and spent a\r\ngood part of the night at it. I am going to bed to retrieve the time I\r\nlost. I embrace you; but do not scold me any more.\r\n\r\n_Castle of ——, Oct._ 18, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXVIII.\r\n\r\nChevalier Danceny _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I am to credit my almanack, my charming friend, you are absent only\r\ntwo days; but my heart tells me it is an age. According to your own\r\ndoctrine then, the heart must always be believed. It is time you should\r\nreturn: surely your affairs should be finished by this time. How can I\r\nbe any way concerned in the success of you law suit, as I must suffer\r\nby your absence? I am now much inclined to scold; and it is really\r\nhard, being so ripe for bad humour, I dare not give way to it.\r\n\r\nIs it not a species of infidelity, to leave your friend, after having\r\naccustomed him not to be able to exist out of your presence? Your\r\nlawyers will even find it difficult to defend so bad a cause: besides,\r\nthose gentlemen generally make use of arguments which are not valid\r\nanswers to sentiments.\r\n\r\nYou have given me so many for this journey, that I am sick of them, and\r\nwill pay no farther attention to them, were they even to persuade me to\r\nforget you. Yet that would not be so unreasonable, nor so difficult,\r\nas you may imagine: it would be only laying aside the habit of always\r\nthinking of you; for nothing here, I can assure you, would ever recall\r\nyou to my memory.\r\n\r\nOur prettiest women, those even called the most amiable, are so\r\ninferior to you, that they could give but a very faint idea indeed.\r\nI even think, that, with all their practised looks, the more one\r\nmight at first think that they resembled you, the more striking the\r\ndifference would afterwards appear. In vain do they use their utmost\r\nexertions; they always fail being you; and that precisely constitutes\r\nthe charm. Unfortunately, when the days are so long, and one is\r\nunoccupied, reveries, ideal projects, and chimeras, fill the brain; the\r\nmind acquires a degree of elevation. We are intent on ornamenting our\r\nproductions; we collect together every thing that can please; we arrive\r\nat length at perfection; and when we are there, the portrait brings us\r\nback to the original, and one is quite astonished to see that you were\r\nthe only object of all these turns of the mind. Even at this moment I\r\nam the dupe of pretty much the same sort of error. You fancy, perhaps,\r\nthat it was in order to employ myself on your subject, that I resolved\r\nto write to you—not at all: it was in order to direct my attention a\r\nlittle from you. I have a hundred things to tell you, of which you were\r\nnot the object, and which, nevertheless, you very well know concern me\r\nnearly; and yet it is from these things my attention is led away. Since\r\nwhen, then, do the charms of Friendship dissipate those of Love? If I\r\nconsidered it narrowly, perhaps I should have to reproach myself—but\r\nhush! Let us forget that small fault, lest we relapse into it; and let\r\neven my best female friend be in ignorance of it.\r\n\r\nWhy are you absent? Why not here to give me an answer? To recall me if\r\nI should stray? To talk to me of my Cecilia? To add, if possible, to\r\nthe happiness I experience in loving her, by the additionally charming\r\nidea that it is your friend I love? Yes, I avow the love she inspires\r\nme, is become more precious. Since you have been kind enough to become\r\nthe confidant of it, I feel so great a pleasure in opening my heart to\r\nyou, in interesting yours in my sentiments, in depositing them there\r\nwithout reserve! I think them the more dear to me in proportion as\r\nyou condescend to hear them; that I look at you, and say to myself,\r\nIt is in her that all my happiness is centered. I have nothing new to\r\ninform you of as to my situation. The last letter I received from her\r\nincreases, and gives a degree of security to my hopes; though she still\r\nbrings a delay to them, yet her motives are so tender and honourable,\r\nthat I can neither blame her, nor complain of it. Perhaps this is\r\nobscure to you; but why are you not here? Though we can say every\r\nthing to a friend, every thing cannot be written. The secrets of love\r\nespecially, are so delicate, that one ought not to let them go in that\r\nway, relying on honour. If they are sometimes permitted to go abroad,\r\nthey never should be permitted to go out of sight; they ought even to\r\nbe watched back to their new asylum. Return, then my adorable friend;\r\nyou see your return is necessary: forget, then, the _thousand reasons_\r\nthat detain you where you are, or teach me to live where you are not.\r\n\r\nI have the honour to be, &c.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Oct._ 16, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXIX.\r\n\r\nMadame de Rosemonde _to the_ Presidente de Tourvel.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough, still suffering much pain, my lovely dear, I endeavour to\r\nwrite to you myself, in order to tell you what interests you so much.\r\nMy nephew still preserves his misanthropy: he sends every day regularly\r\nto enquire about my health; but has never come once in person, although\r\nI requested it; so that we see no more of him than if he was at Paris.\r\nThis morning, however, I met him, when least expected: it was in my\r\nchapel, where I came down for the first time since my painful disorder.\r\nThey inform me, for four days past he goes there regularly every\r\nmorning to mass. God grant it may last.\r\n\r\nWhen I entered, he congratulated me very affectionately on my recovery.\r\nAs mass was beginning, we broke off the conversation, expecting to\r\nrenew it afterwards: he disappeared before I could join him again. I\r\nwill not conceal from you, he is something altered; but, my lovely\r\ndear, do not make me repent my confidence in your good sense, by your\r\ntoo great uneasiness; and be assured I would rather afflict than\r\ndeceive you.\r\n\r\nIf my nephew continues to treat me so severely, I am resolved, when I\r\nam something better, to visit him in his chamber, and endeavour to dive\r\ninto the cause of this extraordinary madness, in which you certainly\r\nhave some share. The result of my observations you shall be informed. I\r\nmust leave off, not being able to stir my fingers. If Adelaide knew I\r\nhad been writing, she would be very much vexed. Adieu, my lovely dear!\r\n\r\n_Castle of_ ——, _Oct._ 20, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXX.\r\n\r\nViscount de Valmont _to_ Father Anselmus,\r\n\r\n(_Of the Feuillant Convent, St. Honoré Street._)\r\n\r\n\r\nNot having the honour of being known to you, Sir, but thoroughly\r\nacquainted with the well-placed confidence Madame the Presidente de\r\nTourvel reposes in you, I think I may address myself to you without\r\nbeing guilty of indiscretion, to obtain an essential piece of service,\r\ntruly worthy your holy ministry, wherein Madame de Tourvel’s advantage\r\nis equally concerned with mine.\r\n\r\nHaving in my possession some papers of consequence that concern her\r\nnearly, and should not be entrusted to any person, which I neither\r\nought or will deliver but into her own hands. Being deprived of the\r\nmeans of informing her of this resolution, for reasons which you may\r\nprobably have learned from her, but which I do not think myself at\r\nliberty to acquaint you with, she determined to refuse corresponding\r\nwith me; a determination which I do not now in the least blame, as\r\nshe could not foresee events, so unexpected, and which required the\r\nsupernatural power, that one is forced to acknowledge for their\r\ncompletion. Therefore I request, Sir, you will be so good to inform her\r\nof my new resolves, and ask, in my name, a particular interview, where\r\nI may in some measure repair the injuries I have been guilty of by my\r\napologies; and, as the last sacrifice, annihilate, in her presence, the\r\nonly remaining impressions of an error or crime, which made me culpable\r\ntowards her.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be until after this preliminary expiation, I shall dare, at\r\nyour knees, make the humiliating, avowal of my long bad conduct, and\r\nimplore your mediation, for a still more important, and, unhappily,\r\na much more difficult reconciliation. May I hope, Sir, you will not\r\nrefuse me your assistance in a business so necessary and so important;\r\nand that you will vouchsafe to aid my weakness, and guide my steps in\r\nthis new path, which I ardently wish to follow, and to which, with\r\nshame, I own myself an utter stranger.\r\n\r\nI wait your answer with the impatience of repentance that wishes to\r\nreform; and beg you will believe me to be, with as much gratitude as\r\nveneration,\r\n\r\nYour most humble, &c.\r\n\r\nP. S. I authorise you, Sir, if you think proper, to communicate this\r\nletter entirely to Madame de Tourvel, who I shall make it my duty to\r\nrespect during the rest of my days, and whom I shall never cease to\r\nrevere, as the instrument heaven has been pleased to use to bring me\r\nback to virtue, by the striking example of her own.\r\n\r\n_Castle of_ ——, _Oct._ 22, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXI.\r\n\r\n_The_ Marchioness de Merteuil _to_ Chevalier Danceny.\r\n\r\n\r\nI received your letter, my very young friend, and must scold you before\r\nyou receive my thanks for it; farther I warn you, if you do not amend,\r\nyou shall not have any answer from me. Leave, then, that wheedling\r\nstyle, which is but mere cant, when it is not the expression of love.\r\nIs it the style of friendship? No, my dear friend; each sentiment\r\nhas its peculiar language suitable to it; and to use another, is to\r\ndisguise the thought we should express. I am well aware our silly women\r\ndo not understand what is said to them, unless it is translated in some\r\nshape into this fashionable nonsense: but I imagined you would have\r\ndistinguished me from them. I am really hurt, and, perhaps, more than I\r\nought, you should imbibe such an opinion of me.\r\n\r\nYou will find in my letter what is wanting in yours, frankness and\r\nsimplicity. As I shall say, it would give me infinite pleasure to see\r\nyou, and am grieved to have only those about me who stupify me instead\r\nof those that give me pleasure; but you translate this same phrase\r\nthus: _Teach me to live where you are absent_; thus, suppose you was\r\nwith your mistress, you could not live was I absent. What a misfortune!\r\nAnd these women _that always fail being me!_ You will find, perhaps,\r\nthat wanting also to your Cecilia! This, however, is the style which,\r\nby the abuse now made of it, is beneath the nonsense of compliment, and\r\nbecomes a mere precedent, to which no more attention is paid than to\r\nyour most humble servant.\r\n\r\nMy dear friend, when you write to me, let it be to express your\r\nthoughts and feelings, and do not stuff your letter with phrases,\r\nwhich I shall find, without your assistance, well or ill told in the\r\nfirst romance of the day. I hope you will not be displeased at what\r\nI now say, if even you should discover some peevishness in it; for\r\nit must not be denied I am a little so at present. To avoid even the\r\nshadow of the defect with which I reproach you, you must not be told,\r\nperhaps, this peevishness is not a little increased by the distance I\r\nam from you. And I am inclined to think, all things considered, you are\r\nmore eligible than a law suit and two lawyers, and, perhaps, even the\r\n_attentive_ Belleroche.\r\n\r\nObserve, instead of being afflicted at my absence, you should\r\nbe highly gratified; for I never before paid you so handsome a\r\ncompliment. Your example influences me; I shall be apt to wheedle.\r\nNo; I will retain my sincerity: it alone assures you of my tender\r\nfriendship, and the interesting things it inspires. Is it not very\r\npleasing to have a young friend, whose inclinations lead him elsewhere?\r\nHowever, that is not the system of the generality of women, but it is\r\nmine. I always thought the pleasure greater, and more satisfactory,\r\nin a sentiment where there is no apprehension. Don’t you think I have\r\nassumed the character of confidant for you tolerably soon: but you\r\nchoose your mistress so young, that, for the first time, I begin to\r\nthink I grow old. You are certainly right, thus to prepare yourself for\r\na long career of constancy; and I sincerely wish it may be reciprocal.\r\n\r\nYou do right to cherish the _tender and honourable motives_, which you\r\nsay _retard your hopes._ A long defence is the only merit of those who\r\ndo not always resist; and I should think it unpardonable in any other\r\nbut a child, like the little Volanges, not to fly a danger, of which\r\nshe has had sufficient warning by the confession she made of her love.\r\nYou men have no idea of virtue, and what the sacrifice of it costs\r\na woman; but if she is capable of reasoning, she should know, that\r\nindependent of the fault she commits, a single weakness is one of the\r\ngreatest misfortunes; and I cannot conceive how any can fall, if they\r\nhave a moment for reflection.\r\n\r\nDo not attempt to combat this idea: it principally attaches me to you.\r\nYou will save me from the dangers of love; and although I have hitherto\r\nguarded myself against them without your assistance, yet I consent to\r\nbe grateful, and shall love you more and the better for it.\r\n\r\nOn which, my dear chevalier, I pray God to have you in his holy keeping.\r\n\r\n_Castle of_ ——, _Oct._ 22, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXII.\r\n\r\nMadame de Rosemonde _to the_ Presidente de Tourvel.\r\n\r\n\r\nI flattered myself, my lovely daughter, to have been able to calm your\r\nuneasiness; with grief, however, I am forced still to increase it;\r\nyet be pacified, my nephew is not in any dangerous way. I cannot even\r\nsay he is really sick. Still there is something very extraordinary\r\nin his disorder, which is incomprehensible. I left his chamber with\r\nsensations of grief, and even of terror, which I blame myself for\r\nimparting to you, and still cannot conceal. I will give you an account\r\nof the transaction. You may depend on its veracity; Were I to live\r\neighty years more, I should never forget this melancholy scene.\r\n\r\nI went this morning to see my nephew. He was writing, surrounded with a\r\nheap of papers, which appeared to be the object of his employment. He\r\nwas so deeply engaged, I was in the middle of the room before he looked\r\nabout to see who came in. As soon as he perceived me, I observed, as\r\nhe rose, he endeavoured to compose his countenance, and perhaps it was\r\nthat made me pay more attention to it. He was undressed, and without\r\npowder; but his countenance pale, wan, and very much altered; his look,\r\nwhich used to be so gay and lively, was melancholy and dejected: and,\r\nbetween ourselves, I would not for any consideration you had seen him\r\nthus, for his whole deportment was very affecting, and the most apt\r\nto inspire that tender compassion, which is one of the most dangerous\r\nsnares of love.\r\n\r\nAlthough struck with those remarks, yet I began a conversation as if I\r\nhad not taken notice of any thing. First, I enquired about his health;\r\nand without saying it was very good, he did not complain of its being\r\nbad. I then began to lament his recluseness, which had something the\r\nappearance of a disordered fancy, and endeavoured to mingle a little\r\nsprightliness with my reprimand: but he replied in an affecting tone;\r\n“I confess it is another error, which shall be repaired with the rest.”\r\nHis looks more than his reply, disconcerted my cheerfulness; and I\r\ntold him, he took up a little friendly reproach in too serious a\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nWe then began to chat on indifferent matters. A little while after he\r\ntold me, an affair, _the greatest affair of his whole life_, would,\r\nperhaps, soon call him back to Paris. I was afraid to guess at it,\r\nmy lovely dear; and lest this beginning should lead to a confidence\r\nI did not wish, asked him no questions, but only replied, a little\r\ndissipation might put him in better health; saying, at this time I\r\nwould not press him, as loving my friends for their own sake. At this\r\nso simple a speech, he squeezed my hands, and with a vehemence I can’t\r\nexpress, “Yes, my dear aunt,” said he, “love a nephew who respects and\r\ncherishes you, and, as you say, love him for his own sake. Do not be\r\nafflicted at his happiness, and do not disturb with any sorrow, the\r\neternal tranquillity he soon hopes to enjoy. Repeat once more, you\r\nlove me, you forgive me; yes, you will forgive me; I know the goodness\r\nof your heart: but can I hope for the same indulgence from those I have\r\nso grievously offended?” Then leaned down towards me, as I believe to\r\nconceal some marks of grief, which, however, the tone of his voice\r\nbetrayed.\r\n\r\nInexpressibly affected, I rose suddenly; and he, no doubt, observed\r\nmy affright, for instantly composing himself, he replied, “Your\r\npardon, Madam, I perceive I am wandering in spite of me. I beg you\r\nwill remember my profound respect, and forget my expressions. I shall\r\nnot omit waiting on you before my departure to renew them.” This\r\nlast sentence seemed to imply a wish, I should terminate my visit; I\r\naccordingly retired.\r\n\r\nI am lost in reflection, as to his meaning. What can this affair be,\r\n_the greatest of his whole life?_ On what account should he ask my\r\npardon? From whence could that involuntary melting proceed whilst he\r\nwas speaking? I have since put myself those questions a thousand times,\r\nwithout being able to solve them. I can’t even discover any thing\r\nrelative to you; yet, as the eyes of love are more penetrating than\r\nthose of friendship, I would not conceal any thing from you that passed\r\nbetween my nephew and me.\r\n\r\nThis is the fourth time I have sat down to write this long letter,\r\nwhich I should yet have made longer, but for the fatigue I undergo.\r\nAdieu, my lovely dear!\r\n\r\n_Castle of_ ——, _Oct._ 25, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXIII.\r\n\r\nFather Anselmus _to the_ Viscount de Valmont.\r\n\r\n\r\nI received, Monsieur Viscount, the letter you did me the honour to\r\nwrite to me, and yesterday, as you requested, waited on the person\r\nmentioned. I laid before her the motives and intentions that induced\r\nyou to this measure. Although very determined to pursue the prudent\r\nresolution she at first took, yet on the remonstrances I made, that by\r\na refusal she might incur the danger of throwing an obstacle in the way\r\nof your conversion and in a manner oppose the designs of all-merciful\r\nProvidence, she consented to receive your visit, on condition\r\nnevertheless, it shall be the last; and has desired me to inform you,\r\nshe should be at home on Thursday next, the 28th. If this day should\r\nnot be convenient for you, please to inform her, and appoint some\r\nother; your letter will be received.\r\n\r\nGive me leave to recommend to you, Sir, to avoid delays, unless for\r\nvery cogent reasons, that you may as soon as possible give yourself up\r\nentirely to the laudable dispositions you express. Remember, whoever\r\nis silent to the calls of divine grace, exposes himself to have it\r\nwithdrawn; that if the divine bounty is infinite, the dispensation of\r\nit is regulated by justice; and the time may come, when the God of\r\nmercy may be changed to a God of vengeance.\r\n\r\nIf you continue to honour me with your confidence, be assured all\r\nmy care shall be devoted to you the instant you require it. Let my\r\nbusiness be ever so great, the most important shall ever be to fulfil\r\nthe duties of the holy ministry, to which I am particularly devoted;\r\nand the most valuable part of my life, that wherein I see my weak\r\nendeavours crowned with the benediction of the Most High. We are weak\r\nsinners, and cannot do any thing of ourselves! but the God that now\r\ncalls you is omnipotent; and we shall equally owe to his goodness; you\r\nthe desire of being reunited to him, and I the means of conducting\r\nyou. It is with his divine assistance, I hope soon to convince you,\r\nthat religion only can give even in this world that solid and durable\r\nhappiness, which is vainly sought in the blindness of human passions. I\r\nhave the honour to be, with great respect, &c.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Oct._ 25, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXIV.\r\n\r\n_The_ Presidente de Tourvel _to_ Madame de Rosemonde.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe astonishment in which I am thrown, Madam, at the news I received\r\nyesterday, will not, however, make me forget the satisfaction it ought\r\nto give you, therefore I am in haste to impart it. M. de Valmont’s\r\nthoughts are no longer taken up with me or his love; he wishes nothing\r\nmore ardently, than to repair, by a more edifying life, the faults, or\r\nrather the errors of his youth. This great event was announced to me\r\nby Father Anselmus, whom he addressed to be his director in future,\r\nand to treat with me of an interview, the principal design of which\r\nis, I imagine, to return my letters, which he has kept hitherto,\r\nnotwithstanding my requisitions.\r\n\r\nI cannot undoubtedly but applaud this happy change, and congratulate\r\nmyself, if, as he says, I have any way contributed to it. But why\r\nshould I have been the instrument, and that at the expence of my repose\r\nfor life? Could not M. de Valmont’s happiness be completed but by my\r\nmisfortune? Oh! forgive me this complaint, my most indulgent friend!\r\nI know it does not belong to mortals to fathom the decrees of heaven.\r\nWhilst I am incessantly and vainly imploring strength to overcome my\r\nunfortunate passion, it is prodigal of its favour to him who does not\r\nsue for it, and leaves me helpless a prey to my weakness.\r\n\r\nLet me stifle those guilty murmurs. Did not the prodigal son at his\r\nreturn, find more grace with his father, than the one who never had\r\nbeen absent? What account can we demand of him who owes us nothing?\r\nAnd were it possible we could have any pretensions in the sight of God,\r\nwhat could mine be? Should I boast of a modesty, for which I am only\r\nindebted to Valmont? It was he saved me; and shall I dare complain\r\nof suffering for him? No, my sufferings shall be dear to me, if his\r\nhappiness is purchased at their expence. Doubtless, in his turn he\r\nshould come back to our common father. The almighty hand that formed\r\nhim should cherish its own work. He did not create that charming\r\nbeing to be reprobated. It is me should bear the pain of my daring\r\nimprudence. Should I not have reflected, since I was forbid loving him,\r\nI should not indulge myself in gazing on him.\r\n\r\nMy fault or misfortune is to have rejected this truth too long. You,\r\nmy dear and worthy friend, will be my witness, I submitted to this\r\nsacrifice as soon as I discovered the necessity of it: but to render it\r\ncomplete, there wanted the circumstance of M. de Valmont not taking any\r\nshare in it. Shall I confess to you, this is the idea that at present\r\ntorments me most? Intolerable pride! which alleviates the evils we\r\nendure, by a consciousness of those woes we cause to others! But I will\r\nconquer this rebellious heart. I will accustom it to humiliation.\r\n\r\nThis, motive exclusive of all other considerations, made me at last\r\nconsent to receive next Thursday, M. de Valmont’s painful visit;—he\r\nwill then tell me he no longer knows me; that the feeble, transitory\r\nimpression I had made on him exists, no longer! He will look upon me\r\nwithout any emotion, whilst the dread of revealing mine will cast my\r\neyes down. Even those very letters which he so long refused to my\r\nrepeated solicitations, I shall receive from his indifference; he will\r\nreturn them as useless trifles he no longer cares for; and my trembling\r\nhand will receive this shameful trust from a tranquil steady one; last\r\nhe will depart!—Depart for ever!—My eyes which will follow him, will\r\nnot see his return to me.\r\n\r\nAm I then reserved for all this humiliation? Let me at least make it\r\nuseful by being penetrated with a sense of my weakness.—Those letters\r\nhe will no longer keep, I will lay up with care:—I will impose on\r\nmyself the shame of daily reading them until my tears have defaced the\r\nlast letter—and his, I will destroy, as infected with the dangerous\r\npoison which has tainted my soul.—What then is love, which makes us\r\nregret even the danger it exposes us to, and dread feeling it, even\r\nwhen we can no longer inspire it? Let me fly this destructive passion,\r\nwhich leaves no choice between shame and misery, and often reunites\r\nthem:—let prudence then replace virtue.\r\n\r\nHow distant is this Thursday still! Why can’t I instantly consummate\r\nthis sorrowful sacrifice, and forget at once the cause and the object?\r\nThis visit importunes me; I repent having promised it—what occasion to\r\nsee me again—what are we now to each other? If he has offended me, I\r\nforgive him—I even congratulate him on his reformation; I praise him\r\nfor it; I do more, I will follow his example; and, seduced by the same\r\nerrors, his example shall reform me. But why, when his resolution is to\r\nfly me, why begin by seeking me? The one that is in most danger, ought\r\nthey not to forget the other? Doubtless they ought; and that shall\r\nhereafter be my sole care.\r\n\r\nWith your permission, my amiable friend, it shall be with you I will\r\nundertake this difficult task; if I should want assistance, or perhaps\r\nconsolation, I will not receive it from any other—you alone understand\r\nand can speak to my heart:—Your endearing friendship will fill up my\r\nexistence;—nothing will be difficult to second your cares:—I shall be\r\nindebted to you for my tranquillity, my happiness, my virtue; and the\r\nfruits of your goodness will be to have at length made me deserving of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI believe I have gone very much astray in this letter, at least I think\r\nso, from the perturbed state I have been in during the whole time:—If\r\nthere is a sentiment which ought to make me blush, cover it with your\r\nindulgent friendship; I submit entirely to it; I have not a wish to\r\nhide from you any emotion of my heart.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my most respectable friend! I hope to be able in a few days to\r\nannounce that of my arrival.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Oct._ 25, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF THE THIRD VOLUME.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDANGEROUS\r\nCONNECTIONS:\r\n\r\nOR,\r\nLETTERS\r\nCOLLECTED IN A SOCIETY,\r\nAND\r\nPUBLISHED FOR THE INSTRUCTION OF\r\nOTHER SOCIETIES.\r\n\r\nBy M.

Yet I never experienced the charm I mean; it is not\r\nlove—for although I have had fits of weakness with this amazing woman,\r\nwhich very much resembled that pusillanimous passion, I ever subdued\r\nthem and returned to my first rules—if even the scene of yesterday\r\nshould have led me farther than I intended; had I partook for a moment\r\nof the intoxication I raised, that transitory illusion would have\r\nbeen now evaporated, yet still the same charm remains—I own I should\r\nbe pleased to indulge it, if it did not give me some uneasiness:—At\r\nmy age must I then be mastered like a school-boy by an unknown and\r\ninvoluntary sentiment?—I must first oppose and then examine it.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I already see into the cause—the idea pleases me—I wish it\r\nmay be true.\r\n\r\nAmong the multitude of women with whom I have played the part of a\r\nlover, I never met any who were not as well inclined to surrender as\r\nI was to persuade them—I used even to call those _prudes_ who met me\r\nbut halfway, in contrast to so many others, whose provoking defence is\r\nintended as a cloak to their first advances.\r\n\r\nBut here I found an unfavourable prepossession against me, afterwards\r\nconfirmed on the report and advice of a penetrating woman who hated me;\r\na natural, excessive timidity, fortified with genuine modesty; a strong\r\nattachment to virtue under the powerful direction of religion, and who\r\nhad already been married two years—an unsullied character—the result\r\nof those causes, which all tended to screen her from my solicitations.\r\n\r\nIt is not any way similar to my former adventures:—a mere capitulation\r\nmore or less advantageous, which is easier to be acquired than to\r\nbe vain of; but this is a complete victory, purchased by a hard\r\ncampaign, and decided by skilful manœuvres, therefore it is not at\r\nall surprising, this success, solely my own acquisition, should be\r\ndear to me; and the increase of pleasure I experienced in my triumph,\r\nwhich I still feel, is no more than the soft impression of a sentiment\r\nof glory. I indulge this thought, as it saves me the humiliation of\r\nharbouring the idea of my being dependent on the very slave I have\r\nbrought under subjection, as well as the disagreeable thoughts of not\r\nhaving within myself the plenitude of my happiness, or that the power\r\nof calling it forth into energy and making me fully enjoy it, should\r\nbe revived for this or that woman exclusively of any other.\r\n\r\nThose judicious reflections shall regulate my conduct on this important\r\noccasion and you may depend, I shall never suffer myself to be so\r\ncaptivated, but that I may at pleasure break those new bands:—Already\r\nI begin to talk of a rapture, and have not yet informed you how I\r\nacquired the powers—proceed and you will see to what dangers wisdom\r\nexposes itself endeavouring to assist folly—I studied my conversation\r\nand the answers to them with so much attention, I hope to be able to\r\ngive you both with the utmost exactitude.\r\n\r\nYou will observe by the annexed copies of letters,[1] what kind of\r\nmediator I fixed on to gain me admittance with my fair one, with\r\nwhat zeal the holy man exercised himself to reunite us; I must tell\r\nyou also, I learned from an intercepted letter, according to custom,\r\nthe dread the humiliation of being left, had a little disconcerted\r\nthe austere devotee’s prudence, and stuffed her head and heart with\r\nideas and sentiments which, though destitute of common sense, were\r\nnevertheless interesting—After these preliminaries necessary to\r\nbe related, yesterday, Thursday the 28th, the day appointed by my\r\ningrate, I presented myself as a timid and repentant slave, to retire a\r\nsuccessful conqueror.\r\n\r\nIt was six in the evening when I came to the fair recluse; for since\r\nher return, her gates were shut against every one. She endeavoured to\r\nrise when I was announced; but her trembling knees being unable to\r\nsupport her, she was obliged to sit down immediately. The servant who\r\nhad showed me in, having something to do in the apartment, she seemed\r\nimpatient. This interval was taken up with the usual compliments. Not\r\nto lose a moment of so precious an opportunity, I examined the room\r\ncarefully, and fixed my eye on the intended spot for my victory. I\r\ncould have chose a more commodious one; for there was a sopha in the\r\nroom: but I observed directly opposite to it a picture of the husband;\r\nand I own I was afraid with so strange a woman, a single glance, which\r\naccidentally she might cast on that side, would in an instant have\r\ndestroyed a work of so much care. At last we were alone, and I entered\r\non the business.\r\n\r\nAfter relating in few words, I supposed Father Anselmus had informed\r\nher the motive of my visit, I lamented the rigorous treatment I\r\nreceived, and dwelt particularly on the _contempt_ that had been shown.\r\nShe made an apology, as I expected, and you also: but I grounded the\r\nproof on the diffidence and dread I had infused; on the scandalous\r\nflight in consequence of it, the refusal to answer my letters, or\r\neven receive them, &c. &c. As she was beginning a justification,\r\nwhich would have been very easy, I thought proper to interrupt her;\r\nand to compensate for this abrupt behaviour, I immediately threw in a\r\nflattery. “If such charms,” said I, “have made so deep an impression on\r\nmy heart, so many virtues have made as great a one on my mind. Seduced\r\nby the desire of imitating them, I had the vanity to think myself\r\nworthy of them. I do not reproach you for thinking otherwise; but I\r\npunish myself for my error.” As she preserved a silent perplexity I\r\nwent on. “I wish, Madam, to be justified in your sight, or obtain your\r\npardon for all the wrongs you suppose me to have been guilty of; that\r\nI may, at least, terminate in tranquillity a life which is no longer\r\nsupportable since you refuse to embellish it.”\r\n\r\nTo this, however, she endeavoured to reply. “My duty would not\r\npermit me.”—The difficulty to finish the fib which duty required,\r\ndid not allow her to end the sentence. I replied in the most tender\r\nstrain, “Is it true, then, it was me you fled from?—this retreat was\r\nnecessary—and that you should put me from you—It must be so—and for\r\never—I should—” It is unnecessary to tell you, during this short\r\ndialogue, the tender prude’s voice was oppressed, and she did not raise\r\nher eyes.\r\n\r\nI thought it was time to animate this languishing scene; and rising\r\nin a pet,—“Your resolution, Madam,” said I, “has given me back mine.\r\nWe will part; and part forever: you will have leisure to congratulate\r\nyourself on your work.” Surprised with this reproaching tone, she\r\nshould have replied—“The resolution you have taken,” said she—“Is only\r\nthe effect of despair,” I replied with passion. “It is your pleasure I\r\nshould be miserable—you shall have the full extent of your wish. I wish\r\nyou to be happy.” Here the voice began to announce a strong emotion:\r\nthen falling at her knees, in the dramatic style, I exclaimed, “Ah,\r\ncruel woman! Can there be happiness for me that you do not partake? How\r\nthen shall I find it, when absent from you? Oh, never, never!”—I own,\r\nin abandoning myself thus, I depended much on the assistance of tears;\r\nbut, whether for want of disposition, or, perhaps, only the continual,\r\npainful attention my mind was engaged in, I could not weep. Fortunately\r\nI recollected, all means are equally good to subdue a woman; and it\r\nwould be sufficient to astonish her by a grand movement, to make a deep\r\nand favourable impression. I therefore made terror supply the place\r\nof absent sensibility; changing only my tone, but still preserving my\r\nposture, I continued, “Yes, at your feet I swear I will die or possess\r\nyou.” As I pronounced those last words our eyes met. I don’t know what\r\nthe timid woman saw, or thought she saw, in mine; but she rose with a\r\nterrified countenance, and escaped from my arms, which surrounded her\r\nwaist: it is true, I did not attempt to hold her; for I have often\r\nobserved, those scenes of despair became ridiculous when pushed with\r\ntoo much vivacity or lengthened out, and left no resource but what was\r\nreally tragic, of which I had not the least idea. Whilst she fled from\r\nme, I added in a low disastrous tone, but so that she might hear, “Well\r\nthen, death.”\r\n\r\nI rose silently, and casting a wild look on her, as if by chance,\r\nnevertheless observed her unsteady deportment, her quick respiration,\r\nher contracted muscles, her trembling, half-raised arms; every thing\r\ngave me sufficient evidence, the effect was such as I wished to\r\nproduce: but as in love nothing can be brought to issue at a distance,\r\nand we were pretty far asunder, it was necessary to draw nearer. To\r\nattain which, I assumed, as soon as possible, an apparent tranquillity,\r\nproper to calm the effects of this violent agitation, without weakening\r\nthe impression. My transition was:—“I am very miserable. I only wished\r\nto live for your happiness, and I have disturbed it:”—then with a\r\ncomposed but constrained air;—“Forgive me, Madam; little used to the\r\nrage of passions, I do not know how to suppress their violence. If I\r\nam wrong in giving way to them, I beg you will remember it shall be the\r\nlast time. Compose yourself; I entreat you compose yourself.” During\r\nthis long discourse, I drew near insensibly. “If you wish I should be\r\ncalm,” replied the terrified fair, “do you then be calm.” “I will then,\r\nI promise you,” said I; and in a weaker tone, “If the effort is great,\r\nit ought not at least to be long: but I came to return your letters. I\r\nrequest you will take them. This afflicting sacrifice is the only one\r\nremaining; let me have nothing to weaken my resolution.” Then drawing\r\nfrom my pocket the precious collection—“Here is the deceitful deposit\r\nof your friendship: it made this life supportable; take it back, and\r\ngive the signal that is to separate us for ever.” Here the timid lover\r\ngave way to her tender grief—“But, M. de Valmont, what is the matter?\r\nWhat do you mean? Is not your proceeding to-day your own voluntary act?\r\nIs it not the result of your own reflections? And is it not they have\r\napproved this necessary step, in compliance with my duty?” I replied,\r\n“Well, this step decides mine.”—“And what is that?”—“The only one\r\nthat can put an end to my sufferings, by parting me from you.”—“But\r\nanswer me what is it.”—Then pressing her in my arms without any\r\nopposition, and observing from the neglect of decency, how strong and\r\npowerful her emotions were, I exclaimed, “Adorable woman! you can’t\r\nconceive the love you inspire. You will never know how much you was\r\nadored, and how much dearer this passion was than my existence. May all\r\nyour days be fortunate and peaceful! May they be decorated with that\r\nhappiness you have deprived me of! At least, repay this sincere wish\r\nwith one sigh, one tear; and be assured, the last sacrifice I make will\r\nnot be the most painful to my heart. Adieu!”\r\n\r\nWhilst I spoke, I felt her heart throb violently; her countenance\r\naltered; her tears almost suffocated her. Then I resolved to feign\r\nretreat: but she held me strongly.—“No, hear what I have to say,”\r\nsaid she, eagerly. I answered, “Let me go.”—“You shall hear me.”—“I\r\nmust fly from you; I must.”—“No,” she exclaimed; then sunk, or rather\r\nswooned in my arms. I was still doubtful of so happy an issue, seemed\r\nmuch terrified, and still led, or rather carried her to the place I had\r\nmarked out for the field of glory. She did not recover herself until\r\nshe was submitted, and given up to her happy conqueror.\r\n\r\nSo far, my lovely friend, you will perceive a methodical neatness,\r\nwhich I am sure will give you pleasure. You will also observe, I did\r\nnot swerve in the least from the true principles of this war, which we\r\nhave often remarked bore so near a resemblance to the other. Rank me,\r\nthen, with the Turennes or the Fredericks. I forced the enemy to fight\r\nwho was temporising. By skilful manœuvres, gained the advantage of\r\nthe ground and dispositions; contrived to lull the enemy into security,\r\nto come up with him more easily in his retreat; struck him with terror\r\nbefore we engaged. I left nothing to chance; only a great advantage,\r\nin case of success; or a certainty of resources, in case of a defeat.\r\nFinally, the action did not begin till I had secured a retreat, by\r\nwhich I might cover and preserve all my former conquests. What more\r\ncould be done? But I begin to fear I have enervated myself, as Hannibal\r\ndid with the delights of Capua.\r\n\r\nI expected so great an event would not pass over without the customary\r\ntears and grief. First I observed somewhat more of confusion and\r\nrecollection than is usual, which I attributed to her state of prudery.\r\nWithout paying much attention to those slight differences, which I\r\nimagined merely local, I followed the beaten road of consolation;\r\nfully persuaded, as commonly happens, the sensations would fly to\r\nthe assistance of sentiment, that one act would prevail more than\r\nall my speeches, which I did not, however, neglect: but I met with a\r\nresistance really tremendous: less for its excess, than the form under\r\nwhich it appeared. Only think of a woman sitting stiff and motionless,\r\nwith unalterable features; seeming divested of the faculties of\r\nthinking, hearing, or understanding, from whose eyes tears flowed\r\nwithout effort. Such was M. de Tourvel during my conversation. If I\r\nendeavoured to recall her attention by a caress, or even the most\r\ninnocent gesture, terror immediately followed this apparent apathy,\r\naccompanied with suffocation, convulsions, sobs, and shrieks by\r\nintervals, but without a word articulated. Those fits returned several\r\ntimes, and always stronger; the last was even so violent, I was much\r\nfrightened, and thought I had gained a fruitless victory. I returned\r\nto the usual common-place phrases—“What do you then regret you have\r\nmade me the happiest man on earth?” At those words this adorable woman\r\nturned to me; her countenance, although still a little wild, had yet\r\nrecovered its celestial expression. “The happiest?” said she.—You may\r\nguess my reply. “You are happy, then?”—I renewed my protestations.\r\n“Have I made you happy?”—I added praises, and every thing tender.\r\nWhilst I was speaking, all her members were stilled; she fell back\r\nsoftly in her chair, giving up a hand I ventured to take. “This idea\r\nrelieves and consoles me,” said she.\r\n\r\nYou well believe, being thus brought back in the right road, I quitted\r\nit no more; it certainly was the best, and, perhaps, the only one.\r\nWhen I made a second attempt, I met some resistance; what had happened\r\nbefore made me more circumspect: but having called on my idea of\r\nhappiness for assistance, I soon experienced its favourable influence.\r\n“You are right,” replied the tender creature, “I can support my\r\nexistence no longer than it contributes to your happiness. I devote\r\nmyself entirely to you. From this moment I give myself up to you. You\r\nshall no more experience regret or refusal from me.” Thus with artless\r\nor sublime candour did she deliver her person and charms, increasing my\r\nhappiness by sharing it. The intoxication was complete and reciprocal:\r\nfor the first time mine survived the pleasure. I quitted her arms, only\r\nto throw myself at her feet, and swear eternal love. To own the truth,\r\nI spoke as I thought. Even after we parted, I could not shake off the\r\nidea; and I found it necessary to make extraordinary efforts to divert\r\nmy attention from her.\r\n\r\nI wish you were now here, to counterpoise the charm of the action by\r\nthe reward: but I hope I shall not lose by waiting; for I look on the\r\nhappy arrangement I proposed in my last letter as a settled point\r\nbetween us. You see I dispatch business as I promised: my affairs will\r\nbe so forward, I shall be able to give you some part of my time.\r\nQuickly get rid, then, of the stupid Belleroche, and leave the whining\r\nDanceny to be engrossed solely by me. How is your time taken up in\r\nthe country? You don’t even answer my letters. Do you know, I have a\r\ngreat mind to scold you? Only prosperity is apt to make us indulgent.\r\nBesides, I can’t forget ranging myself again under your banner. I must\r\nsubmit to your little whim. Remember, however, the new lover will not\r\nsurrender any of the ancient rights of the friend.\r\n\r\nAdieu, as formerly!—Adieu, my angel! I send you the softest kisses of\r\nlove.\r\n\r\nP. S. Poor Prevan, at the end of his month’s imprisonment, was obliged\r\nto quit his corps; it is public all over Paris. Upon my word he is\r\ncruelly treated, and your success is complete.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Oct._ 29, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Letters cxx and cxxii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXVI.\r\n\r\nMadame de Rosemonde _to the_ Presidente de Tourvel.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would have answered your letter sooner, my dear child, if the fatigue\r\nof my last had not brought on a return of my disorder, which has\r\ndeprived me ever since of the use of my arm. I was very anxious to\r\nthank you for the good news you gave me of my nephew, and not less to\r\ncongratulate you sincerely on your own account. Here the interposition\r\nof Providence is visible, that touching the heart of the one has also\r\nsaved the other. Yes, my lovely dear! the Almighty, who sent you this\r\ntrial, has assisted you in the moment your strength was exhausted; and\r\nnotwithstanding your little murmurings, I think you have great reason\r\nto return him your unfeigned thanks: not but I believe you would have\r\nbeen very glad to have been the first in this resolution, and that\r\nValmont’s should have been the consequence of it; I even think, humanly\r\nspeaking, the dignity of our sex would have been better preserved, and\r\nwe are not fond of giving up any of our rights. But what are these\r\nconsiderations to those more important objects! We seldom hear a person\r\nsaved from shipwreck complain, the means were not in his option.\r\n\r\nYou will soon experience, my dear child, the afflictions you dreaded\r\nso much will grow lighter of themselves, and even were they to last\r\nfor ever in their full force, you will be sensible they are easier to\r\nbear than the remorse of guilt or self-contempt. It would have been\r\nuseless to talk to you before with this apparent severity: love is\r\nan independent passion, that prudence may make us avoid, but cannot\r\nconquer, which when once it has taken root, must die its own natural\r\ndeath, or of absolute despair. This last being your case, gives me the\r\nresolution and the right to tell you freely my sentiments. It is cruel\r\nto frighten a sick person that is despaired of, to whom palliatives\r\nonly and consolations should be administered: but it is the part of\r\nwisdom to remind those on the recovery, of the dangers they escaped,\r\nto assist them with necessary prudence and submission to the advice\r\nthey stand in need of. As you have chose me for your physician, in that\r\ncharacter I address you, and tell you, the little inconveniencies you\r\nfeel at present, which may require, perhaps, some remedies, are nothing\r\nin comparison of the dreadful disorder whose cure is now certain.\r\nThen, as your friend, as the friend of a virtuous and reasonable woman,\r\ngive me leave to add, this passion you have subdued, so unhappy in\r\nitself, became infinitely more so in its object. If I am to believe\r\nwhat I am told, my nephew, who I must own I love even to a degree of\r\nweakness, unites many laudable qualities to a great many attractions,\r\nis very dangerous to the women, blameable in his behaviour towards\r\nthem, and piques himself as much on exposing as seducing them. I really\r\nbelieve you would have converted him. Sure never was any one so worthy;\r\nhowever, so many others flattered themselves in the same manner, whose\r\nhopes were frustrated, that I am overjoyed to find you are not reduced\r\nto that resource.\r\n\r\nReflect now, my dear woman, that instead of so many dangers as you\r\nwould have had to go through, you will have, besides the testimony of\r\na good conscience and your own peace, the satisfaction of being the\r\ncause of Valmont’s reformation. I own, I think it in a great measure\r\nowing to your resolute defence, and that a moment’s weakness on your\r\npart would have left my nephew in lasting disorders. I love to indulge\r\nthis way of thinking, and wish you to do the same; you will find it\r\nconsoling; it will be an additional reason for me to love you the more.\r\n\r\nI shall expect you in a few days, my dear child, as you promised. You\r\nwill once more find serenity and happiness where you lost them. Come\r\nand rejoice with your tender mother, that you have so happily kept your\r\nword to do nothing unworthy yourself or her.\r\n\r\n_Castle of_ ——, _Oct._ 30, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXVII.\r\n\r\n_The_ Marchioness de Merteuil _to the_ Viscount de Valmont.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not for want of time, that I did not answer your letter of the\r\n19th, Viscount, but plainly because it put me out of temper, and did\r\nnot contain a single syllable of common sense. I thought it then the\r\nbest way to leave it in oblivion—but since you seem fond of this\r\nproduction, and the sublime ideas it contains, that you construe my\r\nsilence into consent, it is necessary you should have my opinion\r\nexplicitly.\r\n\r\nI may have heretofore formed the design of singly performing the\r\nfunctions of a whole seraglio; but it never entered my head to become\r\nonly a part of one; this I thought you knew, now, that you cannot plead\r\nignorance, you may readily conceive how ridiculous your proposition\r\nmust appear to me. Should I sacrifice an inclination, and a new one,\r\nfor you? And in what manner, pray? Why, waiting for my turn, like a\r\nsubmissive slave, the sublime favours of your _highness_. When, for\r\nexample, you was inclined to relax for a moment from _that unknown\r\ncharm_ that the _adorable, the celestial_ M. de Tourvel only had made\r\nyou feel;—or when you dread to risk with the _engaging Cecilia_, the\r\nsuperior idea you wished her to preserve for you;—then condescending\r\nto stoop to me, you will seek pleasures less violent, but of not much\r\nconsequence, and your inestimable bounty, though scarce, must fill the\r\nmeasure of my felicity. Certainly you stand high in your own opinion;\r\nand my modesty nor my glass have yet prevailed on me to think I am\r\nsunk so low. This may be owing to my wrong way of thinking; but I beg\r\nyou will be persuaded I have more imaginations of the same kind.\r\n\r\nOne especially, which is, that _Danceny, the school-boy, the whiner,_\r\ntotally taken up with me, sacrificing, without making a merit of it,\r\nhis first love, even before it was enjoyed, and loving me to that\r\nexcess that is usual with those at his age, may contribute more to my\r\nhappiness and pleasure than you—I will even take the liberty to add,\r\nthat if I had the inclination to give him a partner, it should not be\r\nyou, at least now.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you’ll ask me why? Probably I should be at a loss for a\r\nreason; for the same whim that would give you the preference, might\r\nalso exclude you. However, politeness requires I should inform you of\r\nmy motive—I think you must make too many sacrifices; and instead of\r\nbeing grateful, as you certainly would expect, I should be inclined\r\nto think you still owed me more—You must therefore be sensible, our\r\nmanner of thinking being so opposite, we can by no means unite: I fear\r\nit will be some time, nay a great while, before I change my opinion.\r\n\r\nWhen that happens, I promise to give you notice:—Until then, let me\r\nadvise you to take some other measures, and keep your kisses for those\r\nto whom they will be more agreeable.\r\n\r\nYou say _adieu, as formerly!_ but formerly, if I remember, you\r\nset a greater value on me than to appoint me entirely to the\r\nthird characters; and was content to wait until I answered in the\r\naffirmative, before you was certain of my consent: don’t be angry\r\nthen, if instead of saying adieu, as formerly, I say adieu, as at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nYour servant, Viscount.\r\n\r\n_The castle of_ ——, _Oct._ 31, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXVIII.\r\n\r\n_The_ Presidente de Tourvel _to_ Madame de Rosemonde.\r\n\r\n\r\nI did not receive, until yesterday, Madam, your dilatory answer—it\r\nwould instantly have put an end to my existence if I had any left; but\r\nM. de Valmont is now in possession of it: you see I do not conceal any\r\nthing from you; if you no longer think me worthy your friendship, I\r\ndread the loss of it less than to impose on you; to tell you all in\r\nall, I was placed by M. de Valmont, between his death and happiness—I\r\nchose the latter—I neither boast nor accuse myself; I relate the fact\r\nplainly as it is.\r\n\r\nYou will readily perceive, after this, what kind of impression your\r\nletter, and the truths it contains, must have made on me. Do not,\r\nhowever, imagine, it could give birth to any repining, or ever make\r\nme alter my sentiments or conduct; not that I am exempt from some\r\ntorturing moments; but when my heart is rent, and I dread not being any\r\nlonger able to bear my torments, I say to myself, Valmont is happy; and\r\nat this idea my miseries vanish; all is converted into joy.\r\n\r\nIt is to your nephew, then, I have devoted myself; it is for his sake\r\nI am undone; he is now the centre of my thoughts, sentiments, and\r\nactions. Whilst my life can contribute to his happiness, I shall\r\ncherish it; I shall think it fortunate; if he should hereafter think\r\notherwise, he shall never hear from me either complaint or reproach.\r\nI have already ventured to fix my eyes on this fatal period, and my\r\nresolution is taken.\r\n\r\nYou will now perceive how little I am affected with the dread you\r\nseem to entertain, that M. de Valmont, will one day or other defame\r\nme—Before that happens, he must lose the affection he has for me; that\r\nonce lost, of what signification will vain reproaches be which I shall\r\nnever hear? He alone will judge me, as I will have lived for him, and\r\nhim only; and my memory will repose in him; and if he will be obliged\r\nto acknowledge I loved him, I shall be justified sufficiently.\r\n\r\nNow, Madam, you read my heart—I preferred the misfortune of being\r\ndeprived of your esteem by my candour, to that of making myself\r\nunworthy of it by the baseness of a lie. I thought I owed this entire\r\nconfidence to your former goodness; the addition of a word would,\r\nperhaps, give room to suspect I should be vain enough yet to depend on\r\nit; far from it: I will do myself justice, by giving up all pretensions\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nI am with great respect, Madam, your most humble and most obedient\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Nov._ 1, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXIX.\r\n\r\nViscount de Valmont _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhence arises, my charming friend, this strain of acrimony and ridicule\r\nwhich runs through your last letter? What crime have I unintentionally\r\ncommitted which puts you so much out of temper? You reproach me with\r\npresuming on your consent before I had obtained it—I imagined,\r\nhowever, what might appear like presumption in any one else, would,\r\nbetween you and me, be only the effect of confidence. I would be glad\r\nto know how long has this sentiment been detrimental to friendship or\r\nlove? Uniting hope with desire, I only complied with that natural\r\nimpulse, which makes us wish to draw as near as possible to the\r\nhappiness we are in pursuit of—and you have mistaken that for vanity,\r\nwhich is nothing more than ardour. I know very well, in such cases,\r\ncustom has introduced a respectful apprehension; but you also know,\r\nit is only a kind of form, a mere precedent; and I imagined myself\r\nauthorised to believe those trifling niceties no longer necessary\r\nbetween us.\r\n\r\nI even think this free and open method much preferable to insipid\r\nflattery, which so often love nauseates, when it is grounded on an\r\nold connection. Moreover, perhaps the preference I give this method\r\nproceeds from the happiness it recalls to my memory—this gives me\r\nmore uneasiness that you should take it in another light. However,\r\nthis is the only thing that I am culpable in—for I cannot believe\r\nyou can seriously imagine, that the woman exists who I would prefer to\r\nyou; and still less, that I should estimate you so little as you feign\r\nto believe. You say, you have consulted your glass on this occasion,\r\nand you do not find yourself sunk so low—I believe it; and that only\r\nproves your glass to be true—but should you not rather from thence\r\nconcluded that certainly that was not my opinion.\r\n\r\nIn vain I seek the cause of this strange idea—however, I suspect it\r\nis more or less dependent on the praises I lavished on other women—at\r\nleast, this I infer, from the affectation of quoting the epithets,\r\n_adorable, celestial, attaching,_ which I used, speaking of Madam de\r\nTourvel, and the little Volanges: but you are not to be told, those\r\nwords, which are oftener the effect of chance than reflection, express\r\nmore the situation one happens to be in at the time, than the value\r\none sets upon the person. If at the time I was affected with the one or\r\nthe other, I nevertheless rapturously wished for you—If I gave you an\r\neminent preference over both, as I would not renew our first connection\r\nwithout breaking off the two others, I do not think there is such great\r\nreason for reproaches.\r\n\r\nI shall not find it more difficult to exculpate myself from the charge\r\nof the _unknown charm_, which, it seems, shocks you not a little; for\r\nbeing unknown, it does not follow that it is stronger—What can equal\r\nthe delights you alone can always embellish with novelty and bliss?\r\nI only wished to convey to you an idea, it was a kind I never before\r\nexperienced; but without pretending to give it any rank; and added,\r\nwhat I again repeat, whatever it be, I will overcome it: and shall\r\nexert myself more zealously if I can in this trifling affair, to have\r\none homage more to offer to you.\r\n\r\nAs to the little Cecilia, it is useless to mention her: you have not\r\nforgot it was at your instance I took charge of this child; and only\r\nwait your orders to be rid of her. I may have made some remarks on her\r\nbloom and innocence; and for a moment thought her _engaging_, because\r\none is always more or less pleased with their work; but she has not, in\r\nany shape, consistency to fix the attention.\r\n\r\nNow, my lovely friend, I appeal to your justice, your first attachment\r\nto me, the long and sincere friendship, the unbounded confidence which\r\nhave linked us together—have I deserved the severe manner in which you\r\nhave treated me? But how easy can you make me amends when you please!\r\nSpeak but the word, and you will see whether all the charms, all the\r\nattachments will keep me here, not a day, but even a minute; I will fly\r\nto your feet—into your arms—and will prove a thousand times, and in a\r\nthousand ways, that you are, you ever will be, the only mistress of my\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my lovely friend! I wait your answer impatiently.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Nov._ 3, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXX.\r\n\r\nMadame de Rosemonde, _to the_ Presidente de Tourvel.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy, my lovely dear, will you no longer be my daughter? Why do you seem\r\nto announce that our correspondence is to cease?[1] Is it to punish\r\nme for not guessing at what was improbable; or do you suspect me of\r\ncreating you affliction designedly? I know your heart too well, to\r\nimagine you would entertain such an opinion of mine.—The distress your\r\nletter plunges me in is much less on my own account than yours. Oh!\r\nmy young friend, with grief I tell you, you are too worthy of being\r\nbeloved ever to be happy in love—Where is there a truly delicate and\r\nsensible woman, who has not met unhappiness where she expected bliss?\r\nDo men know how to rate the women they possess?\r\n\r\nNot but many of them are virtuous in their addresses and constant\r\nin their affections—but even among those, how few that know how\r\nto put themselves in unison with our hearts. I do not imagine, my\r\ndear child, their affection is like ours—They experience the same\r\ntransport often with more violence, but they are strangers to that\r\nuneasy officiousness, that delicate solicitude, that produces in us\r\nthose continual tender cares, whose sole aim is the beloved object—Man\r\nenjoys the happiness he feels, woman that she gives.\r\n\r\nThis difference, so essential, and so seldom observed, influences in a\r\nvery sensible manner, the totality of their respective conduct. The\r\npleasure of the one is to gratify desires; but that of the other is to\r\ncreate them. To know to please, is in man the means of success; and in\r\nwoman it is success itself.\r\n\r\nAnd do not imagine, the exceptions, be they more or less numerous, that\r\nmay be quoted, can be successfully opposed to those general truths,\r\nwhich the voice of the public has guaranteed, with the only distinction\r\nas to men of infidelity from inconstancy; a distinction of which they\r\navail themselves, and of which they should be ashamed; which never\r\nhas been adopted by any of our sex but those of abandoned characters,\r\nwho are a scandal to us, and to whom all methods are acceptable which\r\nthey think may deliver them from the painful sensation of their own\r\nmeanness.\r\n\r\nI thought, my lovely dear, those reflections might be of use to you, in\r\norder to oppose the chimerical ideas of perfect happiness, with which\r\nlove never fails to amuse our imagination. Deceitful hope! to which we\r\nare still attached, even when we find ourselves under the necessity of\r\nabandoning it—whose loss multiplies and irritates our already too real\r\nsorrows, inseparable from an ardent passion—This task of alleviating\r\nyour troubles, or diminishing their number, is the only one I will or\r\ncan now fulfil—In disorders which are without remedy, no other advice\r\ncan be given, than as to the regimen to be observed—The only thing I\r\nwish you to remember is, that to pity is not to blame a patient. Alas!\r\nwho are we, that we dare blame one another? Let us leave the right of\r\njudging to the searcher of hearts; and I will even venture to believe,\r\nthat in his paternal sight, a crowd of virtues, may compensate a\r\nsingle weakness.\r\n\r\nBut I conjure you above all things, my dear friend, to guard against\r\nviolent resolutions, which are less the effects of fortitude than\r\ndespondency: do not forget, that although you have made another\r\npossessor of your existence (to use your own expression) you had it not\r\nin your power to deprive your friends of the share they were before\r\npossessed of, and which they will always claim.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear child! Think sometimes on your tender mother; and be\r\nassured you always will be, above every thing, the dearest object of\r\nher thoughts.\r\n\r\n_Castle of_ ——, _Nov._ 4, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See Letter cxxviii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXI.\r\n\r\n_The_ Marchioness de Merteuil _to the_ Viscount de Valmont.\r\n\r\n\r\nVery well, Viscount; come, I am better pleased with you than I was\r\nbefore: now let us converse in a friendly manner, and I hope to\r\nconvince you, the scheme you propose would be the highest act of folly\r\nin us both.\r\n\r\nHave you never observed that pleasure, which is the _primum mobile_ of\r\nthe union of the sexes, is not sufficient to form a connection between\r\nthem? and that if desire, which brings them together, precedes it,\r\nit is nevertheless followed by disgust, which repels it—This is a\r\nlaw of nature, that love alone can alter; and pray, can we have this\r\nsame love at will? It is then necessary it should be always ready,\r\nwhich would have been very troublesome had it not been discovered, it\r\nis sufficient if it exists on one side: by this means the difficulty\r\nis lessened by half, even without apparent prejudice; for the one\r\nenjoys the happiness of loving, the other of pleasing—not perhaps in\r\naltogether so lively a manner, but that is compensated by deceit, which\r\nmakes the balance, and then all is right.\r\n\r\nBut say, Viscount, which of us two will undertake to deceive the other?\r\nYou know the story of the two sharpers who discovered each other at\r\nplay—“We must not prejudice ourselves,” said they; “let us club for\r\nthe cards, and leave off.” Let us follow this prudent advice, nor lose\r\ntime together, which we may so usefully employ elsewhere.\r\n\r\nTo convince you that I consult your interest as much as my own, and\r\nthat I am not actuated either by ill humour or capriciousness, I\r\nwill not refuse your reward—I am very sensible one night will be\r\nsufficient; and do not in the least doubt, we shall know how to make it\r\nso pleasing, the morning will come with regret—but let us not forget,\r\nthis regret is necessary to happiness; although the illusion may be\r\nenchanting, nor flatter ourselves it can be durable.\r\n\r\nYou see I fulfil my promise in my turn, and even before you perform the\r\nconditions stipulated—for I was to have had your celestial prude’s\r\nfirst letter. Whether you do not choose to part with it, or that you\r\nhave forgot the conditions of a bargain that is not so interesting to\r\nyou as you would have me think, I have not received any thing; and I am\r\nmuch mistaken, or the tender devotee must have wrote a great deal; for\r\nhow can she employ her time alone? she certainly has not sense enough\r\nfor dissipation? If I was inclined, then, I have room to make you some\r\nlittle reproaches, which I shall pass over in silence, in consideration\r\nof the petulance I perhaps showed in my last letter.\r\n\r\nNothing more remains, now, Viscount, but to make you a request, and it\r\nis as much for you as myself; that is, to defer the time, which perhaps\r\nI wish for as much as you, but which I think may be put off until my\r\nreturn to town. On the one hand, it would be very inconvenient here;\r\nand on the other, it would be running too great a risk; for a little\r\njealousy would fix me with the dismal Belleroche, who no longer holds\r\nbut by a thread. He is already struggling to love me; we are at present\r\nso critically circumstanced, I blend as much malice as prudence in the\r\ncaresses I lavish on him; at the same time you will observe, it would\r\nnot be a sacrifice worthy of you—A reciprocal infidelity will add\r\npower to the charm.\r\n\r\nDo you know I regret sometimes we are reduced to those resources—At\r\nthe time we loved each other, for I believe it was love, I was\r\nhappy—and you, Viscount—but why engage our thoughts on a happiness\r\nthat can never return? No, say what you will, it is impossible—First,\r\nI should require sacrifices that you could not or would not make; that\r\nprobably I do not deserve. Again, how is it possible to fix you? Oh,\r\nno; I will not even think of it; and notwithstanding the pleasure I now\r\nhave in writing to you, I prefer quitting you abruptly. Adieu, Viscount.\r\n\r\n_Castle of_ ——, _Nov._ 6, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXII.\r\n\r\n_The_ Presidente de Tourvel _to_ Madame de Rosemonde.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeeply impressed, Madam, with your goodness, to which I would entirely\r\nabandon myself, if I was not restrained from accepting by the dread\r\nof profaning it. Why, convinced of its inestimable value, must I know\r\nmyself no longer worthy of it? Let me, at least, attempt to testify my\r\ngratitude. I shall admire, above all, the lenity of virtue, which views\r\nweakness with the eye of compassion; whose powerful charm preserves its\r\nforcible but mild authority over hearts, even by the side of the charm\r\nof love.\r\n\r\nCan I still be worthy a friendship, which is no longer useful to my\r\nhappiness? I must say the same of your advice. I feel its force, but\r\ncannot follow it. How is it possible to discredit perfect happiness,\r\nwhen I experience it this moment? If men are such as you describe them,\r\nthey must be shunned, they are hateful: but where is the resemblance\r\nbetween Valmont and them? If, in common with them, he has that violence\r\nof passion you call transport, is it not restrained by delicacy? My\r\ndear friend, you talk of sharing my troubles; take a part, then, in\r\nmy happiness; to love I am indebted for it, and how immensely does\r\nthe object raise its value! You love your nephew, you say, perhaps,\r\nwith fondness: ah! if you knew him as I do, you would idolize him, and\r\nyet even less than he deserves. He has undoubtedly been led astray\r\nby some errors; he does not conceal it; but who like him ever knew\r\nwhat was love? What can I say more? He feels it as he inspires it. You\r\nwill think this is _one of the chimerical ideas with which love never\r\nfails to abuse our imagination:_ but in my case, why should he be more\r\ntender, more earnest, when he has nothing farther to obtain? I will\r\nown, I formerly thought I observed an air of reflection and reserve,\r\nwhich seldom left him, and which often, contrary to my inclination,\r\nrecalled to me the false and cruel impressions that were given me of\r\nhim; but since he has abandoned himself without constraint to the\r\nemotions of his heart, he seems to guess at all my desires. Who knows\r\nbut we were born for each other? If this happiness was not reserved\r\nfor me to be necessary to his!—Ah! if it be an illusion, let me die\r\nbefore it ends.—No, I must live to cherish, to adore him. Why should\r\nhe cease loving me? What woman on earth could he make happier than me?\r\nAnd I experience it by myself, this happiness that he has given rise\r\nto, is the only and the strongest tie. It is this delicious sentiment\r\nthat exalts and purifies love, and becomes truly worthy a tender and\r\ngenerous mind, such as Valmont’s.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear, my respectable, my indulgent friend! Vainly should\r\nI think of continuing my letter. This is the hour he promised to\r\ncome, and every idea flies before him. Your pardon. But you wish me\r\nhappiness; it is now so great I can scarce support it.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Nov._ 7, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXIII.\r\n\r\n_The_ Viscount de Valmont _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat, then, my charming friend, are those sacrifices you think I would\r\nnot make to your pleasure? Let me only know them; and if I hesitate to\r\noffer them to you, I give you leave to refuse the homage. What opinion\r\nhave you of late conceived of me, when even favourably inclined, you\r\ndoubt my sentiments or inclinations? Sacrifices that I would not or\r\ncould not make! So you think I am in love, subdued! The value I set on\r\nthe success, you suspect is attached to the person. Ah! thank heaven, I\r\nam not yet reduced to that, and I offer to prove it. I will prove it,\r\nif even it should be at Madame de Tourvel’s expence. Certainly after\r\nthat you cannot have a doubt remaining.\r\n\r\nI may, I believe, without committing myself, give up some time to a\r\nwoman, who, at least, has the merit of being of a cast rarely met. The\r\ndead season, perhaps, when this adventure took its rise, was another\r\nreason to give myself totally up to it; even now that the grand current\r\nof company scarcely begins to flow, it is not surprising my time is\r\nalmost entirely taken up with her. I beg you will also recollect, it\r\nis scarce eight days I enjoy the fruits of three months labour. I have\r\noften indulged longer with what has not been so valuable, and had not\r\ncost me so much; and yet you never from thence drew any conclusions\r\nagainst me.\r\n\r\nShall I tell you the real cause of my assiduity? It is this. She is\r\nnaturally of a timid disposition; at first she doubted incessantly of\r\nher happiness, which was sufficient to disturb it; so that I but just\r\nbegin to observe how far my power extends in this kind. This I was\r\ncurious to know, and the occasions are not so readily offered as one\r\nmay think.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, pleasure is nothing but mere pleasure with a great\r\nnumber of women, and never any thing else; with them, whatever titles\r\nthey think proper to adorn us with, we are never but factors, simple\r\ncommissioners, whose activity is all their merit, and among whom he who\r\nperforms most is always esteemed the best.\r\n\r\nIn another class, the most numerous now-a-days, the celebrity of the\r\nlover, the pleasure of carrying him from a rival, the dread of a\r\nreprisal again, totally engage the women. Thus we are concerned more or\r\nless in this kind of happiness which they enjoy; but it depends more\r\non circumstances than on the person: it comes to them by us, and not\r\nfrom us.\r\n\r\nIt was then necessary to find a woman of delicacy and sensation to make\r\nmy observations on, whose sole concern should be love, and in that\r\npassion be absorbed by the lover; whose emotions, disdaining the common\r\ntrack, should fly from the heart to the senses; who I have viewed, (I\r\ndon’t mean the first day) rise from the bed of delight all in tears,\r\nand the instant after recover voluptuousness by a word that touched her\r\nsoul. She must also have united that natural candour, which habitude\r\nhad made insurmountable, and would not suffer her to dissemble the\r\nleast sentiment of her heart. You must agree with me, such women are\r\nscarce; and I am confident, if I had not met this one, I never should\r\nhave found another.\r\n\r\nTherefore it is not at all surprising she should have fascinated me\r\nlonger than another; and if the time I spend makes her happy, perfectly\r\nhappy, why should I refuse it, especially when it is so agreeable\r\nto me? But because the mind is engaged, must the heart be enslaved?\r\nCertainly not. And the value I set on this adventure will not prevent\r\nmy engaging in others, or even sacrificing this to some more agreeable\r\none.\r\n\r\nI am even so much at liberty, that I have not neglected the little\r\nVolanges, to whom I am so little attached. Her mother brings her\r\nto town in three days, and I have secured my communication since\r\nyesterday; a little money to the porter, a few soft speeches to the\r\nwaiting maid, did the business. Would you believe it? Danceny never\r\nthought of this simple method. Where, then, is the boasted ingenuity\r\nof love? Quite the contrary; it stupifies its votaries. Shall I not,\r\nthen, know how to preserve myself from it? Be not uneasy, in a few days\r\nI shall divide the impression, perhaps rather too strong, it made on\r\nme, and weaken it; if one will not do, I will increase them.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I shall be ready to give up the young pensioner to her\r\ndiscreet lover, when you think proper. I can’t see you have any longer\r\nreason to oppose it. I freely consent to render poor Danceny this\r\nsignal service: upon my word, it is but trifling, for all those he has\r\ndone for me. He is now in the greatest anxiety to know whether he will\r\nbe admitted at Madame de Volanges’s. I keep him as easy as possible,\r\nby promising some how or other to gratify him one of those days; in\r\nthe mean time, I take upon me to carry on the correspondence, which he\r\nintends to resume on his Cecilia’s arrival. I have already six of his\r\nletters, and shall have one or two more before the happy day. This lad\r\nmust have very little to do.\r\n\r\nHowever, let us leave this childish couple, and come to our own\r\nbusiness, that I may be entirely engaged with the pleasing hope your\r\nletter has given me. Do you doubt of fixing me yours? If you do, I\r\nshall not forgive you. Have I ever been inconstant? Our bands have been\r\nloosened, but never broken; our pretended rupture was an error only of\r\nthe imagination; our sentiments, our interests, are still the same.\r\nLike the traveller who returned undeceived, I found out, as he did, I\r\nquitted happiness to run after hope.[1] The more strange lands I saw,\r\nthe more I I loved my country. No longer oppose the idea, or sentiment\r\nrather, that brings you back to me. After having tried all manner of\r\npleasures in our different excursions, let us sit down and enjoy the\r\nhappiness of knowing, that none is equal to what we have experienced,\r\nand that we shall again find more delicious.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my lovely friend! I consent to wait your return; however, hasten\r\nit as much as possible, and do not forget how much I wish for it.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Nov._ 8, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Du Belloi’s tragedy of the Siege of Calais.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXIV.\r\n\r\nMarchioness de Merteuil _to the_ Viscount de Valmont.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon my word, Viscount, you are exactly like the children, before\r\nwhom one cannot speak a word, nor show a thing but they must have it\r\nimmediately. Because I just mention an idea that came into my head,\r\nwhich I even told you I was not fixed on, you abuse my intention, and\r\nwant to tie me down, at the time I endeavour to forget it, and force\r\nme in a manner to share your thoughtless desires. Are you not very\r\nungenerous to make me bear the whole burthen of prudential care? I must\r\nagain repeat, and it frequently occurs to me, the method you propose\r\nis impossible. When you would even throw in all the generosity you\r\nmention, do you imagine I am divested of my delicacies, and I would\r\naccept sacrifices prejudicial to your happiness?\r\n\r\nMy dear Viscount, you certainly deceive yourself in the sentiment that\r\nattaches you to M. de Tourvel. It is love, or such a passion never\r\nhad existence. You deny it in a hundred shapes; but you prove it in\r\na thousand. What means, for example, the subterfuge you use against\r\nyourself, for I believe you sincere with me, that makes you relate\r\nso circumstantially the desire you can neither conceal nor combat, of\r\nkeeping this woman? Would not one imagine, you never had made any other\r\nhappy, perfectly happy? Ah! if you doubt it, your memory is very bad:\r\nbut that is not the case. To speak plainly, your heart imposes on your\r\nunderstanding, and pays it off with bad arguments: but I, who am so\r\nstrongly interested not to be deceived, am not so easily blinded.\r\n\r\nThus, as I remarked, your politeness made you carefully suppress every\r\nword you thought would displease me, I could not help observing,\r\nperhaps, without taking notice of it; nevertheless you preserved the\r\nsame ideas. It is no longer the adorable, the celestial Madame de\r\nTourvel, but _an astonishing woman, a delicate sentimental woman,_ even\r\nto the exclusion of all others; _a wonderful woman_, such _as a second\r\ncould not be found._ The same way with your unknown charm, which is not\r\n_the strongest_. Well; be it so: but since you never found it out till\r\nthen, it is much to be apprehended you will never meet it again; the\r\nloss would be irreparable. Those, Viscount, are sure symptoms of love,\r\nor we must renounce the hope of ever finding it. You may be assured I\r\nam not out of temper now; and have made a promise, I will not be so any\r\nmore: I foresee it might become a dangerous snare. Take my word for\r\nit, we had better remain as we are, in friendship. Be thankful for my\r\nresolution in defending myself; for sometimes one must have it, not to\r\ntake a step that may be attended with bad consequences.\r\n\r\nIt is only to persuade you to be of my opinion, I answer the demand\r\nyou make, on the sacrifices I would exact, and you could not make.\r\nI designedly use the word exact, because immediately you will think\r\nme too exacting—so much the better: far from being angry with your\r\nrefusal, I shall thank you for it. Observe, I will not dissemble with\r\nyou; perhaps I have occasion for it.\r\n\r\nFirst I would exact—take notice of the cruelty! that this same rare,\r\nthis astonishing Madame de Tourvel, should be no more to you than\r\nany other woman; that is, a mere woman: for you must not deceive\r\nyourself; this charm, that you believe is found in others, exists in\r\nus, and it is love only embellishes the beloved object so much. What\r\nI now require, although so impossible for you to grant, you would not\r\nhesitate to promise, nay, even to swear; but I own I would not believe\r\nyou the more. I could not be convinced, but by the whole tenor of your\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nThat is not all; I should be whimsical, perhaps; the sacrifice you\r\nso politely offer me of the little Cecilia, does not give me the\r\nleast uneasiness: on the contrary, I should require you to continue\r\nthis toilsome duty until farther orders. Whether I should like thus\r\nto abuse my power, or whether more indulgent, or more reasonable, it\r\nwould satisfy me to dispose of your sentiments without thwarting your\r\npleasures. I would, however, be obeyed, and my commands would be very\r\nsevere.\r\n\r\nCertainly I should think myself obliged to thank you, and, who knows?\r\nperhaps to reward you. As for instance, I might shorten an absence,\r\nwhich would be insupportable to me. I should at length see you\r\nagain, Viscount; and see you again—How?—Remember this is only a\r\nconversation, a plain narrative of an impossible scheme. I must not be\r\nthe only one to forget it.\r\n\r\nI must tell you my lawsuit begins to make me a little uneasy. I was\r\ndetermined to know exactly what my pretensions were. My lawyers have\r\nquoted me some laws, and a great many _authorities_, as they call them;\r\nbut I can’t perceive so much reason and justice in them. I am almost\r\nafraid I did wrong to refuse the compromise; however, I begin to be\r\nencouraged, when I consider my attorney is skilful, my lawyer eloquent,\r\nand the plaintiff handsome. If those reasons were to be no longer\r\nvalid, the course of business must be altered; then what would become\r\nof the respect for old customs? This lawsuit is actually the only thing\r\nkeeps me here. That of Belleroche is finished; the indictment quashed,\r\neach party to bear their own costs: he even is regretting not to be at\r\nthe ball to-night; the regret of a man out of employment. I shall let\r\nhim free at my return to town. In making this grievous sacrifice, I am\r\nconsoled by the generosity he finds in it.\r\n\r\nAdieu, Viscount! write to me often. The particulars of your amusements\r\nwill make me amends partly for the dulness I suffer.\r\n\r\n_Castle of_ ——, _Nov._ 11, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXV.\r\n\r\n_The_ Presidente de Tourvel _to_ Madame de Rosemonde.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am now endeavouring to write to you, and know not whether I shall be\r\nable. Gracious God!—excessive happiness prevented my continuing my\r\nlast letter; now despair overwhelms me, and leaves me only strength\r\nsufficient to tell my sorrows, and deprives me of the power of\r\nexpressing them.—Valmont—Valmont no longer loves me! He never loved\r\nme! Love does not depart thus. He deceived me, he betrayed me, he\r\ninsults me! I suffer every kind of misfortune and humiliation; and all\r\nproceed from him.\r\n\r\nDo not think it a mere suspicion. I was far from having any. I have\r\nnot even the consolation of a doubt: I saw it. What can he say in his\r\njustification?—But what matters it to him? He will not attempt it\r\neven.—Unhappy wretch! What avail thy reproaches and thy tears? He is\r\nnot concerned about thee.\r\n\r\nIt is, then, too true, he has made me a sacrifice; he has even exposed\r\nme—and to whom?—To a vile creature.—But what do I say? Ah! I have no\r\nright to despise her. She has not broke through any ties; she is not\r\nso culpable as I am. Oh! what grief can equal that which is followed by\r\nremorse! I feel my torments increase. Adieu, my dear friend! though I\r\nam unworthy your compassion, still you will have some left for me, if\r\nyou can form an idea of my sufferings.\r\n\r\nI have just read over my letter, and perceive it gives you no\r\ninformation. I will endeavour to muster up resolution to relate this\r\ncruel event. It was yesterday, I was to sup abroad for the first time\r\nsince my return. Valmont came to me at five; he never appeared so\r\nendearing: he did not seem pleased with my intention of going abroad; I\r\nimmediately resolved to stay at home. In two hours after, his air and\r\ntone changed visibly on a sudden. I don’t know any thing escaped me to\r\ndisplease him; however, he pretended to recollect business that obliged\r\nhim to leave me, and went away; not without expressing a tender\r\nconcern, which I then thought very sincere.\r\n\r\nBeing left alone, I resolved to fulfil my first engagement, as I was at\r\nliberty. I finished my toilet, and got in my carriage. Unfortunately my\r\ncoachman drove by the opera, and my carriage was stopped in the crowd\r\ncoming up. I perceived at a little distance before mine, and the range\r\nnext to me, Valmont’s carriage: my heart instantly palpitated, but not\r\nwith fear; and my only wish was, that my carriage should get forward:\r\ninstead of which, his was obliged to back close to mine. I immediately\r\nlooked out; but what was my astonishment to see beside him a well-known\r\ncourtezan! I drew back, as you may believe; I had seen enough to wound\r\nmy heart: but what you will scarcely credit is, this same girl, being\r\nprobably in his confidence, did not turn her eyes from me, and with\r\nrepeated peals of laughter stared me out of countenance.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding my abject state, I suffered myself to be carried to the\r\nhouse where I was to sup. I found it impossible to stay there long;\r\nevery instant I was ready to faint, and could not refrain from tears.\r\n\r\nAt my return I wrote to M. de Valmont, and sent my letter immediately;\r\nhe was not at home. Being determined at all events to be relieved\r\nfrom this miserable state, or have it confirmed for ever, I sent the\r\nservant back, with orders to wait: before twelve he came home, telling\r\nme the coachman was returned, and had informed him, his master would\r\nnot be home for the night. This morning I thought it would be better\r\nto request he would give up my letters, and beg of him never to see\r\nme more. I have given orders accordingly, but certainly they were\r\nuseless. It is now near twelve; he has not yet appeared, nor have I\r\nreceived a line from him.\r\n\r\nNow, my dear friend, I have nothing farther to add. You are informed of\r\nevery thing, and you know my heart. My only hope is, I shall not long\r\ntrouble your tender friendship.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Nov._ 15, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXVI.\r\n\r\n_The_ Presidente de Tourvel _to the_ Viscount de Valmont.\r\n\r\n\r\nCertainly, Sir, after what passed yesterday, you do not expect I should\r\nsee you again, and you as certainly do not desire it. The intention\r\nof this note, then, is not so much to require you never to come near\r\nme more, as to call on you for my letters, which ought not to have\r\nexisted. If they could at any time have been interesting, as proofs\r\nof the infatuation you had occasioned, they must be, now that is\r\ndissipated, indifferent to you, as they were only proofs of a sentiment\r\nyou have destroyed.\r\n\r\nI own, I was very wrong in placing a confidence in you, of which so\r\nmany before me have been victims; I accuse no one but myself: but I\r\nnever thought I deserved to be exposed by you to contempt and insult.\r\nI imagined, that making a sacrifice of every thing, and giving up for\r\nyou my pretensions to the esteem of others, as also my own, I might\r\nhave expected not to be treated by you with more severity than by the\r\npublic, whose opinion always makes an immense difference between the\r\nweak and the depraved. Those are the only wrongs I shall mention. I\r\nshall be silent on those of love, as your heart would not understand\r\nmine. Farewell, Sir!\r\n\r\n_Paris, Nov._ 15, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXVII.\r\n\r\nViscount de Valmont _to the_ Presidente de Tourvel.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis instant only have I received your letter, Madam. I could not read\r\nit without shuddering, and have scarcely strength to answer it. What a\r\nhorrible opinion have you, then, conceived of me! Doubtless, I have my\r\nfaults, and such as I shall never forgive myself, if even you should\r\nhide them with your indulgence. But how distant from my thoughts are\r\nthose you reproach me! Who, me insult you! Me make you contemptible,\r\nat a time when I reverence as much as cherish you! when you raised my\r\nvanity by thinking me worthy of you! Appearances have deceived you. I\r\nwill not deny they make against me: but had you not sufficient within\r\nyour own heart to contend against them? Did it not revolt at the idea\r\nof having a cause of complaint against me? Yet you believed it! Thus\r\nyou not only thought me capable of this atrocious frenzy, but even\r\ndreaded you had exposed yourself to it by your indulgence. Ah! if you\r\nthink yourself so much degraded by your love, I must be very despicable\r\nin your sight. Oppressed by the painful sense of this idea, I lose the\r\ntime I should employ in destroying it, endeavouring to repel it. I will\r\nconfess all: another consideration still prevents me. Must I go back to\r\nfacts I would wish to forget for ever, and recall your attention and\r\nmy own to errors I shall ever repent; the cause of which I cannot yet\r\nconceive, which fill me with mortification and despair. If I excite\r\nyour anger by accusing myself, the means of revenge will not be out of\r\nyour reach; it will be sufficient to abandon me to my own remorse.\r\n\r\nYet the first cause of this unhappy event is, the all-powerful charm I\r\nfeel in being with you: it was it made me too long forget an important\r\nbusiness that could not be put off. I stayed with you so long, I did\r\nnot find the person at home I wanted to see; I expected to have met her\r\nat the opera, where I was also disappointed. Emily, who I met there,\r\nand knew at a time when I was a stranger to you and love, Emily had not\r\nher carriage, and requested I would set her down at a little distance\r\nfrom thence; I consented, as a matter of no consequence. It was then I\r\nmet you. I was instantly seized with the apprehension you would think\r\nme guilty.\r\n\r\nThe dread of afflicting or displeasing you is so powerful, it is\r\nimpossible for me to conceal it, and was soon perceived. I will even\r\nown, it induced me to prevail on this girl not to show herself; this\r\nprecaution, the result of delicacy, was unfavourable to love: but she,\r\nlike the rest of her tribe, accustomed to the abuse of her usurped\r\npower, would not let slip so splendid an opportunity. The more she\r\nobserved my embarrassment increase, the more she affected to show\r\nherself; and her ridiculous mirth, which I blush to think you could for\r\na moment imagine yourself to be the object, had no other foundation\r\nthan the cruel anxiety I felt, which proceeded from my love and respect.\r\n\r\nSo far, doubtless, I am more unfortunate than guilty. Those crimes\r\nbeing thus done away, I am clear of reproach. In vain, however, are you\r\nsilent on those of love, which I must break through, as it concerns me\r\nso much.\r\n\r\nNot but, in my confusion for this unaccountable misconduct, which\r\nI cannot without great grief recall to my remembrance; yet I am so\r\nsensible of my error, I would patiently bear the punishment, wait my\r\npardon from time, from my excessive love, and my repentance; only what\r\nI yet have to say concerns your delicacy.\r\n\r\nDo not think I seek a pretence to excuse or palliate my fault; I\r\nconfess my guilt: but I do not acknowledge, nor ever will, this\r\nhumiliating error can be a crime of love. For where is the analogy\r\nbetween a surprise of the sensations, a moment of inadvertency, which\r\nis soon replaced by shame and regret, and an immaculate sentiment,\r\nwhich delicate souls are only capable of, supported by esteem, and of\r\nwhich happiness is the fruit? Ah! do not thus profane love; or, rather,\r\ndo not profane yourself, by uniting in the same point of view what\r\nnever can be blended. Leave to despicable and degraded women the dread\r\nof a rivalship, and experience the torments of a cruel and humiliating\r\njealousy; but turn your eyes from objects that would sully them: and\r\npure as the Divinity, punish the offence without feeling it.\r\n\r\nWhat punishment can you inflict on me will be more sorrowful than what\r\nI already feel—that can be comparable to the grief of having incurred\r\nyour displeasure—to the despair of giving you affliction—to the\r\nunsufferable idea of being unworthy of you? Your mind is taken up with\r\npunishing, whilst I languish for consolation; not that I deserve it,\r\nbut only that I am in want of it, and that it is you alone can console\r\nme.\r\n\r\nIf on a sudden, forgetful of our mutual love as of my happiness,\r\nyou will abandon me to perpetual sorrow, I shall not dispute your\r\nright—strike: but should you incline to indulgence, and again recall\r\nthose tender sentiments that united our hearts; that voluptuousness\r\nof soul, ever renewing, ever increasing; those delightful days we\r\npassed together; all the felicities that love only can give; you will,\r\nperhaps, prefer the power of renewing to that of destroying them. What\r\nshall I say? I have lost all, and lost it by my own folly: but still\r\nall may be retrieved by your goodness. You are now to decide. I shall\r\nadd but one word more. Yesterday you swore my happiness was certain\r\nwhilst it depended on you. Ah! will you this day, then, Madam, give me\r\nup to everlasting despair?\r\n\r\n_Paris, Nov._ 15, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXVIII.\r\n\r\nViscount de Valmont _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nI insist on it, my charming friend, I am not in love; and it is\r\nnot my fault, if circumstances oblige me to play the character of\r\na lover.—Only consent to return, and you will be able to judge my\r\nsincerity—I made my proofs yesterday, and cannot be injured by what\r\nhappens to-day.\r\n\r\nI was with the tender prude, having nothing else to do; for the little\r\nVolanges, nothwithstanding her situation, was to spend the night at\r\nMadame de V——’s early ball: the want of business first gave me an\r\ninclination to prolong the evening; and I had, with this intention,\r\neven required a little sacrifice: it was scarcely granted, than the\r\npleasure I promised myself was disturbed with the idea of this love\r\nwhich you so obstinately will have it, or at least reproach me with\r\nbeing infected; so I determined at once to be certain myself, and\r\nconvince you, that it was a calumny of your own.\r\n\r\nIn consequence I took a violent resolution; on a very slight pretence,\r\nI took leave, and left my fair one quite surprised, and doubtless more\r\nafflicted, while I quietly went to meet Emily at the opera: she can\r\nsatisfy you, that until morning, when we parted, no regret disturbed\r\nour amusements.\r\n\r\nYet there was a pretty large field for uneasiness, if my total\r\nindifference had not preserved me: for you must know, I was scarce four\r\nhouses from the opera, with Emily in my carriage, when that of the\r\naustere devotee ranged close beside mine, and a stop which happened,\r\nleft us near half a quarter of an hour close by each other; we could\r\nsee one another as plain as at noon day, and there was no means to\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nThat is not all; I took it in my head to tell Emily confidentially,\r\nthat was the letter-woman. You may recollect, perhaps, that piece of\r\nfolly, and that Emily was the desk[1]. She did not forget it, and as\r\nshe laughs immoderately, she was not easy until she had attentively\r\nviewed this piece of virtue, as she called her; and with scandalous\r\nbursts, such as would even disconcert effrontery.\r\n\r\nStill this is not all; the jealous woman sent to my house that same\r\nnight; I was not at home, but she obstinately sent a second time,\r\nwith orders to wait my return. I sent my carriage home, as soon as I\r\nresolved to spend the night with Emily, without any other orders to\r\nmy coachman, than to return this morning. When he got home he found\r\nthe messenger, whom he informed I was not to return that night. You\r\nmay guess the effect of this news, and that at my return, I found my\r\ndischarge announced with all the dignity the circumstance required.\r\n\r\nThus, this adventure, which according to your opinion, was never to\r\nbe determined, could, as you see, have been ended this morning? if it\r\nshould not, I would not have you think I prize a continuance of it; but\r\nI do not think it consistent with my character to be quitted: moreover,\r\nI intend to reserve the honour of this sacrifice for you.\r\n\r\nI have answered her severe note with a long sentimental epistle; I have\r\ngiven long reasons, and rely on love to make them acceptable. I have\r\nalready succeeded—I have received a second note, still very rigorous,\r\nand which confirms an everlasting rupture, as it ought to be—but\r\nthe ton is not the same; I must not be seen again; this resolution is\r\nannounced four times in the most irrevocable manner. From thence I\r\nconcluded, there was not a moment to be lost in presenting myself: I\r\nhave already sent my huntsman to secure the porter, and shall follow\r\ninstantly, to have my pardon sealed: for in crimes of this nature,\r\nthere is only one form for a general absolution, and that must be\r\nexecuted in each others presence.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my charming friend! I fly to achieve this grand event.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Nov._ 15, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Letters xlvi and xlvii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXXXIX.\r\n\r\n_The_ Presidente de Tourvel _to_ Madame de Rosemonde.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow I reproach myself, my dear friend, for having wrote too soon, and\r\nsaid too much of my transitory troubles! I am the cause you at present\r\nare afflicted; the chagrin I have given you still continues, and I am\r\nhappy; yes, every thing is forgot, and I forgive; or rather all is\r\ncleared up. Calm and delight succeed this state of grief and anguish;\r\nhow shall I express the ecstasy of my heart! Valmont is innocent: with\r\nso much love there can be no guilt—those heavy offensive crimes with\r\nwhich I loaded him so bitterly, he did not deserve; and although I was\r\nright in one single point, yet I was to make reparation for my unjust\r\nsuspicions.\r\n\r\nI will not relate minutely the circumstances of facts or reasonings in\r\nhis justification—Perhaps even the mind would but badly appreciate\r\nthem—it is the heart only can feel them. However, were you even to\r\nsuspect me of weakness, I would call on your judgment in support of my\r\nown; you say among men infidelity is not inconstancy.\r\n\r\nNot but I am sensible, this opinion, which custom authorises, hurts\r\ndelicacy: but why should mine complain, when Valmont’s suffers more?\r\nThis same injury which I forget, I do not think he forgives himself;\r\nand yet he has immensely repaired this trivial error, by the excess of\r\nhis love, and my happiness!\r\n\r\nMy felicity is greater, or I know the value of it better, since my\r\ndread of losing him; I can aver to you, if I had strength sufficient\r\nto undergo again such cruel chagrins as I have just experienced, I\r\nshould not think I had purchased my increase of happiness at too high a\r\nrate. Oh, my dear mother! scold your unthinking daughter for afflicting\r\nyou by her precipitation; scold her for having rashly judged him she\r\nshould ever adore; and knowing her imprudence, see her happy: augment\r\nher bliss by partaking it.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Nov._ 15, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXL.\r\n\r\n_The_ Viscount de Valmont _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow comes it, my charming friend, I receive no answers from you? I\r\nthink, however, my last letter deserved one; these three days have I\r\nbeen expecting it, and must still wait! I really am vexed, and shall\r\nnot relate a syllable of my grand affairs.\r\n\r\nSuch as the reconciliation had its full effect: that instead of\r\nreproaches and dissidence, it produced fresh proofs of affection; that\r\nI now actually receive the excuse and satisfaction due to my suspected\r\ncandour; not a word shall you know—had it not been for the unforeseen\r\nevent of last night, I should not have wrote to you at all; but as it\r\nrelates to your pupil, who probably cannot give you any information\r\nherself, at least for some time, I have taken upon me to acquaint you\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nFor reasons you may or may not guess, Madame de Tourvel, has not\r\nengaged my attention for some days: as those reasons could not exist\r\nwith the little Volanges, I became more assiduous there. Thanks to the\r\nobliging porter, I had no obstacles to surmount; and your pupil and I\r\nled a comfortable, regular life—Custom brings on negligence; at first\r\nwe had not taken proper precautions for our security; we trembled\r\nbehind the locks: yesterday an incredible absence of mind occasioned\r\nthe accident I am going to relate; as to myself, fear was my only\r\npunishment, but the little girl did not come off so well.\r\n\r\nWe were not asleep, but reposing in the abandonment consequent to\r\nvoluptuousness, when on a sudden, we heard the room door open, I\r\ninstantly seized my sword to defend myself and our pupil; I advanced,\r\nand saw no one; but the door was open: as we had a light, I examined\r\nall about the room, and did not find a mortal; then I recollected we\r\nhad forgot our usual precautions, and certainly the door being only\r\npushed or not properly shut, opened of itself.\r\n\r\nReturning to my terrified companion to quiet her, I did not find her\r\nin the bed; she fell out, or hid herself by the bedside; at length\r\nI found her there, stretched senseless on the ground, in strong\r\nconvulsions—You may judge my embarrassment—However, I brought her to\r\nherself, and got her into bed again, but she had hurt herself in the\r\nfall, and was not long before she felt its effect.\r\n\r\nPains in the loins, violent cholics, and other symptoms less equivocal,\r\nsoon informed me her condition—To make her sensible of it, it was\r\nnecessary to acquaint her with the one she was in before, of which she\r\nhad not the least suspicion: never any one before her, perhaps, went\r\nto work so innocently to get rid of it—she does not lose her time in\r\nreflection.\r\n\r\nBut she lost a great deal in afflicting herself, and I found it\r\nnecessary to come to some resolution: therefore we agreed I should\r\nimmediately go to the physician and surgeon of the family, to inform\r\nthem they would be sent for; I was to make them a confidence of the\r\nwhole business, under a promise of secrecy—That she should ring for\r\nher waiting maid, and should or should not make her a confidence of\r\nher situation, as she thought proper; but at all events, send for\r\nassistance, and should forbid her from disturbing Madame de Volanges.\r\nAn attentive delicacy natural to a girl who feared to give her mother\r\nuneasiness.\r\n\r\nI made my two visits and confessions as expeditiously as I could, and\r\nthen went home, from whence I have not since stirred. The surgeon, who\r\nI knew before, came to me at noon, to give me an account of the state\r\nof his patient—I was not mistaken—He hopes, however, it will not\r\nbe attended with any bad consequences. Provided no accident happens,\r\nit will not be discovered in the house; the waiting woman is in the\r\nsecret; the physician has given the disorder a name, and this affair\r\nwill be settled as a thousand others have been, unless hereafter it\r\nmight be useful to us to have it mentioned.\r\n\r\nHave you and I mutual interests or no? Your silence makes me dubious\r\nof it; I would not even think at all of it, if my inclinations did\r\nnot lead me on to every method of preserving the hope of it. Adieu, my\r\ncharming friend! yet in anger.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Nov._ 21, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLI.\r\n\r\n_The_ Marchioness de Merteuil _to the_ Viscount de Valmont.\r\n\r\n\r\nGood God, Viscount! How troublesome you are with your obstinacy! What\r\nmatters my silence to you? Do you believe it is for want of reasons I\r\nam silent? Ah! would to God! But no, it is only because it would be\r\npainful to tell them to you.\r\n\r\nSpeak truth, do you deceive yourself, or do you mean to deceive me? The\r\ndifference between your discourse and actions, leaves in doubt which I\r\nam to give credit to. What shall I say to you then, when I even do not\r\nknow what to think?\r\n\r\nYou seem to make a great merit of your last scene with the Presidente;\r\nbut what does that prove in support of your system, or against mine? I\r\nnever certainly told you, your love for this woman was so violent as\r\nnot be capable of deceiving her, or prevent you from enjoying every\r\nopportunity that appeared agreeable and easy to you. I never even\r\ndoubted but it would be equally the same to you, to satisfy, with any\r\nother, the first that offered, the desires she would raise. I am not at\r\nall surprised, that from a libertinism of mind, which it would be wrong\r\nto contend with you, you have once done designedly, what you have a\r\nthousand times done occasionally—Don’t we well know this is the way of\r\nthe world, and the practice of you all? and whoever acts otherwise is\r\nlooked on as a simpleton—I think I don’t charge you with this defect.\r\n\r\nWhat I have said, what I have thought, what I still think, is, you\r\nare nevertheless in love with your Presidente: not if you will with a\r\npure and tender passion, but of that kind of which you are capable;\r\nfor example, of that kind which makes you discover in a woman, charms\r\nand qualities she has not: which ranks her in a class by herself, and\r\nstill links you to her even while you insult her—Such, in a word, as\r\na Sultan has for a favourite Sultana; that does not prevent him from\r\noften giving the preference to a plain Odalisk. My comparison appears\r\nto me the more just, as, like him, you never are the lover or friend\r\nof a woman, but always her tyrant or her slave. And I am very certain,\r\nyou very much humbled and debased yourself very much, to get into\r\nfavour again with this fine object! Happy in your success, as soon as\r\nyou think the moment arrived to obtain your pardon, you leave me _for\r\nthis grand event_.\r\n\r\nEven in your last letter, the reason you give for not entertaining me\r\nsolely with this woman is, because you will not tell me any thing of\r\nyour _grand affairs_; they are of so much importance, that your silence\r\non that subject is to be my punishment: and after giving me such strong\r\nproofs of a decided preference for another, you coolly ask me whether\r\n_we have a mutual interest!_ Have a care, Viscount; if I once answer\r\nyou, my answer shall be irrevocable: and to be in suspense, is perhaps\r\nsaying too much; I will therefore now say no more of that matter.\r\n\r\nI have nothing more to say, but to tell you a trifling story; perhaps\r\nyou will not have leisure to read it, or to give so much attention\r\nto it as to understand it properly? At worst, it will be only a tale\r\nthrown away.\r\n\r\nA man of my acquaintance, like you, was entangled with a woman,\r\nwho did him very little credit; he had sense enough, at times, to\r\nperceive, this adventure would hurt him one time or other—Although\r\nhe was ashamed of it, yet he had not the resolution to break off—His\r\nembarrassment was greater, as he had frequently boasted to his friends,\r\nhe was entirely at liberty; and was not insensible, the more he\r\napologised, the more the ridicule increased—Thus, he spent his time\r\nincessantly in foolery, and constantly saying, _it is not my fault._\r\nThis man had a friend, who was one time very near giving him up in\r\nhis frenzy to indelible ridicule: but yet, being more generous than\r\nmalicious, or perhaps from some other motive, she resolved, as a last\r\neffort, to try a method to be able, at least, with her friend, to say,\r\n_it is not my fault._ She therefore sent him, without farther ceremony,\r\nthe following letter, as a remedy for his disorder.\r\n\r\n“One tires of every thing, my angel! It is a law of nature; it is not\r\nmy fault.\r\n\r\n“If, then, I am tired of a connection that has entirely taken me up\r\nfour long months, it is not my fault.\r\n\r\n“If, for example, I had just as much love as you had virtue, and that’s\r\nsaying a great deal, it is not at all surprising that one should end\r\nwith the other; it is not my fault.\r\n\r\n“It follows, then, that for some time past, I have deceived you; but\r\nyour unmerciful affection in some measure forced me to it! It is not my\r\nfault.\r\n\r\n“Now a woman I love to distraction, insists I must sacrifice you: it is\r\nnot my fault.\r\n\r\n“I am sensible here is a fine field for reproaches; but if nature has\r\nonly granted men constancy, whilst it gives obstinacy to women, it is\r\nnot my fault.\r\n\r\n“Take my advice, choose another lover, as I have another mistress—The\r\nadvice is good; if you think otherwise, it is not my fault.\r\n\r\n“Farewell, my angel! I took you with pleasure, I part you without\r\nregret; perhaps I shall return to you; it is the way of the world; it\r\nis not my fault.”\r\n\r\nThis is not the time to tell you, Viscount, the effect of this last\r\neffort, and its consequences; but I promise to give it you in my next\r\nletter; you will then receive also my ultimatum on renewing the treaty\r\nyou propose. Until when, adieu.\r\n\r\nNow I think on it, receive my thanks for your particular account of the\r\nlittle Volanges; that article will keep till the day after her wedding,\r\nfor the scandalous gazette. I condole with you, however, on the loss of\r\nyour progeny. Good night, Viscount.\r\n\r\n_Nov._ 24, 17—. _Castle of ——._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLII.\r\n\r\nViscount de Valmont _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nI don’t know, my charming friend, whether I have read or understood\r\nbadly your letter, the little tale you relate, and the epistolary model\r\nit contains—But this I must say, the last is an original, and seems\r\nvery proper to take effect; therefore I only copied it, and sent it\r\nwithout farther ceremony to the celestial Presidente. I did not lose\r\na moment, for the tender epistle was dispatched yesterday evening—I\r\nchose to act so; for first, I had promised to write to her; and,\r\nmoreover, I thought a whole night not too much for her to collect\r\nherself, and ruminate on _this grand event_, were you even to reproach\r\nme a second time with the expression.\r\n\r\nI expected to have sent you back this morning my well-beloved’s answer;\r\nit is now near twelve, and it is not yet come—I shall wait until five;\r\nand if I receive no news by that time, I shall in person seek it, for\r\nevery thing must be done according to form, and the difficulty is only\r\nin this first step.\r\n\r\nNow you may believe I am impatient to know the end of your story of\r\nthat man of your acquaintance, who was so violently suspected of not\r\nknowing how to sacrifice a woman upon occasion—Did he not amend, and\r\ndid not his generous friend forgive him?\r\n\r\nI am no less anxious to receive your ultimatum as you call it so\r\npolitically; but I am curious, above all, to know if you can perceive\r\nany impression of love in this last proceeding? Ah! doubtless there\r\nis, and a good deal! But for whom? Still I make no pretensions; I\r\nexpect every thing from your goodness.\r\n\r\nAdieu, charmer! I shall not close my letter until two, in hope of\r\nadding the wished-for answer.\r\n\r\n_Two o’clock in the afternoon._\r\n\r\nNothing yet—the time slips away; I can’t spare a moment—but surely\r\nnow you will not refuse the tenderest kisses of love.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Nov._ 27, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLIII.\r\n\r\n_The_ Presidente de Tourvel _to_ Madame de Rosemonde.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe veil is rent, Madam, on which was painted my illusory\r\nhappiness—The fatal truth is cleared, that leaves me no prospect but\r\nan assured and speedy death; and my road is traced between shame and\r\nremorse. I will follow it—I will cherish my torments if they will\r\nshorten my existence—I send you the letter I received yesterday; it\r\nneeds no reflections; it contains them all—This is not a time for\r\nlamentation—nothing remains but sufferings—I want not pity, I want\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nReceive, Madame, the only adieu I shall make, and grant my last\r\nrequest: leave me to my fate—forget me totally—do not reckon me\r\namong the living. There is a limit in misery, when even friendship\r\naugments our sufferings and cannot cure them—When wounds are mortal,\r\nall relief is cruel. Every sentiment but despair is foreign to my\r\nsoul—nothing can now suit me, but the darkness where I am going to\r\nbury my shame—There will I weep crimes, if I yet can weep; for since\r\nyesterday I have not shed a tear—my withered heart no longer furnishes\r\nany.\r\n\r\nAdieu, Madame! Do not reply to this—I have taken a solemn oath on this\r\nletter never to receive another.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Nov._ 27, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLIV.\r\n\r\nViscount de Valmont _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nYesterday, at three in the afternoon, being impatient, my lovely\r\nfriend, at not having any news, I presented myself at the house of\r\nthe fair abandoned, and was told she was gone out. In this reply I\r\ncould see nothing more than a refusal to admit me, which neither\r\nsurprised nor vexed me; I retired, in hope this step would induce so\r\npolished a woman to give me an answer. The desire I had to receive one,\r\nmade me call home about nine, but found nothing. Astonished at this\r\nsilence, which I did not expect, I sent my huntsman on the enquiry for\r\ninformation, whether the tender fair was dead or dying. At my return,\r\nhe informed me, Madame de Tourvel had actually gone out at eleven in\r\nthe morning with her waiting maid; that she ordered her carriage to the\r\nconvent of ——; that at seven in the evening she had sent her carriage\r\nand servants back, sending word they should not expect her home. This\r\nis certainly acting with propriety. The convent is the only asylum\r\nfor a widow; and if she persists in so laudable a resolution, I shall\r\nadd to all the obligations I already lay under, the celebrity this\r\nadventure will now have.\r\n\r\nI told you sometime ago, notwithstanding your uneasiness, I would again\r\nappear in the world with more brilliant eclat. Let those severe critics\r\nnow show themselves, who accused me of a romantic passion; let them\r\nmake a more expeditious and shining rupture: no, let them do more; bid\r\nthem go offer their consolations—the road is chalked out for them; let\r\nthem only dare run the career I have gone over entirely, and if any one\r\nobtains the least success, I will yield him up the first place: but\r\nthey shall all experience when I am in earnest; the impression I leave\r\nis indelible. This one I affirm will be so. I should even look on all\r\nformer triumphs as trifles, if I was ever to have a favoured rival.\r\n\r\nI own the step she has taken flatters my vanity; yet I am sorry she had\r\nso much fortitude to separate from me. There will be no obstacle, then,\r\nbetween us, but of my own formation. If I should be inclined to renew\r\nour connection, she, perhaps, would refuse; perhaps not pant for it,\r\nnot think it the summit of happiness! Is this love? And do you think,\r\nmy charming friend, I should bear it? Could I not, for example, and\r\nwould it not be better, endeavour to bring this woman to the point\r\nof foreseeing a possibility of a reconciliation, always wished for\r\nwhile there is hope? I could try this course without any consequence,\r\nwithout giving you umbrage. It would be only a mere trial we would\r\nmake in concert. Even if I should be successful, it would be only an\r\nadditional means of renewing, at your pleasure, a sacrifice which has\r\nseemed agreeable to you. Now, my charming friend, I am yet to receive\r\nmy reward, and all my vows are for your return. Come, then, speedily to\r\nyour lover, your pleasures, your friends, and the pursuit of adventures.\r\n\r\nThat of the little Volanges has had a surprising turn. Yesterday, as my\r\nuneasiness would not suffer me to stay long in a place, in my various\r\nexcursions I called at Madame Volanges’s. I found your pupil in the\r\nsaloon, in the drapery of a sick person, but in full health, fresher,\r\nand more interesting. Some of you ladies, in such a case would keep\r\nyour beds for a month, Oh, rare lasses! Egad, this one has given me a\r\nstrong inclination to know if the cure be complete.\r\n\r\nI had almost forgot to tell you, the little girl’s accident had like\r\nto have turned your _sentimental_ Danceny’s brain: at first it was\r\nfor grief, but now it is with joy. _His Cecilia_ was sick. You will\r\nagree, the brain must turn with such a misfortune. Three times a day\r\ndid he send to enquire about her, and never missed every day going\r\nhimself; at last, he wrote a fine epistle to the mama, begging leave\r\nto go and congratulate her on the recovery of so dear an object;\r\nMadame de Volanges assented; so that I found the young man established\r\nas heretofore, only not quite so familiar. This narrative I had from\r\nhimself; for I came out with him, and made him prate. You can’t\r\nconceive what an effect this visit had on him; his joy, his wishes,\r\nhis transports are inexpressible. As I am fond of grand emotions, I\r\nfinished him, by telling him, in a few days I hoped to place him much\r\nnearer his fair one.\r\n\r\nI am determined to give her up to him as soon as I have made my trial.\r\nI will devote myself entirely to you; moreover, I don’t see it would\r\nbe worth while your pupil should be my scholar, if she had only a\r\nhusband to deceive. The _chef d’œuvre_ is to deceive the lover!\r\nand the first lover too! For I can’t reproach myself with even having\r\npronounced the word love.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my lovely friend! Return as soon as possible to resume your\r\nempire over me, to receive my homage, and give me my reward.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Nov._ 28, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLV.\r\n\r\n_The_ Marchioness de Merteuil _to the_ Viscount de Valmont.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow seriously, Viscount, have you left the Presidente? Did you send\r\nher the letter I wrote you for her? You are a charming fellow, indeed,\r\nand have surpassed my expectations! I must own, this triumph flatters\r\nme more than all those I ever obtained. You will think, perhaps, I\r\nestimate this woman very highly, who I depreciated very lately; not in\r\nthe least: but it is not over her this advantage is gained; it is over\r\nyou; there lies the jest, and it is really delightful.\r\n\r\nYes, Viscount, you loved Madame de Tourvel much, and you still love\r\nher; you love her to distraction: but because I made you ashamed, by\r\nway of amusement, you nobly sacrifice her. You would have sacrificed\r\na thousand women rather than be laughed at. To what lengths will not\r\nvanity lead us! The wise man was right when he said it was the foe to\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nWhat would become of you now, if it had been only a trick I put upon\r\nyou? But I am incapable of deceit, and you know it well; and should you\r\neven in my turn reduce me to despair and a convent, I will risk it, and\r\nsurrender to my conqueror. Still, if I do capitulate, upon my word it\r\nis from mere frailty; for were I inclined, how many cavils could I not\r\nstart! and, perhaps, you would deserve them!\r\n\r\nI admire, for example, with how much address, or awkwardness rather,\r\nyou soothingly propose I should let you renew with your Presidente.\r\nIt would be very convenient, would it not? to take all the merit of\r\nthis rapture without losing the pleasure of enjoyment! And then this\r\nproffered sacrifice, which would no longer be one to you, is offered to\r\nbe renewed at my pleasure! By this arrangement, the celestial devotee\r\nwould always think herself the only choice of your heart, whilst I\r\nshould wrap myself up in the pride of being the preferred rival; we\r\nshould both be deceived; you would be satisfied: all the rest is of no\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\nIt is much to be lamented, that with such extraordinary talents for\r\nprojects, you have so few for execution; and that by one inconsiderate\r\nstep, you put an insurmountable obstacle to what you so much wished.\r\n\r\nWhat! you had, then, an idea of renewing your connection, and yet you\r\ncopied my letter! You must, then, have thought me awkward indeed!\r\nBelieve me, Viscount, when a woman strikes at the heart of another,\r\nshe seldom misses her blow, and the wound is incurable. When I struck\r\nthis one, or rather directed the blow, I did not forget she was my\r\nrival, that you had for a moment preferred her to me, placed me beneath\r\nher. If I am deceived in my revenge, I consent to bear the blame;\r\ntherefore, I agree you may attempt every means; even I invite you to\r\nit, and promise you I shall not be angry at your success. I am so easy\r\non this matter, I shall say no more of it: let us talk of something\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nAs to the health of the little Volanges, you will be able to give me\r\nsome positive news at my return. I shall be glad to have some. After\r\nthat, you will be the best judge whether it will be most convenient to\r\ngive the little girl up to her lover, or endeavour to be the founder of\r\na new branch of the Valmonts, under the name of Gercourt. This idea\r\npleases me much: but in leaving the choice to yourself, I must yet\r\nrequire you will not come to a definitive resolution until we talk the\r\nmatter over. It is not putting you off for a long time, for I shall be\r\nin Paris immediately. I can’t positively say the day; but be assured,\r\nas soon as I arrive, you shall be the first informed of it.\r\n\r\nAdieu, Viscount! notwithstanding my quarrels, my mischievousness, and\r\nmy reproaches, I always love you much, and am preparing to prove it.\r\nAdieu, till our next meeting.\r\n\r\n_Castle of_ ——, _Nov._ 29, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLVI.\r\n\r\n_The_ Marchioness de Merteuil _to the_ Chevalier Danceny.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last I set out, my young friend; to-morrow evening I shall be in\r\nParis. The hurry always attending a removal will prevent me from seeing\r\nany one. Yet if you should have any pressing confidential business to\r\nimpart, I shall except you from the general rule: but I except you\r\nalone; therefore request my arrival may be a secret. I shall not even\r\ninform Valmont of it.\r\n\r\nWhoever would have told me, sometime ago, you would have my exclusive\r\nconfidence, I would not have believed them: but yours drew on mine.\r\nI should be inclined to think you had made use of some address, or,\r\nperhaps, seduction. That would be wrong, indeed! however, it would not\r\nat present be very dangerous; you have other business in hand. When the\r\nheroine is on the stage, we seldom take notice of the confidant.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, you have not had time to impart your late success to me.\r\nWhen your Cecilia was absent, the days were too short to listen to your\r\nplaintive strains. You would have told them to the echo, if I had not\r\nbeen ready to hear them. Since, when she was ill, you even honoured me\r\nwith a recital of your troubles; you wanted some one to tell them to:\r\nbut now your love is in Paris, that she is quite recovered, and you\r\nsometimes see her, your friends are quite neglected.\r\n\r\nI do not blame you in the least, it is a fault of youth; for it is a\r\nreceived truth, that from Alcibiades down to you, young people are\r\nunacquainted with friendship but in adversity. Happiness sometimes\r\nmakes them indiscreet, but never presumptuous. I will say, with\r\nSocrates, _I like my friends to come to me when they are unhappy:_ but,\r\nas a philosopher, he did very well without them if they did not come.\r\nI am not quite so wise as he, for I felt your silence with all the\r\nweakness of a woman.\r\n\r\nHowever, do not think me too exacting; far from it. The same sentiment\r\nthat leads me to observe those privations, makes me bear them with\r\nfortitude, when they are proofs, or the cause of the happiness of my\r\nfriends. I shall, therefore, not depend on you for to-morrow evening,\r\nonly as far as is consistent with love and want of occupation; and I\r\npositively forbid you to make me the least sacrifice.\r\n\r\nAdieu, Chevalier! it will be an absolute regale to see you again—will\r\nyou come?\r\n\r\n_Castle of_ ——, _Nov._ 29, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLVII.\r\n\r\nMadame de Volanges _to_ Madame de Rosemonde.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will most assuredly be as much afflicted, my dear friend, as I\r\nam, when I acquaint you with Madame de Tourvel’s state; she has been\r\nindisposed since yesterday: she was taken so suddenly, and her disorder\r\nis of such an alarming nature, that I am really frightened about it.\r\n\r\nA burning fever, an almost constant and violent delirium, a perpetual\r\nthirst, are the symptoms. The physicians say, they cannot as yet form\r\ntheir prognostics; and their endeavours are frustrated, as the patient\r\nobstinately refuses every kind of remedy: insomuch, that they were\r\nobliged to use force to bleed her; and were twice since forced to use\r\nthe same method, to tie up the bandages, which she tore off in her fits.\r\n\r\nYou and I, who have seen her, so weak, so timid, so mild, could hardly\r\nconceive that four persons scarcely could hold her; and on the least\r\nremonstrance she flies out in the greatest rage imaginable: for my\r\npart, I fear it is something worse than a raving, and borders on\r\ndownright madness.\r\n\r\nAnd what happened the day before yesterday adds to my fears.\r\n\r\nOn that day she came about eleven in the morning to the convent of\r\n—— with her waiting maid. As she was educated in that house, and\r\noccasionally came to visit there, she was received as usual, and\r\nappeared to every one in good health and very quiet. In about two hours\r\nafter she asked, whether the room she had, whilst she was a pensioner,\r\nwas vacant? and being answered in the affirmative, she begged leave to\r\nsee it; the prioress and some of the nuns accompanied her. She then\r\ndeclared she came back to settle in this room, which, said she, I ought\r\nnever to have quitted; adding, she would not depart from it _until\r\ndeath:_ that was her expression.\r\n\r\nAt first, they stared at each other: but the first surprise being over,\r\nthey remonstrated, that, as a married woman, she could not be received\r\nwithout a special permission. That, and a thousand other arguments were\r\nunavailable; and from that moment she was obstinate, not only to remain\r\nin the convent, but even not to stir from the room. At length, being\r\ntired out, they consented, at seven in the evening, she should remain\r\nthere that night. Her carriage and servants were sent home, and they\r\nadjourned until the next day.\r\n\r\nI have been assured, during the whole night her appearance and\r\ndeportment did not exhibit the least wandering symptom; on the\r\ncontrary, she seemed composed and deliberate; only fell into a profound\r\nreverie four or five times, which conversation could not remove; and\r\nevery time before she recovered from it, she seemed forcibly to squeeze\r\nher forehead with both hands: on which one of the nuns asked her if she\r\nhad a pain in her head; she fixed her eyes on her sometime before she\r\nreplied, and said, “My disorder is not there.” Immediately after she\r\nbegged to be left alone, and also, that in future they should not put\r\nany questions to her.\r\n\r\nEvery one retired except her waiting maid, who was fortunately obliged\r\nto sleep in the same chamber.\r\n\r\nAccording to the girl’s account, her mistress was pretty quiet until\r\nabout eleven at night; then she said she would go to bed: but before\r\nshe was quite undressed, she walked to and fro in her room with much\r\naction and gesture. Julie, who was present at every thing that passed\r\nduring the day, did not dare say a word, and silently waited near an\r\nhour. At length, Madame de Tourvel called her twice on a sudden; she\r\nhad scarce time to reach her, when her mistress dropped in her arms,\r\nsaying, “I can hold out no longer.” She suffered her to lead her to\r\nher bed; but would not take any thing, nor allow her to call for\r\nassistance. She ordered her only to leave her some water, and go to\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nThe girl avers, she did not go to sleep till two in the morning, and\r\nheard neither disturbance nor complaint. At five she was awoke by her\r\nmistress, who spoke in a strong loud tone. She asked, if she wanted any\r\nthing; but receiving no answer, she went to Madame de Tourvel’s bedside\r\nwith a light, who did not know her; but breaking off her incoherent\r\ndiscourse, exclaimed violently, “Leave me alone! Let me be left in\r\ndarkness! It is darkness alone suits me!” I remarked yesterday, she\r\noften repeated those expressions.\r\n\r\nAt last, Julie took this opportunity to go out and call for assistance,\r\nwhich Madame de Tourvel refused with the greatest fury and madness.\r\nThese fits have often returned since.\r\n\r\nThe distress the whole convent was thrown in, induced the Prioress to\r\nsend for me yesterday morning at seven, when it was not yet day. I went\r\nimmediately. When I was announced to Madame de Tourvel, she seemed to\r\ncome to herself, and said, “Ah! yes, let her come in.” She fixed her\r\neyes on me when I came near her bed, and seizing my hand suddenly,\r\nshe squeezed it, saying, in a strong, melancholy tone, “I die for not\r\nhaving taken your advice;” and immediately covering her eyes, she\r\nresumed her delirium of “Leave me alone,” &c. and lost all reason.\r\n\r\nThose discourses, and some others that fell from her in her delirium,\r\nmake me apprehend this dreadful disorder has still a more cruel cause;\r\nbut let us respect the secrets of our friend, and pity her misfortune.\r\n\r\nAll yesterday was equally stormy, either fits of frightful\r\ndeliriousness, or lethargic faintness, the only time when she takes or\r\ngives any rest. I did not leave her bed’s head until nine at night,\r\nand am going again this morning for the day.\r\n\r\nI will not certainly abandon our unhappy friend: but her obstinacy in\r\nrefusing all help and assistance is very distressing.\r\n\r\nI enclose you the journal of last night, which I have just received,\r\nand which, as you will see, brings but little consolation. I will take\r\ncare to send them you regularly.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my worthy friend! I am going to visit our poor friend. My\r\ndaughter, who is perfectly recovered, presents her compliments to you.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Nov._ 29, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLVIII.\r\n\r\n_The_ Chevalier Danceny _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nO you, whom I love! O thou, whom I adore! O you, with whom my happiness\r\nhath commenced! O thou, who hast completed it! Compassionate friend!\r\ntender mistress! why does the reflection that you are a prey to grief\r\ncome to disturb my charmed mind? Ah, Madam! resume your calmness; it is\r\nthe duty of friendship to make this entreaty. O my heart’s only object!\r\nbe happy; it is the prayer of love.\r\n\r\nWhat reproaches have you to make to yourself? Believe me, your\r\nextraordinary delicacy misleads you. The regret it occasions you,\r\nthe injuries it charges me with, are equally imaginary; and I feel\r\nwithin my heart, that there has been between us no other seducer than\r\nlove. No longer dread, then, to yield to those sentiments you inspire,\r\nor to partake of a flame you have kindled. What! would we have had\r\nmore reason to boast of purity in our connection, if it had taken\r\nmore time to form? Undoubtedly not. That is the characteristic of\r\nseduction, which, never acting unless by projects, is able to regulate\r\nits progress and means, and foresees events at a great distance: but\r\ntrue love does not permit that kind of meditation and reflection; it\r\ndiverts us from thought with occupying us wholly with sentiments. Its\r\nempire is never more powerful than when unknown; and it is in obscurity\r\nand silence that it steals upon us, and binds us in chains equally\r\nimpossible to be perceived or to be broken.\r\n\r\nThus, even yesterday, notwithstanding the lively emotions which the\r\nidea of your return caused in me, in defiance of the extreme pleasure\r\nI felt on seeing you, I nevertheless thought myself led and called\r\nupon by serene friendship alone, or rather entirely absorbed by the\r\nsweet sentiments of my heart, I concerned myself very little in tracing\r\neither their cause or origin. Like me, my dear friend, you experienced,\r\nthough unconscious of it, that all-powerful charm, which gave up our\r\nwhole souls to the rapturous impression of tenderness, and neither of\r\nus recognised it to be love, till after the intoxication that deity\r\nplunged us into.\r\n\r\nBut that very circumstance is our exculpation, instead of our guilt.\r\nNo, you did not betray the rights of friendship, nor have I abused\r\nyour confidence. We both, it is true, were ignorant of our sentiments;\r\nbut we only underwent the delusion, without any efforts to give\r\nbirth to it: and far from complaining of it, let us only think of the\r\nhappiness it procured us, without disturbing it by unjust reproaches;\r\nlet our only endeavours be to farther augment it, by the pleasures of\r\nconfidence and entire security. O, my friend! how dear these hopes\r\nare to my heart! Yes, henceforward freed from all fears, and wholly\r\noccupied by love, you will participate of my desires, of my transports,\r\nof the sweet delirium of my senses, of the intoxication of my soul, and\r\neach moment of our happy days shall be marked by a new enjoyment.\r\n\r\nAdieu, thou whom I adore! I shall see thee this evening; but shall I\r\nfind you alone? I hardly dare to hope it. Ah! you do not desire it as\r\nmuch as I!\r\n\r\n_Paris, Dec._ 1, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CXLIX.\r\n\r\nMadame de Volanges _to_ Madame de Rosemonde.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was in hopes almost all day yesterday, to have been able to give you,\r\nmy worthy friend, this morning, a more favourable account of our dear\r\npatient; but since last night, that hope is utterly destroyed. A matter\r\nseemingly of very little importance, but which, in its consequences,\r\nproves to be a very unhappy one, has made the case at least as grievous\r\nas before, if not worse.\r\n\r\nI should not have had any comprehension of this sudden change, if I had\r\nnot received yesterday the entire confidence of our unhappy friend.\r\nAs she did not conceal from me that you also are acquainted with all\r\nher misfortunes, I can inform you every thing without reserve of her\r\nunhappy situation.\r\n\r\nYesterday morning, on my arrival at the convent, I was informed she had\r\nbeen asleep about three hours; and that sleep, so profound and so easy,\r\nI for some time was apprehensive was lethargic—Some time after she\r\nawoke, and opened the curtains of the bed herself.\r\n\r\nAt first she looked at us all with great surprise, and as I rose to go\r\nto her, she knew me, called me by my name, and begged I would come near\r\nher. She did not give me time to ask her any questions, but desired\r\nto know where she was; what we were doing there; if she was sick; and\r\nwhy she was not in her own house? I imagined at first, it was another\r\nfrenzy, only more gentle than the former: but I soon perceived she\r\nunderstood my replies perfectly; and she had recovered her reason, but\r\nnot her memory.\r\n\r\nShe questioned me very minutely on every thing that happened to her\r\nsince she came to the convent, which she did not remember. I gave her a\r\nfaithful account, only concealing what I thought might frighten her too\r\nmuch: and when I asked how she was, she replied she did not then feel\r\nany pain: but was much tormented during her sleep, and found herself\r\nfatigued. I advised her to keep quiet, and say little: then I partly\r\nclosed the curtains, and sat down by the side of her bed: some broth\r\nwas then proposed, which she agreed to take, and liked it very well.\r\n\r\nShe continued thus about half an hour, and only spoke to thank me for\r\nmy care of her, which she did with that graceful ease you know is so\r\nnatural to her; afterwards she was for some time quite silent, which\r\nshe broke at length, saying, “O yes, I now remember my coming here;”\r\nand a minute after, exclaimed grievously, “My dear friend, have pity\r\non me! My miseries are all returning on me.” I was then coming towards\r\nher, she grasped my hand, and leaning her head against it, “Great God!”\r\nsaid she, “cannot I then die!” Her expression more than her words\r\nmelted me into tears; she perceived it by my voice, and said, “you pity\r\nme then; ah, if you but knew!”—Then breaking off: “Let us be alone,\r\nand I will tell you all.”\r\n\r\nI believe I already wrote to you I had some suspicions, which I was\r\napprehensive would be the topic of this conversation that I foresaw\r\nwould be tedious and melancholy, and might probably be very detrimental\r\nto the present state of our unhappy friend. I endeavoured to dissuade\r\nher from it, by urging the necessity of repose; she however, insisted,\r\nand I was obliged to acquiesce.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we were alone, she acquainted me with every thing you\r\nalready know, therefore unnecessary to be repeated.\r\n\r\nAt last, relating the cruel manner in which she was sacrificed,\r\nshe added, “I was very certain it would be my death, and I was\r\nresolved—but it is impossible to survive my shame and grief.” I\r\nattempted to contend against this depression, or rather despair, with\r\nmotives of a religious nature, always hitherto so powerful in her mind;\r\nbut I was soon convinced I was not equal to this solemn function, and\r\nI determined to propose calling in Father Anselmus, in whom I knew she\r\nreposes great confidence. She consented, and even appeared much to\r\ndesire it—He was sent for, and came immediately: he stayed a long\r\ntime with her, and said, going away, if the physicians were of the same\r\nopinion he was, the ceremony of the sacraments he thought might be\r\npostponed until the day following.\r\n\r\nThis was about three in the afternoon, and our friend was pretty\r\nquiet until five, so that we all began to conceive some hope; but\r\nunfortunately a letter was then brought for her; when it was offered to\r\nher, she replied at first she would not receive any, and no one pressed\r\nit; but from that time she seemed more disturbed. Soon after she asked\r\nfrom whom the letter came?—It had no post-mark—Who brought it?—No\r\none knew—From what place did the messenger say it came?—The portress\r\nwas not informed. She remained silent some time after; then again began\r\nto speak; but her discourse was so incoherent, we were soon convinced\r\nthe frenzy was returned.\r\n\r\nHowever there was a quiet interval afterwards, until at last she\r\ndesired the letter should be given to her. The moment she cast her\r\neyes on it, she exclaimed, “Good God! from him!” and then in a strong\r\nand oppressed tone of voice, “Take it, take it.” She instantly ordered\r\nthe curtains of her bed to be closed, and desired no one should come\r\nnear her; but we were all soon obliged to come round her: the frenzy\r\nreturned with more violence than ever, accompanied with most dreadful\r\nconvulsions—Those shocking incidents continued the whole evening; and\r\nthe account I received this morning, informs me, the night has been no\r\nless turbulent. On the whole, I am astonished she has held out so long\r\nin the condition she is: and I will not conceal from you, that I have\r\nvery little, if any, hope of her recovery.\r\n\r\nI suppose this unfortunate letter is from M. de Valmont—What! can he\r\nstill dare to write to her! Forgive me, my dear friend; I must put a\r\nstop to my reflections—It is, however, a most cruel case, to see a\r\nwoman make so wretched an end, who has, until now, lived so happy, and\r\nwas so worthy being so.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Dec._ 2, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CL.\r\n\r\nChevalier Danceny _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn expectation of the happiness of seeing you, I indulge myself, my\r\ntender friend, in the pleasure of writing to you; and thus by occupying\r\nmyself with you, I dispel the gloom that otherwise would be occasioned\r\nby your absence. To delineate to you my sentiments, to recall yours\r\nto my mind, is a true enjoyment to my heart; and thus even the time\r\nof privation affords me a thousand ideas precious to my love—Yet,\r\nif I am to believe you, I shall not obtain any answer from you, even\r\nthis letter shall be the last, and we shall abandon a correspondence\r\nwhich, according to you, is dangerous, _and of which we have no\r\nneed_—Certainly I shall believe you if you persist; for what can\r\nyou desire that does not of course become my desire? But before you\r\nultimately decide upon it, will you not permit a slight conversation on\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nOf the head of danger you are the only judge—I can frame no\r\ncalculation of it—and I shall confine myself to requesting you would\r\nlook to your own safety, for I can have no tranquillity while you are\r\ndisquieted—As to this object, it is not we two that are but one, it is\r\nthou that art us both.\r\n\r\nAs to the matter of necessity, we can have but one thought; and if we\r\ndiffer in opinion, it can only rise from a want of proper explanation,\r\nor from not understanding one another. I shall therefore state to you\r\nwhat I think is my sensation.\r\n\r\nWithout doubt a letter appears very unnecessary when we can see one\r\nanother freely—What could it say that a word, or look, or even\r\nsilence itself, could not express? A hundred times before, this\r\nappeared to me so clear, that in the very moment that you spoke to me\r\nof not writing any more, that idea my mind immediately adopted—It was\r\na restraint upon it perhaps, but did not affect it—Thus, when I have\r\noffered a kiss upon your bosom, and found a ribband or piece of gauze\r\nin my way, I only turn it aside, and have not the least sentiment of an\r\nobstacle.\r\n\r\nBut since we have separated, and you are no longer there, this idea\r\nof correspondence by letters has returned to torment me—What is the\r\nreason, I have said to myself, of this additional privation? Why is it,\r\nbecause we are at some distance, we have nothing more to say to each\r\nother? Suppose that a fortunate concurrence of circumstances should\r\nbring us together for a day, shall we then employ in conversation the\r\ntime that ought to be wholly dedicated to enjoyment, which letters\r\nbetween us would prevent? I say enjoyment, my dear friend; for with you\r\nthe very moments of repose furnish, too, a delicious enjoyment; in a\r\nword, whenever such a happy opportunity offers, the conclusion is still\r\nseparation; and one is so solitary, it is then a letter becomes truly\r\nprecious: if not read, it is sure to be the only object that employs\r\nthe eye. Ah! there can be no doubt, but one may look at a letter\r\nwithout reading it; as I think that I even could have some pleasure at\r\nnight by barely touching your portrait.\r\n\r\nYour portrait have I said? but a letter is the portrait of the soul; it\r\nhas not, like a cold image, that degree of stagnation so opposite to\r\nlove; it yields to all our actions by turns; it becomes animated, gives\r\nus enjoyment, and sinks into repose—All your sentiments are precious\r\nto me; and will you deprive me of the means of becoming possessed of\r\nthem?\r\n\r\nAre you quite sure that a desire to write to me will never torment\r\nyou? If in the midst of your solitude your heart should be too much\r\ncompressed or desolated; if a joyous emotion should pass to your soul;\r\nif an involuntary sadness should disturb it for a moment, it would\r\nnot then be in the bosom of your friend that you would pour out your\r\nhappiness or distress; you would then have a sensation he should not\r\nshare; and you would punish him to wander in solitude and distrust far\r\nfrom you. My friend, my dearest friend! you are to pronounce—I have\r\nonly proposed to myself to discuss the question with you, and not to\r\nover-rule you—I have only offered you reasons—I dare hope I should\r\nhave stood on stronger ground if I had proceeded to entreaties—I\r\nshall endeavour, then, if you should persist, not to be afflicted; I\r\nshall use my efforts to tell myself what you would have wrote to me;\r\nbut you would tell it better than I, and I should have a much higher\r\ngratification in hearing it from you.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my charming friend! The hour approaches at last, when I shall\r\nbe able to see you: I fly from you with the more haste, in order the\r\nsooner to meet you again.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Dec._ 3, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLI.\r\n\r\n_The_ Viscount de Valmont _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nSurely, Marchioness, you do not take me to be such a novice, to\r\nimagine I could be duped in the tête-à-tête which I found you in this\r\nafternoon; or by the _astonishing chance_ that led Danceny to your\r\nhouse! Not but your well-practised countenance wonderfully assumed a\r\ncalm serenity of expression; or that you, by the most trifling word,\r\nbetrayed, which sometimes happens, the least disorder or uneasiness. I\r\nwill even allow your submissive looks served you eminently; and could\r\nthey have made themselves as well credited as readily understood, far\r\nfrom having or harbouring the least suspicion, I should not at all\r\nhave doubted the great vexation this _troublesome trio_ gave you.\r\nBut to display to greater advantage those extraordinary talents, to\r\nensure the success you promised yourself, to carry on the deception you\r\nintended, you should have formed your inexperienced lover with more\r\ncare.\r\n\r\nSince you have begun to educate youth, you should teach your pupils not\r\nto blush or be disconcerted at a little raillery; not to deny so warmly\r\nfor one woman, the same charge which they so faintly excuse themselves\r\nin for all others; teach them also to learn to hear encomiums on their\r\nmistress, without enhancing them.\r\n\r\nAnd if you permit them to fix their looks on you in the circle,\r\nlet them be taught to disguise that glance of enjoyment which is\r\nso easy to discover, and which they so unskilfully blend with the\r\nglance of love—Then you will be able to exhibit them in your public\r\nexercises, and their behaviour will not do any prejudice to their\r\nsage institutrix. Even myself, happy to be able to contribute to your\r\ncelebrity, will compose and publish the exercises to be performed in\r\nthis new college.\r\n\r\nBut I am astonished, I must own, that you should have undertaken to\r\ntreat me as a school-boy. O! with any other woman, what pleasure I\r\nshould have in being revenged! How transcendent it would be to that she\r\nshould think to deprive me of! Yes, it is for you alone I condescend to\r\ngive preference to satisfaction rather than revenge: and do not think I\r\nam restrained by the least doubt or uncertainty—I know all.\r\n\r\nYou have been in Paris now four days, and each day Danceny has been\r\nwith you, and you have not admitted any one but him—even this day\r\nyour door was still close; and had your porter’s assurance been\r\nequal to his mistress’s, I should not have seen you: yet you wrote me\r\nI might depend on being the first informed of your arrival. Of that\r\nsame arrival, the particular day of which could not be ascertained,\r\nalthough you was writing to me the eve of your departure—Can you deny\r\nthose facts, or will you attempt to excuse them? They are both equally\r\nimpossible; and still I keep my temper! Acknowledge here your power; be\r\nsatisfied to have experienced it, but do not any longer abuse it. We\r\nknow each other, Marchioness; that should be sufficient.\r\n\r\nTo-morrow you are to be out for the day you told me; be it so, if you\r\nreally go out, and you think I shall know it: but you will be home in\r\nthe evening; we shall not have too much time until the next day to\r\nsettle our difficult reconciliation. Let me know, then, if it will be\r\nat your house, _or yonder_, we shall make our numerous reciprocal\r\nexpiations. But no more of Danceny; your wrong head had filled itself\r\nwith his idea, and I am willing to overlook this delirium of your\r\nfancy; but remember, from this moment, that what was only a whim, would\r\nbecome a decided preference. I am not tempered for such an humiliation,\r\nneither do I expect to receive it from you.\r\n\r\nI even expect this sacrifice will be but trifling to you—If it should\r\nbe a little troublesome, I think, however, I have set you a tolerable\r\nexample! A sensible and lovely woman, who existed for me only, who,\r\nperhaps, at this instant, is expiring with love and grief, may well\r\nbe worth a young scholar, who, if you will, wants neither wit or\r\naccomplishments, but is deficient in consistency.\r\n\r\nAdieu, Marchioness! I say nothing of my sentiments for you; all I can\r\ndo at present is not to scrutinize my heart. I wait your answer.\r\nRemember, the easier it is for you to make me forget the injury you\r\nhave done me, the more a denial, even the least delay, would engrave it\r\nin indelible characters on my heart.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Dec._ 3, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLII.\r\n\r\n_The_ Marchioness de Merteuil _to the_ Viscount de Valmont.\r\n\r\n\r\nTake care, Viscount; have a little more regard for my extreme\r\ntimidity. How do you think I can support the unsufferable idea of your\r\nindignation; but especially that I do not sink under the terror of your\r\nvengeance? particularly as you know, if you defamed me, it would be\r\nimpossible for me to return the compliment. In vain should I babble;\r\nyour existence would nevertheless be brilliant and peaceful: for what\r\nwould you have to dread? Only to be under the necessity of retiring if\r\nyou had an opportunity. But could one not live in a foreign country as\r\nwell as here? And to sum up all, provided the court of France would\r\nlet you be quiet in the one you choose to settle in, it would be only\r\nchanging the field of your victories. After endeavouring to bring you\r\nback to your _sang froid_ by these moral considerations, let us resume\r\nour own affairs.\r\n\r\nYou do not know, Viscount, the reasons I never married again. It was\r\nnot, I assure you, for want of several advantageous matches being\r\noffered to me; it was solely that no one should have a right to\r\ncontrol me. It was not even a dread of not being able to pursue my\r\ninclinations, for certainly, at all events, that I should have done:\r\nbut it would have pained me if any one should even have a right to\r\ncomplain. On the whole, it was that I would not wish to deceive but for\r\nmy own pleasure, and not through necessity. And behold you write me the\r\nmost matrimonial letter it is possible to conceive! You tell me of the\r\ninjuries I have committed, and the favours you have granted! I cannot\r\nconceive how it is possible to be indebted to one where nothing is due.\r\n\r\nNow for the business. You found Danceny at my house, and you was\r\ndispleased; be it so: but what conclusion do you draw from thence? Why,\r\nthat it was the effect of chance, as I told you, or of my inclination,\r\nwhich I did not tell you. In the first instance, your letter is wrong;\r\nin the second, ridiculous. It was well worth the trouble of writing!\r\nBut you are jealous, and jealousy never debates. Well, I will argue\r\nfor you.\r\n\r\nYou have a rival, or you have not. If you have a rival, you must\r\nplease, to obtain the preference over him; and if you have none,\r\nyou must still please, to avoid having one. In all cases the same\r\ninvariable conduct must be observed. Why, then, will you torment\r\nyourself?—And why torment me? Have you, then, lost the secret of being\r\nthe most amiable? And are you no longer certain of your success? Come,\r\ncome, Viscount, you do yourself injustice. But that is not the case,\r\nfor I will not, even in your mind, have you give yourself so much\r\nuneasiness. You wish less for my condescension, than an opportunity\r\nof abusing your power. Fie! you are very ungrateful! I think this is\r\ntolerably sentimental; and was I to continue any time, this letter\r\nmight become very tender: but you don’t deserve it.\r\n\r\nNeither do you deserve I should enter farther in my justification. To\r\npunish you for your suspicions, you shall keep them; so that I shall\r\nmake no reply as to the time of my return, or Danceny’s visits. You\r\nhave taken great trouble to be informed of them, most certainly: and\r\npray what progress have you made by it? I hope you received great\r\npleasure from your enquiries; as to mine, it has not been in the least\r\ndetrimental to them.\r\n\r\nAll I can say, then, to your threatening letter is this—it has neither\r\nthe gift of pleasing, nor power to intimidate me; and that at this\r\npresent time I am not in the least disposed to grant your request.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, to receive you, as you exhibit yourself now, would be a\r\ndownright act of infidelity: it would not be a renewal with my former\r\nlover; it would be taking a new one, many degrees inferior to him. I\r\nhave not so soon forgot the first, to be deceived. The Valmont I loved\r\nwas a charming fellow. I will even own, I never met a more amiable man.\r\nI beg, Viscount, if you find him, to bring him to me, he will be always\r\nwell received.\r\n\r\nAcquaint him, however, that it cannot by any means be either to-day or\r\nto-morrow. His Menæchmus has done him some harm, and was I in too much\r\nhaste, I should dread a deception; or, perhaps, I have given my word to\r\nDanceny for those two days: moreover, your letter informs me you do not\r\njest; when one breaks their word, therefore, you see you must wait.\r\n\r\nThat is, however, of very little consequence, as you can always be\r\nrevenged on your rival. He will not treat your mistress worse than\r\nyou will his; and after all, is not one woman as good as another?\r\nThese are your own principles. Even she who should be _tender and\r\nsensible, who existed only for you, who was dying of love and grief,_\r\nwould nevertheless be sacrificed to the first whim, or the dread of\r\nbeing ridiculed for a moment; and yet you would have one constrain\r\nthemselves! Ah! that is not reasonable.\r\n\r\nAdieu, Viscount! become once more amiable. It is the utmost of my\r\nwishes to find you charming as ever. When I am certain of it, I engage\r\nto prove it to you—indeed, I am too good natured.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Dec._ 4, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLIII.\r\n\r\nViscount de Valmont _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nI reply to your letter on the instant, and will endeavour to be\r\nexplicit; which is not an easy matter with you, when you have once\r\ndetermined not to understand.\r\n\r\nMany words are not necessary to convince us, each has the power of\r\nruining the other; we have an equal interest to keep fair with one\r\nanother: that is not the business at present. But between the violent\r\ndetermination of destruction, and doubtless the more eligible one of\r\nbeing still united as hitherto, or of even being more so, by renewing\r\nour first attachment; between those two parties, I say, there are a\r\nthousand more to be taken. It was not, then, ridiculous to tell you,\r\nneither is it to repeat, that from this day I will either be your lover\r\nor your enemy.\r\n\r\nI am very sensible the choice will give you some uneasiness; that it\r\nwould be more convenient for you to shuffle. I am also satisfied, you\r\nnever liked to be confined to yes or no: but you must be sensible, I\r\ncannot let you from this small circle, without risking being deceived;\r\nand you ought to have foreseen, I would not bear it. You are now to\r\ndecide. I may leave you the choice, but will not remain in uncertainty.\r\n\r\nI only inform you beforehand, I will not be imposed on by your\r\narguments, good or bad; that I will no longer be seduced by any\r\nornamental wheedling with which you might embellish a refusal; and that\r\nthe hour of frankness is arrived. I wish for nothing more than to set\r\nyou the example; and I declare with pleasure, I prefer peace and union.\r\nIf it is necessary to break one or the other, I think I have the right\r\nand the means.\r\n\r\nTherefore I will add, the least obstacle you make, I shall consider as\r\na declaration of war. You will observe, the answer I demand does not\r\nrequire either long or studied sentences: two words will be sufficient.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Dec._ 4, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The answer of the Marchioness de Merteuil, wrote at the bottom of this\r\nsame letter._\r\n\r\nWar, then.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLIV.\r\n\r\nMadame de Volanges _to_ Madame de Rosemonde.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe journal will inform you much better than I can, my dear friend, the\r\nmelancholy state of our patient. Totally employed in my attendance on\r\nher, I have scarce time to write to you, as there are other matters to\r\nbe attended to as well as her disorder. Here is a specimen of one which\r\nmost certainly I did not in the least expect. I have received a letter\r\nfrom M. de Valmont, who has been pleased to choose me for a confidant,\r\nand even his mediatrix with Madame de Tourvel, to whom he wrote under\r\nmy cover. I returned the one when I answered the other. I transmit you\r\nmy answer; and I believe you will be of my opinion, that I neither\r\ncould or ought to have any thing to do with what he requests. Had I\r\nbeen even inclined to it, our unhappy friend was unable to understand\r\nme. Her frenzy is incessant. But what do you think of M. de Valmont’s\r\ndistraction? Is it real, or does he mean to deceive the world to the\r\nlast?[1]\r\n\r\nIf he is sincere this time, he may well say, he has made himself happy.\r\nI believe he will not be well pleased with my answer: but, I own, every\r\nthing that fixes my attention on this unhappy adventure, raises my\r\nresentment more and more against the author of it.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear friend! I must return to my melancholy employment,\r\nwhich becomes more so, by the small prospect there is of success. I\r\nneed not repeat my sentiments for you.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Dec._ 5, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Nothing having appeared in this correspondence that could resolve\r\nthis doubt, we chose to suppress Valmont’s letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLV.\r\n\r\n_The_ Viscount de Valmont _to the_ Chevalier Danceny.\r\n\r\n\r\nI called on you twice, my dear Chevalier; but since you have thrown\r\noff the character of a lover for the man of intrigue, you are very\r\nproperly invisible: however, your valet assured me you would be at\r\nhome to-night; that you had ordered him to expect you. I, who am well\r\nacquainted with your designs, immediately conjectured it would be but\r\nfor a short time for fashion’s sake, and that you would immediately\r\npursue your victorious career. Go on; I must applaud you: but,\r\nperhaps, you will be tempted to alter your course for this night. You\r\nare yet acquainted with only half your business; I must let you into\r\nthe other half, and then you will resolve. Take time, then, to read\r\nmy letter. It will not dissipate you from your enjoyments; on the\r\ncontrary, its object is to give you your choice.\r\n\r\nIf you had opened your mind confidentially to me; if you had told me\r\nthe part of your secrets you left me to guess at, I should with my\r\nzeal, and less awkwardness, have smoothed the path of your progression.\r\nBut let us set out from this point. Whatever resolution you take would,\r\nat worst, be the summit of good fortune to any one else.\r\n\r\nYou have a rendezvous for to-night: have you not? With a charming\r\nwoman, whom you adore? For at your age, where is the woman one does\r\nnot adore for, at least, the first eight days? The field of action\r\nshould also add greatly to your enjoyment—A delicious little villa,\r\n_which was taken for you only,_ must embellish voluptuousness with\r\nthe charms of mysteriousness and liberty. All is agreed on: you are\r\nexpected; and you are inflamed with desire to be there! All this we\r\nboth know, though you told me nothing of it. Now I will tell you what\r\nyou do not know; but you must be told.\r\n\r\nSince my return to Paris, I have been taken up with contriving the\r\nmeans of an interview between you and Mademoiselle de Volanges: I\r\npromised it; and when I last mentioned it to you, I had reason to\r\nexpect from your answer, I may say, from your transports, I was\r\nexerting myself in your happiness. I could not succeed alone in this\r\ndifficult undertaking: but after having settled every thing, I\r\nleft the rest with your young mistress. She found resources in her\r\naffection, resources which escaped my experience; after all, to your\r\ngreat misfortune she has succeeded. She told me this evening, for these\r\ntwo days past all obstacles are removed, and your happiness depends on\r\nyourself alone.\r\n\r\nShe flattered herself, also, for those two days, to have been able to\r\nsend you this news herself, and notwithstanding her mama’s absence\r\nyou would have been admitted: but you never once showed yourself! and\r\nI must farther tell you, whether from reason or capriciousness, the\r\nlittle thing did not seem pleased at your want of assiduity. At last\r\nshe found means to see me, and made me promise to deliver you the\r\nenclosed letter as soon as possible. From the eagerness she expressed,\r\nI would venture to lay a wager she gives you an assignation this\r\nnight; however, I promised her, upon honour and friendship, you should\r\nhave the tender summons in the course of the day, and neither can or\r\nwill break my word.\r\n\r\nNow, young gentleman, how will you behave in this business? Placed\r\nbetween coquetry and love, pleasure and happiness, which will you\r\nchoose? If I was writing to the Danceny of three months ago, or even\r\nthe Danceny of a week past, certain of the emotions of his heart, I\r\nshould be certain of his proceedings: but the Danceny of the day,\r\ncarried away by women, hunting after intrigue, and, according to\r\ncustom, a little profligate, will he prefer a timorous young girl, who\r\nhas nothing but beauty innocence, and love, to the allurements of a\r\ncommon _intriguer?_\r\n\r\nFor my part, my dear friend, I think, even in your new system, which,\r\nI confess, I am not much averse to, circumstances would decide the\r\npreference to the lover. First, it is an additional conquest, then\r\nthe novelty is attracting, and the fear of losing the fruits of your\r\naddresses, by neglecting to gather them; for to take it in this point\r\nof view, it would really be an opportunity missed, which is not always\r\nto be regained, especially in a first weakness: often in this case, a\r\nmoment of ill humour, a jealous suspicion, even less, may prevent the\r\nfinest conquest. Sinking virtue will sometimes grasp at a twig; and\r\nonce escaped, will be on its guard, and not easily surprised.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, you hazard nothing; not even a rupture; at most, a\r\nlittle quarrel: then your purchase with a little trouble the pleasure\r\nof a reconciliation; for what other resource has a woman you have\r\nalready enjoyed but compliance? What would she get by severity? The\r\nprivation of pleasure, without profit, for her glory.\r\n\r\nIf, as I suppose, you make love your choice, which appears to me,\r\nalso, that of reason, I think it would be more prudent not to send\r\nany apology for the disappointment of the rendezvous; leave her in\r\nexpectancy; for if you venture to give a reason, she will, perhaps,\r\nbe tempted to dive into the truth. Women are curious and obstinate.\r\nAll may be discovered: I myself, you see, am now an example of this\r\ntruth. But if you let her remain in hope, which will be supported by\r\nvanity, it will not be lost until a long time after the proper hour for\r\ninformation is over; then to-morrow you will have time to choose the\r\ninsurmountable obstacle that detained you: you may have been sick, dead\r\nif necessary, or any thing else that has almost made you frantic, and\r\nall will be made up.\r\n\r\nBut which ever side you incline to, I only beg you will inform me; and\r\nas I am totally unconcerned, I will always think you have done right.\r\nAdieu, my dear friend!\r\n\r\nAll I have to add is, I regret M. de Tourvel. I am in a state of\r\ndesperation at being separated from her; and I would lay down one\r\nhalf my life, to devote the other to her. Ah! believe me, there is no\r\nfelicity but in love.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Dec._ 5, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLVI.\r\n\r\nCecilia Volanges _to the_ Chevalier Danceny.\r\n\r\n(_Annexed to the former._)\r\n\r\n\r\nHow happens it, my dear friend, I no longer see you; although I never\r\ncease wishing for it? Your inclinations then, are no longer like\r\nmine! Ah, it is now I am truly sorrowful! More so, than when we were\r\ntotally separate. The affliction I was used to receive from others, now\r\nproceeds from you, which is more insupportable.\r\n\r\nFor some days past, mama is never at home, and you know it—I flattered\r\nmyself you would have taken the opportunity; but you do not at all\r\nthink of me—I am very unhappy—How often have you told me, I did not\r\nlove as much as you did—I was certain it was otherwise, and am now\r\nconvinced. Had you called, you might have seen me; for I am not like\r\nyou; I think of nothing but how to contrive to see you—You deserve I\r\nshould not tell you all I have done: but I love you so much, and have\r\nso strong a desire to see you, I can’t help telling you, and then I\r\nshall see if you really love me.\r\n\r\nI have secured the porter, and he has promised every time you come no\r\none shall see you; and we may confide in him, for he is a very honest\r\nman. There is then no other difficulty to prevent any one in the house\r\nseeing you, and that will be very easy to do; it is only to come at\r\nnight; then there will be no danger at all—for since mama goes out\r\nevery day, she always goes to bed at eleven; so that we shall have a\r\ngreat deal of time.\r\n\r\nThe porter told me when you had a mind to come this way, instead\r\nof knocking at the door, you need only tap at the window, and he\r\nwould open the door directly, and then you can readily find the\r\n_back-stairs_—As you will not have any light, I will leave my chamber\r\ndoor open, which will give you some little. You must take great care\r\nnot to make any noise, particularly passing by mama’s little door.\r\nAs to my waiting maid’s room, it is of no signification, for she has\r\npromised me not to be awake; and she is also a very good girl! When you\r\nare going away it will be the same thing—Now we shall see whether you\r\nwill come.\r\n\r\nO, Lord! I don’t know why my heart beats so while I am writing to you!\r\nIs it the fore-runner of any misfortune, or is it the hope of seeing\r\nyou that makes me thus? This I know, I never loved you so much, and\r\nnever so much wished to tell you so. Come, then, my dear, dear friend,\r\nthat I may a thousand times repeat I love you—I adore you, and never\r\nwill love any but you.\r\n\r\nI found a method to inform M. de Valmont I wanted to see him, and\r\nhad something to say to him; and as he is our very good friend, will\r\ncome to-morrow certainly. I will beg of him to give you my letter\r\nimmediately—That I shall expect you to-morrow night, and you will\r\nnot fail to come, if you have not a mind to make your Cecilia very\r\nmiserable.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear friend! I embrace you with all my heart.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Dec._ 4, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLVII.\r\n\r\n_The_ Chevalier Danceny _to the_ Viscount de Valmont.\r\n\r\n\r\nDoubt neither the emotions of my heart, or my proceedings, my dear\r\nViscount—Is it possible I could resist a wish of my Cecilia’s? Ah! it\r\nis she, and she alone, I will ever love! Her openness, her tenderness,\r\nhave fixed such a spell over me, that nothing can ever efface, although\r\nI have been weak enough to suffer a distraction. Imperceptibly, I may\r\nsay, engaged in another adventure, the remembrance of Cecilia has\r\ndisturbed me in the tenderest moments; and perhaps my heart never\r\nrendered her a more faithful homage, than at the instant I was\r\nunfaithful to her. However, my dear friend, let us spare her delicacy,\r\nand hide my fault; not to deceive, but only not to afflict her.\r\nCecilia’s happiness is the most ardent wish of my heart; and I should\r\nnever forgive myself a fault which should cost her a tear.\r\n\r\nI feel I deserved the banter you pass upon me, relative to what you\r\ncall my new system: but I beg you will be assured, I am not led by them\r\nat this time; I am resolved to prove it to-morrow—I will go and accuse\r\nmyself even to her who has been the cause and partner of my error—I\r\nwill tell her; “read my heart; there you will see the tenderest\r\nfriendship; friendship united to desire so much resembles love! We\r\nhave both been deceived; but although liable to error, I am incapable\r\nof deceit.” I know my friend well; she has probity, and is gentle; she\r\nwill do more than pardon, she will approve my conduct; she has often\r\nreproached herself for having betrayed friendship: her delicacy has\r\noften alarmed her love: more considerate than me, she will strengthen\r\nmy mind with those useful apprehensions which I rashly endeavoured to\r\nstifle in hers—I shall owe my reformation to her, and my felicity to\r\nyou. O, my friends! partake my gratitude: the idea of being indebted to\r\nyou for my happiness, augments its value.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear Viscount! the excess of my joy does not prevent me from\r\nthinking and sharing your troubles. Why can I not serve you? M. de\r\nTourvel still remains inexorable then! It is said she is very ill—May\r\nshe at once recover health and condescension, and for ever make you\r\nhappy! They are the vows of friendship; and I dare hope will be granted\r\nby love.\r\n\r\nI would write some time longer, but time presses, and perhaps Cecilia\r\nalready expects me.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Dec._ 5, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLVIII.\r\n\r\n_The_ Viscount de Valmont _to the_ Marchioness de Merteuil.\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, Marchioness, how are you after the pleasures of last night? Are\r\nyou not a little fatigued? You must acknowledge Danceny is a charming\r\nfellow! That lad is a prodigy! You did not expect such things from\r\nhim; is it not true? I must do myself justice; such a rival deserved\r\nI should be sacrificed to him. Seriously he has a number of good\r\nqualities! So much love, so much constancy, so much delicacy! Ah! if\r\never he loves you as he does his Cecilia, you will have no occasion to\r\ndread being rivalled; he has proved it this night. Perhaps through dint\r\nof coquetry, another woman may entice him for a short time; a young man\r\nhardly knows how to resist incitements; but you see a single word from\r\nthe beloved object is sufficient to dissipate the illusion; so that\r\nthere is nothing wanting to complete your happiness, but being that\r\nbeloved object.\r\n\r\nCertainly you will not be mistaken; you have such exquisite feeling\r\nit is not to be apprehended: yet the friendship that unites us, as\r\nsincere on my side as acknowledged on yours, made me wish you should\r\nexperience the proof of this night; it is an effort of my zeal—It has\r\nsucceeded—But no acknowledgements—it is not worth while—nothing more\r\neasy.\r\n\r\nBut to the point; what did it cost me? Why a slight sacrifice, and a\r\nlittle address. I consented to share with the young man the favours\r\nof his mistress; but he had as great a right to them as I had, and I\r\nwas not in the least uneasy about them. The letter the young creature\r\nwrote him, I dictated; but it was only to gain a little time, as we\r\ncould employ it to so much better purpose. What I wrote with it was\r\nnothing, almost nothing. Some few friendly reflections to direct the\r\nnew lover; but upon honour they were useless—To tell the truth, he did\r\nnot hesitate a moment. Moreover, he is to wait on you to-day to relate\r\nall; and it certainly will give you great pleasure! He will tell you,\r\n_read my heart,_ so he writes me; and you see that I will settle every\r\nthing. I hope that in reading what he pleases, you will also perhaps\r\nread, that such young lovers are dangerous—and also, that it is better\r\nto have me for a friend than an enemy.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Dec._ 6, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLIX.\r\n\r\n_The_ Marchioness de Merteuil _to the_ Viscount de Valmont.\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not like to have scurvy jests added to bad actions; it is not\r\nagreeable to my taste or manner. When I have cause of complaint against\r\na person, I do not ridicule, I do better; I take revenge. However well\r\npleased you may be with yourself now, do not forget it is not the first\r\ntime you have applauded yourself beforehand; and singular, in the\r\nhope of a triumph that would escape from you, at the instant you was\r\ncongratulating yourself on it. Adieu.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Dec._ 6, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLX.\r\n\r\nMadame de Volanges _to_ Madame de Rosemonde.\r\n\r\n\r\nI write this from the chamber of your unhappy friend, whose state\r\nis pretty much the same: there is to be a consultation held this\r\nafternoon, of four physicians—I need not tell you this resource is\r\noftener a proof of the danger than the means of relief.\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems her head is something better since last night—her\r\nwaiting maid told me this morning, her mistress ordered her to be\r\ncalled about twelve: she desired they should be left alone, and\r\ndictated a pretty long letter—Julie adds, while she was folding it,\r\nMadame Tourvel was attacked with her delirium, so that the girl did\r\nnot know who to direct it to. I was at first surprised the letter\r\nitself was not sufficient to inform her; but telling me she was afraid\r\nof committing a mistake, and that her mistress had ordered her to send\r\nit away immediately, I took it upon me to open it.\r\n\r\nThere I found the enclosed writing, which is certainly not addressed\r\nto any body, being addressed to too many—Yet, I believe, our\r\nunhappy friend at first intended it for M. de Valmont, but gave way\r\nimperceptibly, to her disordered ideas. However, I thought it ought not\r\nto be sent to any one—I send it you, as you will see better than I can\r\ntell you, the thoughts that engage the head of our patient. Whilst she\r\ncontinues so intensely affected, I shall have very little hopes—the\r\nbody seldom recovers when the mind is so agitated.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear and worthy friend! I am happy you are far from the\r\ndismal spectacle I have incessantly before my eyes.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Dec._ 6, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXI.\r\n\r\n_The_ Presidente de Tourvel.\r\n\r\n(_Dictated by her, and wrote by her waiting maid._)\r\n\r\n\r\nCruel and mischievous being! will thou never be tired persecuting\r\nme? Is it not enough to have tormented, degraded, abased? Will\r\nthou then rob me of the peaceful tomb? In the gloom of this abode,\r\nwhere shame has drove me to bury myself, are my sufferings to have\r\nno respite; is hope to be for ever banished? I do not require a\r\nfavour I am undeserving of: I shall suffer without complaint, if my\r\nsufferings do not exceed my strength: but do not make my torments\r\ninsupportable—Leave me my sorrows, and take away the cruel remembrance\r\nof the advantages I have lost. Although thou hast ravished them from\r\nme, do not again draw the afflicting picture of them—I was happy and\r\ninnocent—I gazed on thee and lost my peace—I listened to thee and was\r\nguilty—Thou cause of all my crimes, who gave thee authority to punish\r\nthem?\r\n\r\nWhere are now the friends to whom I was dear? My misfortunes have\r\nfrightened them—No one dares come near me—I am oppressed and left\r\nwithout relief—I die and no one weeps over me—I am debarred of every\r\nconsolation—Pity stops on the brink of the abyss where the criminal\r\nplunges—remorse tears my heart, and its cries are not heard.\r\n\r\nAnd thou who I have injured; thou, whose esteem adds to my\r\ntorment—thou who only hast a right to revenge; why art thou far\r\nfrom me? Come, punish a faithless woman—Let me suffer the tortures\r\nI deserve—I should have already bowed to thy vengeance, but wanted\r\ncourage to inform thee of thy shame; it was not dissimulation, it was\r\nrespect. Let this letter at least acquaint thee with my repentance.\r\nHeaven has taken thy cause in hand, to punish an injury to which thou\r\nwast a stranger—It was heaven tied my tongue—It was heaven prevented\r\nmy design, lest you should pardon a crime it was resolved to punish—It\r\nsnatched me from thy commiseration, which would have opposed its\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nBut unmerciful in its vengeance, it delivered me up to him who ruined\r\nme; at once to make me suffer for him and by him. In vain I strive to\r\nfly from him; still he follows me—he is there; incessantly he besets\r\nme—How different from himself! His eyes show nothing but hatred and\r\ncontempt—His lips utter insult and reproach—His arms surround me only\r\nto destroy me—Is there no one will save me from his savage rage?\r\n\r\nHow! It is he! I am not deceiv’d; it is he I see again—Oh, my lovely\r\nfriend! receive me in thy tender arms; hide me in thy bosom! It is\r\nthee; yes, it is thyself—What fatal illusion deceived me? Ah, how have\r\nI suffered during thy absence—Let us part no more: let us never part.\r\nLet me breathe—Feel my heart, how it beats! Ah! it is no longer with\r\nfear, it is the soft emotion of love; why refuse my tender caresses?\r\nTurn thy languishing eyes towards me—What are those bands you want to\r\nbreak? Why those solemn preparations for death? What can thus alter\r\nthy countenance? Leave me! I shudder! O, God! This monster again! My\r\ndear friends, do not abandon me—You that wanted me to avoid him; help\r\nme to resist him—And you more lenient, who promised to soften my\r\nsorrows, why do not you come to me? Where are you both? If I must no\r\nlonger see you, at least answer this letter, let me hear you still love\r\nme.\r\n\r\nLeave me, then, cruel man! What new transport inspires thee? Art\r\nthou afraid a soft sentiment should invade me? thou redoublest my\r\ntorments—You will force me to hate you—O, how painful is hatred!\r\nhow it corrodes the heart from whence it is distilled! Why will you\r\npersecute me? What can you have more to say to me? Have you not made it\r\nimpossible for me either to hear or answer you. Farewell.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Dec._ 6, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXII.\r\n\r\nChevalier Danceny _to the_ Viscount de Valmont.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am informed, Sir, of your behaviour towards me—I also know that\r\nafter having basely sported with me, you have dared to applaud yourself\r\nand brag of it—The proof of your treachery I have seen under your\r\nhand—I cannot help acknowledging my heart was pierced, and I felt\r\nsome shame at having myself so much assisted in the odious abuse you\r\nmade of my blind confidence: still I do not envy you this shameful\r\nadvantage—I am only curious to know, whether you will equally preserve\r\nthem all over me—This I shall be informed of, if, as I hope, you will\r\nbe to-morrow morning, between eight and nine, at the gate of the wood\r\nof Vincennes, village of St. Maude. I will take care to provide every\r\nthing necessary for the eclaircissement, which remains for me to take\r\nwith you.\r\n\r\n             _The Chevalier_ Danceny.\r\n_Paris, Dec._ 6, _at night_, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXIII.\r\n\r\nM. Bertrand _to_ Madame de Rosemonde.\r\n\r\n\r\nMadam,\r\n\r\nIt is with the greatest grief I find myself obliged to fulfil my duty,\r\nby giving you an intelligence that will cause you so much affliction.\r\nPermit me first to recommend the exertion of that pious resignation\r\nwhich every one has so often admired in you, and which alone can\r\nsupport us among the evils of this miserable life.\r\n\r\nM. your nephew—Good God! must I afflict so respectable a lady! M. your\r\nnephew, had the misfortune to fall this morning in a duel he fought\r\nwith M. the Chevalier Danceny. I am entirely unacquainted with the\r\ncause of the quarrel: but it appears, by the note which I found in M.\r\nthe Viscount’s pocket, and which I have the honour to send you; it\r\nappears, I say, he was not the aggressor: and yet heaven permitted him\r\nto fall!\r\n\r\nI was at M. the Viscount’s, waiting for him, at the very time he was\r\nbrought back to his hotel. You cannot conceive the shock I received,\r\nseeing M. your nephew brought in by two of his servants, bathed in\r\nblood. He had two thrusts of a sword in his body, and was very weak.\r\nM. Danceny was also there, and even wept. Ah! certainly he ought to\r\nweep—it is a pretty time to cry when one has been the cause of an\r\nirreparable misfortune!\r\n\r\nFor my part, I could not contain myself; and notwithstanding my\r\ninsignificancy, I could not help telling him my thoughts. But it was\r\nthen M. the Viscount showed himself truly great: he commanded me to\r\nhold my tongue; and he even took his murderer by the hand, called him\r\nhis friend, embraced him before us three, and said to us, “I command\r\nyou to have for this gentleman all the respect that is due to a brave\r\nand gallant man.” Moreover, he ordered to be given him, in my presence,\r\nsome very voluminous papers, that I know nothing of, but which I know\r\nhe set a value on. Then he desired they should be left together for\r\na little while; however, I sent immediately for assistance, as well\r\nspiritual as temporal: but, alas! the evil was without remedy. In less\r\nthan half an hour after, M. the Viscount was insensible. He could only\r\nreceive the extreme unction; and the ceremony was scarcely over, before\r\nhe breathed his last.\r\n\r\nGreat God! when I received in my arms at his birth this precious prop\r\nof so illustrious a family, could I ever have thought he would expire\r\nin my arms, and that I should deplore his death! A death so sudden,\r\nand so unfortunate—my tears flow in spite of me. I ask pardon, Madam,\r\nfor taking the liberty of mingling my sorrows with yours: but in every\r\nstation, tenderness and sensibility will operate; and I should be very\r\nungrateful if I did not lament, during my life, a nobleman who was so\r\nkind, and placed such a confidence in me.\r\n\r\nTo-morrow, when the body will be removed, I will order every thing\r\nto be sealed, and you may depend on my care entirely in every thing.\r\nI need not inform you, Madam, this unhappy event puts an end to the\r\nentail, and leaves you entirely at liberty. If I can be of any service,\r\nI beg, Madam, you will give me your orders, which will be executed with\r\nthe greatest zeal and utmost punctuality.\r\n\r\nI am, with the most profound respect, Madam, your most humble Bertrand.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Dec._ 7, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXIV.\r\n\r\nMadame de Rosemonde _to_ M. Bertrand.\r\n\r\n\r\nI this instant received your letter, my dear Bertrand, informing\r\nme of the shocking event, to which my nephew is become the unhappy\r\nvictim—yes, undoubtedly, I shall have orders to give you; and it\r\nis they only can take off my thoughts a while from this afflicting\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\nM. Danceny’s challenge, which you sent me, is a convincing proof he\r\nwas the aggressor; my intention therefore is, you should commence a\r\nprosecution in my name: for although my nephew, in compliance with his\r\nnatural generosity, may have pardoned his enemy, his murderer, I ought\r\nto avenge at once his death, religion, and humanity. One cannot excite\r\ntoo much the severity of the laws against those remains of barbarism\r\nwhich still infect our morals; and I do not believe, in such cases, the\r\nforgiveness of injuries can be commanded us; therefore I expect you\r\nwill prosecute this business with all that zeal and activity of which I\r\nknow you so capable, and which you owe to my nephew’s memory.\r\n\r\nBut first, take care to confer with M. the President —— from me.\r\nI do not write to him, as I am so overwhelmed with grief. You will,\r\ntherefore, apologise for me, and communicate this to him.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear Bertrand! I am well pleased with your conduct, and thank\r\nyou for your good inclinations, and am your sincere friend.\r\n\r\n_Castle of ——, Dec._ 8, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXV.\r\n\r\nMadame de Volanges _to_ Madame de Rosemonde.\r\n\r\n\r\nI know you are already informed, my dear and worthy friend, of the\r\nloss you have sustained. I know the tender affection you had for M.\r\nde Valmont, and I most sincerely partake of the affliction you must\r\nendure. I am truly grieved to add new griefs to those you have already\r\nexperienced: but, alas! nothing now can be done for our unhappy friend\r\nbut to deplore her fate. We lost her at eleven o’clock last night. By\r\na fatality linked to her fate, and which seemed to baffle all human\r\nprudence, this short interval that she survived M. de Valmont was\r\nsufficient to inform her of his death, and, as she said herself, not\r\nbe able to sink under the weight of her miseries until their measure\r\nwas filled.\r\n\r\nYou already know, that for these two days she was\r\ninsensible;—yesterday morning, when her physician came, and we drew\r\nnear her bed, she did not know either of us, and we could not obtain\r\na word or a sign. We were scarcely returned to the fire, while the\r\nphysician was relating to me the melancholy event of M. de Valmont’s\r\ndeath, but this unhappy woman recovered her reason: whether nature\r\nalone produced this revolution, or whether it was occasioned by the\r\nfrequent repetition of the words, M. de Valmont and death, which may\r\nhave recalled the only ideas with which her mind had been so long\r\nengaged.\r\n\r\nBe it what it may, she suddenly drew back the curtain of the bed,\r\nexclaiming, “What! What do you say? M. de Valmont dead!” I hoped to\r\nmake her believe she was mistaken. At first I endeavoured to persuade\r\nher she did not hear well: but all in vain; for she insisted the\r\nphysician should begin the cruel tale again;—on my endeavouring to\r\ndissuade her from it, she called me to her, saying, in a low voice,\r\n“Why will you deceive me? Was he not already dead to me?” I then was\r\nforced to acquiesce.\r\n\r\nOur unhappy friend appeared at first to listen to the story with great\r\ntranquillity: but she soon interrupted him, saying, “Enough; I know\r\nenough:” and immediately ordered her curtains to be closed—When the\r\nphysician went to perform the duties of his office, she never would\r\nsuffer him to come near her.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was gone, she also sent away her nurse and her waiting\r\nmaid. When we were alone, she requested I would assist her to kneel\r\non her bed, and support her. Then she remained some time silent;—and\r\nwithout any other expression than her tears, which flowed most\r\nabundantly, joining her hands, and raising them towards heaven;\r\n“Almighty God!” said she in a weak but fervent tone, “I submit to\r\nthy just judgment: but in thy mercy forgive Valmont. Let not my\r\nmisfortunes, which I acknowledge, be laid to his charge, and I shall\r\nbless thy mercy!” I could not avoid, my dear and worthy friend,\r\ngoing into those digressions on a subject I am sensible must renew\r\nand aggravate your sorrows, as I am certain this prayer of Madame de\r\nTourvel’s will give you much consolation.\r\n\r\nAfter our friend had uttered those few words she fell in my arms;\r\nand she was scarcely settled in her bed, when she fainted for a\r\nconsiderable time, and recovered with the usual helps. As soon as she\r\ncame to herself, she begged I would send for Father Anselmus, saying,\r\n“He is the only physician I have now occasion for. I feel my miseries\r\nwill soon be at end.” She complained of a great oppression, and spoke\r\nwith great difficulty.\r\n\r\nSome time after, she ordered her waiting maid to give me a little box,\r\nwhich I send you, that contains papers belonging to her, and charged me\r\nto send them to you immediately after her death.[1] Then she conversed\r\nabout you, of your friendship for her, as much as her situation would\r\npermit, and with great tenderness.\r\n\r\nFather Anselmus came about four o’clock, and stayed near an hour alone\r\nwith her. When we returned, her countenance was calm and serene, but\r\nit was easily to be seen Father Anselmus had wept a great deal. He\r\nremained to assist at the last ceremonies of the church. This solemn\r\nand melancholy sight became more so by the contrast of the composed\r\nand settled resignation of the sick person, with the silent grief of\r\nthe venerable confessor, who was dissolved in tears beside her. The\r\nafflicting scene became general, and she who we all deplored was the\r\nonly one unmoved.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the day was spent in the usual prayers, which was now\r\nand then interrupted by the frequent faintings of the dear woman. At\r\nlast, about eleven, she seemed more in pain, with great oppression. I\r\nput out my hand to feel her arm; she had still strength to place it on\r\nher heart; I could no longer feel it beat, and, indeed, our unhappy\r\nfriend expired instantly.\r\n\r\nYou may remember, my dear friend, when you last came to town, about\r\na year ago, chatting together about some people whose happiness then\r\nappeared to us more or less complete, we indulged ourselves in the\r\nthought of this same woman’s felicity, whose misfortune we now lament.\r\nSuch an assemblage of virtues! so many attractions and accomplishments!\r\nso sweet, so amiable! a husband she loved, and by whom she was adored!\r\na circle of friends, in whom she delighted, and was the delight! a\r\nfigure, youth, fortune! so many united advantages are lost by one act\r\nof imprudence! O, Providence! how incomprehensible and adorable are thy\r\ndecrees!—I fear I shall increase your sorrow by giving way to my own,\r\nand therefore will no longer dwell on the melancholy theme.\r\n\r\nMy daughter is a little indisposed. On hearing from me this morning\r\nthe sudden death of two persons of her acquaintance, she was taken\r\nill, and I ordered her to be put to bed. I hope, however, this slight\r\ndisorder will not be attended with any bad consequence. At her age they\r\nare not accustomed to such chagrines, and they leave a more lively and\r\nstronger impression. This active sensibility is certainly a laudable\r\nquality. What we daily see ought to make us dread it. Adieu, my dear\r\nand worthy friend!\r\n\r\n_Paris, Dec._ 9, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] This box contained all the letters relative to her adventure with\r\nM. de Valmont.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXVI.\r\n\r\nM. Bertrand _to_ Madame de Rosemonde.\r\n\r\n\r\nMadam,\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the orders you honoured me with, I waited on M. the\r\nPresident de ——, and communicated your letter to him, informing him\r\nat the same time, as you desired, I should do nothing without his\r\nadvice. This respectable magistrate commanded me to observe to you,\r\nthe prosecution you intended against M. the Chevalier Danceny would\r\nequally affect the memory of Monsieur your nephew, and his honour would\r\nnecessarily be tainted by the decree of the court; which would be,\r\ndoubtless, a very great misfortune. His opinion is, then, that you\r\ndo not make any stir about the matter: but, on the contrary, that you\r\nshould endeavour as much as possible to prevent the public officers\r\nfrom taking cognisance of this unfortunate business, which has already\r\nmade too much noise.\r\n\r\nThese observations, so replete with wisdom, oblige me to wait your\r\nfarther orders.\r\n\r\nPermit me, Madam, to request, when you honour me with them, you will\r\nmention a word concerning your state of health, which, I dread much, so\r\nmany crosses have impaired.\r\n\r\nI hope you will pardon the liberty I take, as it proceeds from my zeal\r\nand attachment.\r\n\r\n                         I am, with great respect, Madam, your, &c.\r\n_Paris, Dec._ 10, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXVII.\r\n\r\nAnonymous _to the_ Chevalier Danceny.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI have the honour to inform you, your late affair with M. the Viscount\r\nde Valmont was this morning much talked of among the King’s counsel\r\nwithin the bar, and that it is much to be feared the public officers\r\nwill commence a prosecution. I thought this notice might be of service,\r\neither to set your friends at work, to stop the bad consequences,\r\nor, in case you could not succeed, to take every precaution for your\r\npersonal security.\r\n\r\nIf you would permit me to add a piece of advice, I think you would\r\ndo well, for some time at least, not to appear so much in public as\r\nyou have done for some days—Although the world generally have great\r\nindulgence for those kind of affairs, yet there is a respect due to the\r\nlaws which ought to be observed.\r\n\r\nThis precaution appears to me the more necessary, that I recollect a\r\nMadame de Rosemonde, who, I am told, is M. de Valmont’s aunt, intended\r\nto prosecute you; if so, the courts could not refuse her petition: it\r\nwould perhaps be proper application should be made to this lady.\r\n\r\nParticular reasons prevent me from signing this letter; but I hope,\r\nthough ignorant from whom it comes, you will nevertheless do justice to\r\nthe sentiment that has dictated it.\r\n\r\n                         I have the honour to be, &c.\r\n_Paris, Dec._ 10, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXVIII.\r\n\r\nMadame de Volanges _to_ Madame de Rosemonde.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are, my dear and worthy friend, the strangest and most sad\r\nreports spread here, on account of Madam de Merteuil. I am certainly\r\nfar from giving any credit to them; and I would venture to lay a\r\nwager, they are horrible slanders; but I know too well, how the most\r\nimprobable wickedness readily gains credit; and how difficult it is\r\nto wipe away the impression they leave, not to be alarmed at those,\r\nthough I think them so easy to be refuted. I wish, especially, they\r\nmight be stopped in time, and before they spread abroad; but I did not\r\nknow until late yesterday, the horrible things that are given out; and\r\nwhen I sent this morning to Madame de Merteuil’s, she was just then set\r\nout for the country for a couple of days—I could not learn where she\r\nwas gone; her second woman, who I sent for, told me, her mistress had\r\nonly given her orders to expect her on Thursday next; and none of her\r\nservants she left behind her knew any thing. I cannot even think where\r\nshe can be; as I do not recollect any of her acquaintance who stay so\r\nlate in the country.\r\n\r\nHowever, you will be able, I hope, to procure for me, between this and\r\nher return, some eclaircissements that may be useful to her; for these\r\nodious stories are founded on circumstances attendant on the death of\r\nM. de Valmont, of which you will probably have been informed, if there\r\nbe any truth in them; or you can at least readily receive information,\r\nwhich I particularly request you to do—This is what is published, or\r\nat least whispered as yet, but will not certainly fail to blaze out\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nIt is said the quarrel between M. de Valmont and Chevalier Danceny,\r\nis the work of Madame de Merteuil, who deceived them both; and, as it\r\nalways happens, the rivals began by fighting, and did not come to an\r\neclaircissement until after, which produced a sincere reconciliation:\r\nand in order to make M. de Merteuil known to Chevalier Danceny,\r\nand also in his own justification, M. de Valmont had added to his\r\nintelligence, a heap of letters, forming a regular correspondence which\r\nhe had kept up with her; in which she relates, in the loosest manner,\r\nthe most scandalous anecdotes of herself.\r\n\r\nIt is added, that Danceny in his first rage gave those letters to\r\nwhoever had a mind to see them; and that now they are all over\r\nParis—Two of them in particular, are quoted[1]; in one of which,\r\nshe gives a full history of her life and principles, which are said\r\nto be the most shocking imaginable—the other contains an entire\r\njustification of M. de Prevan, whose story you may recollect, by the\r\nproofs it gives, that he did nothing but acquiesce in the most pointed\r\nadvances M. de Merteuil made him, and the rendezvous agreed on with her.\r\n\r\nBut I have fortunately the strongest reasons to believe those\r\nimputations as false as they are odious. First, we both know that M. de\r\nValmont was not engaged about Madame de Merteuil; and I have all the\r\nreason in the world to think, Danceny was as far from thinking of her:\r\nso that I think it is demonstrable, that she could not be either the\r\ncause or object of the quarrel. Neither can I comprehend what interest\r\nM. de Merteuil could have, who is supposed to be combined with M. de\r\nPrevan, to act a part which must be very disagreeable, by the noise it\r\nwould occasion, and might be very dangerous for her, because she would\r\nthereby make an irreconcileable enemy of a man who was in possession of\r\na part of her secrets, and who had then many partizans.—Still it is\r\nobservable, since that adventure, not a single voice has been raised in\r\nfavour of Prevan, and that even there has not been the least objection\r\nmade on his side since.\r\n\r\nThose reflections would induce me to suspect him to be the author of\r\nthe reports that are now spread abroad, and to look on those enormities\r\nas the work of the revenge and hatred of a man who, finding himself\r\nlost in the opinion of the world, hopes, by such means, at least to\r\nraise doubts, and perhaps make a useful diversion in his favour; but\r\nwhatever cause they may proceed from, the best way will be to destroy\r\nsuch abominable tales as soon as possible; they would have dropped\r\nof themselves, if it should happen, as is very probable, that M. de\r\nValmont and Danceny did not speak to each other after their unhappy\r\naffair, and that there had been no papers given.\r\n\r\nBeing impatient to be satisfied as to the truth of those facts, I sent\r\nthis morning to M, Danceny’s; he is not in Paris either; his servants\r\ntold my valet de chambre, he had set out last night, on some advice he\r\nhad received yesterday, and the place of his residence was a secret;\r\nprobably he dreads the consequence of his affair; it is only from\r\nyou then, my dear and worthy friend, I can learn such interesting\r\nparticulars, that may be necessary for M. de Merteuil—I renew my\r\nrequest, and beg you will send them to me as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nP. S. My daughter’s indisposition had no bad consequences. She presents\r\nher respects.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Dec._ 11, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Letters lxxxi and lxxxv.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXIX.\r\n\r\n_The_ Chevalier Danceny _to_ Madame de Rosemonde.\r\n\r\n\r\nMadam,\r\n\r\nYou will perhaps think the step I now take very extraordinary; but\r\nI beseech you to hear before you condemn me, and do not look for\r\neither audacity or rashness, where there is nothing but respect and\r\nconfidence. I will not dissemble the injury I have done you; and during\r\nmy whole life I should never forgive myself, if I could for one moment\r\nthink it had been possible for me to avoid it; I also beg, Madam, you\r\nwill be persuaded, although I feel myself exempt from reproach, I am\r\nnot exempt from sorrow; and I can with the greatest sincerity add,\r\nthose I have caused you have a great share in those I feel. To believe\r\nin those sentiments which I now presume to assure you of, it will be\r\nenough you do yourself justice, and know, that without the honour of\r\nbeing known to you, yet I have that of knowing you.\r\n\r\nStill whilst I lament the fatality which has caused at once your grief\r\nand my misfortune, I am taught to believe, that totally taken up with a\r\nthirst for revenge, you sought means to satiate it even in the severity\r\nof the laws.\r\n\r\nPermit me first to observe on this subject, that here your grief\r\ndeceives you; for my interest in this circumstance is so intimately\r\nlinked with M. de Valmont’s, that his memory would be involved in\r\nthe same sentence you would have excited against me. I should then\r\nreasonably suppose, Madam, I should rather expect assistance than\r\nobstacles from you, in the endeavours I should be obliged to make, that\r\nthis unhappy event should remain buried in oblivion.\r\n\r\nBut this resource of complicity, which is equally favourable to the\r\ninnocent and guilty, is not sufficient to satisfy my delicacy; in\r\nwishing to set you aside as a party, I call on you as my judge: the\r\nesteem of those I respect is too dear, to suffer me to lose yours\r\nwithout defending it, and I think I am furnished with the means.\r\n\r\nFor if you will only agree, that revenge is permitted, or rather, that\r\na man owes it to himself, when he is betrayed in his love, in his\r\nfriendship, and still more, in his confidence. If you agree to this,\r\nthe wrongs I have done will disappear: I do not ask you to believe what\r\nI say; but read, if you have the resolution, the deposit I put into\r\nyour hands[1]; the number of original letters seem to authenticate\r\nthose, of which there is only copies. Moreover, I received those\r\nletters, as I have the honour to transmit them to you, from M. de\r\nValmont himself. I have not added to them, nor have I taken any from\r\nthem but two letters, which I thought proper to publish.\r\n\r\nThe one was necessary to the mutual vengeance of M. de Valmont and\r\nmyself, to which we had an equal right, and of which he expressly gave\r\nme a charge. I moreover thought, it would be doing an essential service\r\nto society, to unmask a woman so really dangerous as Madame de Merteuil\r\nis, and who, as you see, is the only, the true cause, of what happened\r\nbetween M. de Valmont and me.\r\n\r\nA sentiment of justice induced me to publish the second, for the\r\njustification of M. de Prevan, whom I scarcely know; but who did not in\r\nthe least deserve the rigorous treatment he has met, nor the severity\r\nof the public opinion, still more formidable, under which he has\r\nlanguished so long, without being able to make any defence.\r\n\r\nYou will only find copies of those two letters, as I make it a point\r\nto keep the originals. I do not think I can put into safer hands\r\na deposit, which, perhaps, I think of consequence to me not to be\r\ndestroyed, but which I should be ashamed to abuse. I think, confiding\r\nthose papers to you, Madam, I serve those who are interested, as\r\nwell as if I returned them to themselves, and I preserve them from\r\nthe embarrassment of receiving them from me, and of knowing I am no\r\nstranger to events, which undoubtedly they wish all the world to be\r\nunacquainted with.\r\n\r\nI should, however, inform you, the annexed correspondence is only a\r\npart of a much more voluminous collection from which M. de Valmont drew\r\nit in my presence, and which you will find at the taking off the seals,\r\nentitled as I saw, _An open account between the Marchioness de Merteuil\r\nand Viscount de Valmont_. On this you will take what measures your\r\nprudence will suggest. I am with great respect,\r\n\r\nMadam, &c.\r\n\r\nP. S. Some advices I have received, and the opinion of some friends,\r\nhave made me resolve to leave Paris for some time; but the place of my\r\nretreat, which is secret to every one, must not be so to you. If you do\r\nme the honour of an answer, I beg you will direct it to the commandery\r\nof —— by P.—and under cover, to M. the Commander of ——. It is from\r\nhis house I have the honour to write to you.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Dec._ 12, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] It is from this correspondence, from that given at the death of\r\nM. de Tourvel, and the letters confided to M. Rosemonde, by Madame de\r\nVolanges, that the present collection has been compiled; the originals\r\nare still existing in the possession of Madame de Rosemonde’s heirs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXX.\r\n\r\nMadame de Volanges _to_ Madame de Rosemonde.\r\n\r\n\r\nI go, my dear friend, from wonder to wonder, from sorrow to sorrow: one\r\nmust be a mother to conceive my sufferings all yesterday morning—If\r\nmy cruel uneasiness has been since alleviated, there still remains a\r\npiercing affliction, of which I cannot see the end.\r\n\r\nYesterday, about ten in the morning, surprised at not seeing my\r\ndaughter, I sent my waiting maid to know what could occasion this\r\ndelay—She returned instantly much frightened, and frightened me\r\nmuch more, by telling me my daughter was not in her apartment, and\r\nthat since morning her waiting maid had not seen her. Judge you my\r\nsituation! I had all my servants called, particularly the porter, who\r\nall swore they knew nothing of her, nor gave me any intelligence on\r\nthis occasion. I went immediately into her apartment; the disorder it\r\nwas in soon convinced me, she did not go out until morning, but could\r\nnot discover any thing to clear up my doubts. I examined her drawers,\r\nher bureau; found every thing in its place, and all her clothes except\r\nthe dress she had on when she went out: she did not even take the\r\nlittle money she had.\r\n\r\nAs she did not know until yesterday all that is said about M. de\r\nMerteuil; that she is very much attached to her; so much, that she\r\ndid nothing but cry all night after—I also recollect she did not\r\nknow M. de Merteuil was in the country; it struck me she went to see\r\nher friend, and that she was so foolish as to go alone: but the time\r\nelapsing, and no account of her, recalled all my uneasiness—Every\r\ninstant increased my anxiety; and burning with impatience for\r\ninformation, I dared not take any step to be informed, lest I should\r\ngive cause for a rumour, which perhaps I should afterwards wish to hide\r\nfrom all the world. In my life I never suffered so much.\r\n\r\nAt length, at past two o’clock, I received together a letter from\r\nmy daughter, and one from the superior of the convent of ——. My\r\ndaughter’s letter only informed me, she was afraid I would oppose the\r\nvocation she had to a religious life, which she did not dare mention to\r\nme; the rest was only excusing herself for having taken this resolution\r\nwithout my leave, being assured I certainly would not disapprove it,\r\nif I knew her motives, which, however, she begged I would not enquire\r\ninto.\r\n\r\nThe superior informed me, that seeing a young person come alone, she at\r\nfirst refused to receive her; but having interrogated, and learning who\r\nshe was, she thought she served me, by giving an asylum to my daughter,\r\nnot to expose her to run about, which she certainly was determined\r\non doing. The superior offered me, as was reasonable, to give up my\r\ndaughter, if I required it; inviting me at the same time, not to oppose\r\na vocation she calls so decided.\r\n\r\nShe writes me also, she could not inform me sooner of this event, by\r\nthe difficulty she had of prevailing on my daughter to write to me\r\nwhose intent was, that no one should know where she had retired—What a\r\ncruel thing is the unreasonableness of children.\r\n\r\nI went immediately to this convent. After having seen the superior, I\r\ndesired to see my daughter; she came trembling, with some difficulty—I\r\nspoke to her before the nuns, and then alone. All I could get out\r\nof her with a deal of crying, was, she could not be happy but in a\r\nconvent; I resolved to give her leave to stay there; but not to be\r\nranked among those who desired admittance as she wanted. I fear M. de\r\nTourvel’s and M. de Valmont’s deaths have too much affected her young\r\nhead. Although I respect much a religious vocation, I shall not without\r\nsorrow, and even dread, see my daughter embrace this state—I think we\r\nhave already duties enough to fulfil, without creating ourselves new\r\nones: moreover, it is not at her age we can judge what condition is\r\nsuitable for us.\r\n\r\nWhat increases my embarrassment, is the speedy return of M. de\r\nGercourt—Must I break off this advantageous match? How then can one\r\ncontribute to their children’s happiness, if our wishes and cares are\r\nnot sufficient? You would much oblige me to let me know how you would\r\nact in my situation; I cannot fix on any thing. There is nothing so\r\ndreadful as to decide on the fate of others; and I am equally afraid,\r\non this occasion, of using the severity of a judge, or the weakness of\r\na mother.\r\n\r\nI always reproach myself with increasing your griefs, by relating mine;\r\nbut I know your heart; the consolation you could give others, would be\r\nthe greatest you could possibly receive.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear and worthy friend! I expect your two answers with the\r\ngreatest impatience.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Dec._ 13, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXI.\r\n\r\nMadame de Rosemonde _to the_ Chevalier Danceny.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe information you have given me, Sir, leaves me no room for any\r\nthing but sorrow and silence. One regrets to live, when they hear such\r\nhorrible actions; one must be ashamed of their sex, when they see a\r\nwoman capable of such abominations.\r\n\r\nI will willingly assist all in my power, Sir, as far as I am concerned,\r\nto bury in silence and forgetfulness every thing that could leave any\r\ntrace or consequence to those melancholy events. I even wish they may\r\nnever give you any other uneasiness than those inseparable from the\r\nunhappy advantage you gained over my nephew. Notwithstanding his\r\nfaults, which I am forced to confess, I feel I shall never be consoled\r\nfor his loss: but my everlasting affliction will be the only revenge\r\nI shall ever take on you; I leave it to your own heart to value its\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nWill you permit my age to make a reflection which seldom occurs to\r\nyours? which is, if rightly understood what is solid happiness, we\r\nshould never seek it beyond the bounds prescribed by religion and the\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\nYou may be very certain I will faithfully and willingly keep the\r\ndeposit you have confided to me: but I must require of you to authorise\r\nme not to deliver it to any one, not even to yourself, Sir, unless it\r\nshould be necessary for your justification. I dare believe you will\r\nnot refuse me this request, and that it is now unnecessary to make you\r\nsensible we often sigh for having given way to the most just revenge.\r\n\r\nI have not yet done with my requisitions, persuaded as I am of your\r\ngenerosity and delicacy: it would be an act worthy both, to give me\r\nup also Mademoiselle de Volanges’s letters, which you probably may\r\nhave preserved, and which, no doubt, are no longer interesting. I know\r\nthis young creature has used you badly; but I do not think you mean to\r\npunish her; and was it only out of respect to yourself, you will not\r\ndebase an object you loved so much. I have, therefore, no occasion to\r\nadd, the respect the girl is unworthy of, is well due to the mother,\r\nto that respectable woman, who may lay some claim to a reparation from\r\nyou; for, indeed, whatever colour one may seek to put on a pretended\r\nsentimental delicacy, he who first attempts to seduce a virtuous and\r\ninnocent heart, by that measure becomes the first abettor of its\r\ncorruption, and should be for ever accountable for the excesses and\r\ndisorders that are the consequence.\r\n\r\nDo not be surprised, Sir, at so much severity from me; it is the\r\nstrongest proof I can give you of my perfect esteem. You will still\r\nacquire an additional right to it, if you acquiesce, as I wish, to the\r\nconcealing a secret, the publication of which would prejudice yourself,\r\nand give a mortal stab to a maternal heart you have already wounded. In\r\na word, Sir, I wish to render this service to my friend; and if I had\r\nthe least apprehension you would refuse me this consolation, I would\r\ndesire you to think first, it is the only one you had left me.\r\n\r\n                          I have the honour to be, &c.\r\n_Castle of_ ——, _Dec._ 15, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXII.\r\n\r\nMadame de Rosemonde _to_ Madame de Volanges.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I had been obliged to send to Paris, my dear friend, and wait for\r\nan answer to the eclaircissements you require concerning Madame de\r\nMerteuil, it would not have been possible to give them to you yet; and\r\neven then they would be, doubtless, vague and uncertain: but I received\r\nsome I did not expect, that I had not the least reason to expect, and\r\nthey are indubitable. O, my dear friend! how greatly you have been\r\ndeceived in this woman!\r\n\r\nI have great reluctance to enter into the particulars of this heap of\r\nshocking abominations; but let what will be given out, be assured\r\nit will not exceed the truth. I think, my dear friend, you know me\r\nsufficiently to take my word, and that you will not require from me any\r\nproof. Let it suffice to tell you, there is a multitude of them, which\r\nI have now in my possession.\r\n\r\nIt is not without the greatest trouble I must also make you the same\r\nrequest, not to oblige me to give my motives for the advice you require\r\nconcerning Mademoiselle de Volanges. I entreat you not to oppose the\r\nvocation she shows.\r\n\r\nCertainly, no reason whatever should authorise the forcing a person\r\ninto that state, when there is no call: but it is sometimes a great\r\nhappiness when there is; and you see your daughter even tells you, if\r\nyou knew her motives you would not disapprove them. He who inspires us\r\nwith sentiments, knows better than our vain wisdom can direct, what is\r\nsuitable to every one; and what is often taken for an act of severity,\r\nis an act of his clemency.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, my advice, which I know will afflict you, for which\r\nreason you must believe I have reflected well on it, is, that you\r\nshould leave Mademoiselle de Volanges in the convent, since it is\r\nher choice; and that you should rather encourage than counteract\r\nthe project she has formed; and in expectation of its being put in\r\nexecution, not to hesitate in breaking off the intended match.\r\n\r\nNow that I have fulfilled those painful duties of friendship, and\r\nincapable as I am of adding any consolation, the only favour I have to\r\nrequest, my dear friend, is, not to put me any interrogatories on any\r\nsubject relative to those melancholy events: let us leave them in the\r\noblivion suitable to them; and without seeking useless or afflicting\r\nknowledge, submit to the decrees of Providence, confiding in the wisdom\r\nof its views whenever it does not permit us to comprehend them. Adieu,\r\nmy dear friend!\r\n\r\n_Castle of_ ——, _Dec._ 15, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXIII.\r\n\r\nMadame de Volanges _to_ Madame de Rosemonde.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlas, my dear friend! with what a frightful veil do you cover the\r\nfate of my daughter; and seem to dread I should raise it! What can\r\nit hide, then, more afflicting to a mother’s heart, than those\r\nhorrible suspicions to which you give me up? The more I consider your\r\nfriendship, your indulgence, the more my torments are increased.\r\nTwenty times since last night, I wanted to be rid of those cruel\r\nuncertainties, and to beg you would inform me, without reserve or\r\nevasion, and each time shuddered, when I recollected your request not\r\nto be interrogated. At length, I have thought on a way which still\r\ngives me some hope; and I expect from your friendship, you will not\r\nrefuse to grant my wish: which is, to inform me if I have nearly\r\nunderstood what you might have to tell me; not to be afraid to acquaint\r\nme with all a mother’s tenderness can hide, and is not impossible to be\r\nrepaired. If my miseries exceed those bounds, then I consent to leave\r\nthe explanation to your silence: here is, then, what I already know,\r\nand so far my fears extended.\r\n\r\nMy daughter showed a liking for Chevalier Danceny, and I was informed,\r\nshe went so far as to receive letters from him, and even to answer\r\nthem; but I thought I had prevented this juvenile error from having\r\nany dangerous consequence: now that I am in dread of every thing, I\r\nconceive it possible my vigilance may have been deceived, and I dread\r\nmy daughter being seduced may have completed the measure of her follies.\r\n\r\nI now recall to mind several circumstances that may strengthen this\r\napprehension. I wrote you, my daughter was taken ill, on the news of\r\nM. de Valmont’s misfortune; perhaps, the cause of this sensibility\r\nwas the idea of the dangers M. Danceny was exposed to in this combat.\r\nSince when, she wept so much on hearing every thing was said of Madame\r\nde Merteuil; perhaps, what I imagined the grief of friendship, was\r\nnothing else but the effect of jealousy, or regret at finding her lover\r\nfaithless. Her last step may, I think, perhaps be explained by the\r\nsame motive. Some, who have been disgusted with mankind, have imagined\r\nthey received a call from heaven. In short, supposing those things to\r\nbe so, and that you are acquainted with them, you may, no doubt, have\r\nthought them sufficient to justify the rigorous advice you give me.\r\n\r\nAnd if matters should be so, at the same time I should blame my\r\ndaughter, I should think myself bound to attempt every method to\r\nsave her from the torments and dangers of an illusory and transitory\r\nvocation. If M. Danceny is not totally divested of every honourable\r\nsentiment, he will not surely refuse to repair an injury of which he is\r\nthe sole author; and I also think, a marriage with my daughter, not to\r\nmention her family, would be advantageously flattering to him.\r\n\r\nThis, my dear and worthy friend, is my last hope; hasten to confirm it,\r\nif possible. You may judge how impatient I shall be for an answer, and\r\nwhat a mortal blow your silence would give me.[1]\r\n\r\nI was just closing my letter, when a man of my acquaintance came to\r\nsee me, and related to me a cruel scene Madame de Merteuil had to go\r\nthrough yesterday. As I saw no one for some days, I heard nothing of\r\nthis affair. I will recite it, as I had it from an eye witness.\r\n\r\nMadame de Merteuil, at her return from the country on Thursday, was set\r\ndown at the Italian comedy, where she had a box; there she was alone;\r\nand what must appear to her very extraordinary, not a man came near her\r\nduring the whole performance. At coming away, she went, according to\r\ncustom, into the little saloon, which was full of company; instantly a\r\nbuzzing began, of which probably she did not think herself the object.\r\nShe observed an empty place on one of the seats, on which she sat down;\r\nbut all the ladies who were seated on it immediately rose, as if in\r\nconcert, and left her entirely alone. This so pointed mark of general\r\nindignation was applauded by all the men, redoubled the murmurs, which,\r\nit is said, were even at last increased to hootings.\r\n\r\nThat nothing should be wanting to complete her humiliation,\r\nunfortunately for her, M. de Prevan, who had not appeared in public\r\nsince his adventure, made his appearance at that instant. The moment he\r\nentered, every one, men and women, surrounded and applauded him; and he\r\nwas jostled in such a manner, as to be brought directly opposite M. de\r\nMerteuil by the company who formed a circle round him. It is asserted,\r\nshe preserved the appearance of neither seeing or hearing any thing,\r\nand that she did not even change countenance; but I am apt to believe\r\nthis last an exaggeration. However, this truly ignominious situation\r\nlasted until her carriage was announced; and at her departure, those\r\nscandalous hootings and hissings were again redoubled. It is shocking\r\nto be related to this woman. M. de Prevan received a most hearty\r\nwelcome from all the officers of his corps who were there, and there is\r\nnot the least doubt but he will be restored soon to his rank.\r\n\r\nThe same person who gave me this information told me M. de Merteuil was\r\ntaken the night following with a very violent fever, that was at first\r\nimagined to be the effect of the dreadful situation she was in; but\r\nlast night the small pox declared itself, it is of the confluent kind,\r\nand of the worst sort. On my word, I think it would be the greatest\r\nhappiness if it should carry her off. It is, moreover, reported, this\r\naffair will prejudice her most essentially in her depending lawsuit,\r\nwhich is soon to be brought to trial, and in which, it is said, she\r\nstood in need of powerful protection.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear and worthy friend! In all this I see the hand of\r\nProvidence punishing the wicked: but do not find any consolation for\r\ntheir unhappy victims.\r\n\r\n_Paris, Dec._ 18, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] This letter remained unanswered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXIV.\r\n\r\n_The_ Chevalier Danceny _to_ Madame de Rosemonde.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are very right, Madam; most certainly I will not refuse you any\r\nthing that depends on me, and on which you are inclined to set a value.\r\nThe packet I have the honour to send you, contains all Mademoiselle de\r\nVolanges’ letters. If you will take the trouble to read them, you will\r\nbe astonished to see so much candour united with such perfidiousness.\r\nThis is, at least, what has made the strongest impression on my mind,\r\nat my last perusal of them.\r\n\r\nBut it is impossible to avoid being filled with the greatest\r\nindignation against M. de Merteuil, when one recollects what horrible\r\npleasure and pains she took to destroy so much innocence and candour.\r\n\r\nNo, Madam, I am no longer in love. I have not the least spark of a\r\nsentiment so unworthily betrayed; and it is not love that puts me\r\non means to justify Mademoiselle de Volanges. Still would not that\r\ninnocent heart, that soft and easy temper, be moulded to good more\r\nreadily than it was hurried to evil? What young person, just come out\r\nof a convent, without experience, and almost divested of ideas, and\r\nbringing with her into the world, as most always happens, an equal\r\nshare of ignorance of good and evil; what young person could have\r\nresisted such culpable artifices more? In order to inspire us with some\r\nindulgence, it is sufficient to reflect on how many circumstances,\r\nindependent of us, is the frightful alternative from delicacy, to the\r\ndepravity of sentiment. You, then, did me justice, Madam, in believing\r\nme incapable of having any idea of revenge, for the injuries I received\r\nfrom Mademoiselle de Volanges, and which, notwithstanding, I felt very\r\nsensibly. The sacrifice is great, in being obliged to give over loving\r\nher: but the attempt would be too great for me to hate her.\r\n\r\nI had no need of reflection to wish every thing that concerns, or that\r\ncould be prejudicial to her, should ever be kept secret from the world.\r\nIf I have appeared something dilatory in fulfilling your wishes on this\r\noccasion, I believe I may tell you my motive; I wished first to be\r\ncertain I should not be troubled on my late unhappy affair. At a time\r\nwhen I was soliciting your indulgence, when I even dared to think I had\r\nsome right to it, I should have dreaded having the least appearance in\r\na manner of purchasing it by this condescension: certain of the purity\r\nof my motives, I had, I own, the vanity to wish you could not have the\r\nleast doubt of them.\r\n\r\nI hope you will pardon this delicacy, perhaps too susceptible, to the\r\nveneration with which you have inspired me, and to the great value of\r\nyour esteem.\r\n\r\nThe same sentiment makes me request as a favour, you will be so\r\nobliging to let me know if you think I have fulfilled all the\r\nobligations the unhappy circumstances I was in required. Once satisfied\r\non this point, my resolution is taken; I set out for Malta: there I\r\nshall with pleasure take and religiously keep vows which will separate\r\nme from a world, with which, though young, I have so much reason to be\r\ndissatisfied—I will endeavour in a foreign clime, to lose the idea of\r\nso many accumulated horrors, whose remembrance can only bring sorrow\r\nto my head.\r\n\r\n                         I am with the greatest respect, Madam, &c.\r\n_Paris, Dec._ 26, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER CLXXV.\r\n\r\nMadame de Volanges _to_ Madame de Rosemonde.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt length, my dear and worthy friend, Madame de Merteuil’s fate is\r\ndetermined; and it is such, that her greatest enemies are divided\r\nbetween the indignation she deserves, and the compassion she raises. I\r\nwas right, when I wrote you it would be happy for her to have died of\r\nthe small pox. She is recovered, it is true, but horribly disfigured;\r\nand has lost an eye. You may well imagine, I have not seen her; but I\r\nhave been informed she is a hideous spectacle.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of —— who never loses an opportunity of saying a\r\nsarcastical thing, speaking of her yesterday, said, that her disorder\r\nhad turned her inside out; that now her mind was painted on her\r\ncountenance. Unfortunately all present thought the remark very just.\r\n\r\nAnother event adds to her disgraces and her misfortunes: her lawsuit\r\ncame to a trial the day before yesterday, and she was cast by the\r\nunanimous opinion of all the judges; costs of suit, damages, and\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nAll in favour of the minors: so that the little she had exclusive of\r\nthis suit, is all swallowed, and more too by the expences.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she was informed of this news, although still ill, she set\r\noff post in the night alone—Her people say to-day, that not one of\r\nthem would accompany her; it is imagined she has taken the road to\r\nHolland.\r\n\r\nThis sudden flight raises the general outcry more than all the rest;\r\nas she has carried off all her diamonds, which are a very considerable\r\nobject; and were a part of her husband’s succession; her plate, her\r\njewels, in short every thing she could; and has left behind her debts\r\nto the amount of 50,000 livres—it is an actual bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nThe family are to assemble to-morrow to take some measures with\r\nthe creditors. Although a very distant relation, I have offered to\r\ncontribute, but I was not at this meeting, being obliged to assist at a\r\nmore melancholy ceremony. To-morrow my daughter will put on the habit\r\nof novice; I hope you will not forget, my dear friend, my only motive\r\nin agreeing to this sacrifice, is the silence you keep with me.\r\n\r\nM. Danceny quitted Paris about a fortnight ago; it is said he is gone\r\nto Malta, to settle: perhaps it would be yet time enough to prevent\r\nhim? My dear friend, my daughter was very culpable then! You will\r\nundoubtedly excuse a mother being difficult in acquiescing to such a\r\ndreadful truth.\r\n\r\nWhat a fatality I am involved in for some time past, and has wounded me\r\nin my dearest connections! My daughter and my friend.\r\n\r\nWho can refrain being struck with horror at the misfortunes one\r\ndangerous connection may cause, and how many sorrows and troubles would\r\nbe avoided by seriously reflecting on this point! Where is the woman\r\nwho would not fly the first advances of a seducer? What mother would\r\nnot tremble to see any other but herself speak to her daughter? But\r\nthose cool reflections never occur until after the event. And one of\r\nthe most important and generally acknowledged truths, is stifled and\r\nuseless in the vortex of our absurd manners.\r\n\r\nFarewell, my dear and worthy friend! I now feel, our reason, which\r\nis inadequate to prevent misfortunes, is still less to administer\r\nconsolation[1].\r\n\r\n_Paris, Jan._ 14, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Particular reasons and considerations, which we shall always think\r\nit our duty to respect, oblige us to stop here.\r\n\r\nWe cannot at this time give the reader neither the continuation of\r\nMademoiselle de Volanges’ adventures, nor the sinister events which\r\nfulfilled the miseries or ended Madame de Merteuil’s Punishment.\r\n\r\nWe shall be permitted, perhaps, some time or other, to complete this\r\nwork, but we cannot pledge ourselves to this: even if we could, we\r\nshould first think ourselves obliged to consult the taste of the\r\npublic, who have not the same reasons we have to be concerned in this\r\npublication.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINIS.",

Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks."
