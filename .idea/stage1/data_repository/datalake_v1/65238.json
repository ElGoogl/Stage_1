They all admired\r\nMr. Cade so much, his tall lean figure, his sun-tanned face, the\r\nlight-hearted manner with which he settled disputes and cajoled\r\nthem all into good temper. This friend of his now—surely rather a\r\npeculiar-looking man. About the same height as Mr. Cade, but thickset\r\nand not nearly so good-looking. The sort of man one read about in\r\nbooks, who probably kept a saloon. Interesting, though. After all, that\r\nwas what one came abroad for—to see all these peculiar things one read\r\nabout in books. Up to now, they had been rather bored with Bulawayo.\r\nThe sun was unbearably hot, the hotel was uncomfortable, there seemed\r\nto be nowhere particular to go until the moment should arrive to motor\r\nto the Matoppos. Very fortunately, Mr. Cade had suggested picture\r\npostcards. There was an excellent supply of picture postcards.\r\n\r\nAnthony Cade and his friend had stepped a little apart.\r\n\r\n“What the hell are you doing with this pack of females?” demanded\r\nMcGrath. “Starting a harem.”\r\n\r\n“Not with this little lot,” grinned Anthony. “Have you taken a good\r\nlook at them?”\r\n\r\n“I have that. Thought maybe you were losing your eyesight.”\r\n\r\n“My eyesight’s as good as ever it was. No, this is a Castle’s Select\r\nTour. I’m Castle—the local Castle, I mean.”\r\n\r\n“What the hell made you take on a job like that?”\r\n\r\n“A regrettable necessity for cash. I can assure you it doesn’t suit my\r\ntemperament.”\r\n\r\nJimmy grinned.\r\n\r\n“Never a hog for regular work, were you?”\r\n\r\nAnthony ignored this aspersion.\r\n\r\n“However, something will turn up soon, I expect,” he remarked\r\nhopefully. “It usually does.”\r\n\r\nJimmy chuckled.\r\n\r\n“If there’s any trouble brewing, Anthony Cade is sure to be in it\r\nsooner or later, I know that,” he said. “You’ve an absolute instinct\r\nfor rows—_and_ the nine lives of a cat. When can we have a yarn\r\ntogether?”\r\n\r\nAnthony sighed.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got to take these cackling hens to see Rhodes’s grave.”\r\n\r\n“That’s the stuff,” said Jimmy approvingly. “They’ll come back bumped\r\nblack and blue with the ruts in the road, and clamouring for bed\r\nto rest the bruises on. Then you and I will have a spot or two and\r\nexchange the news.”\r\n\r\n“Right. So long, Jimmy.”\r\n\r\nAnthony rejoined his flock of sheep. Miss Taylor, the youngest and most\r\nskittish of the party, instantly attacked him.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mr. Cade, was that an old friend of yours?”\r\n\r\n“It was, Miss Taylor. One of the friends of my blameless youth.”\r\n\r\nMiss Taylor giggled.\r\n\r\n“I thought he was such an interesting-looking man.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell him you said so.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mr. Cade, how can you be so naughty! The very idea! What was that\r\nname he called you?”\r\n\r\n“Gentleman Joe?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Is your name Joe?”\r\n\r\n“I thought you knew it was Anthony, Miss Taylor.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, go on with you!” cried Miss Taylor coquettishly.\r\n\r\nAnthony had by now well mastered his duties. In addition to making the\r\nnecessary arrangements of travel, they included soothing down irritable\r\nold gentlemen when their dignity was ruffled, seeing that elderly\r\nmatrons had ample opportunities to buy picture postcards, and flirting\r\nwith everything under a catholic forty years of age. The last task\r\nwas rendered easier for him by the extreme readiness of the ladies in\r\nquestion to read a tender meaning into his most innocent remarks.\r\n\r\nMiss Taylor returned to the attack.\r\n\r\n“Why does he call you Joe, then?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, just because it isn’t my name.”\r\n\r\n“And why Gentleman Joe?”\r\n\r\n“The same kind of reason.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mr. Cade,” protested Miss Taylor, much distressed, “I’m sure you\r\nshouldn’t say that. Papa was only saying last night what gentlemanly\r\nmanners you had.”\r\n\r\n“Very kind of your father, I’m sure, Miss Taylor.”\r\n\r\n“And we are all agreed that you are quite the gentleman.”\r\n\r\n“I’m overwhelmed.”\r\n\r\n“No, really, I mean it.”\r\n\r\n“Kind hearts are more than coronets,” said Anthony vaguely, without a\r\nnotion of what he meant by the remark, and wishing fervently it was\r\nlunch time.\r\n\r\n“That’s such a beautiful poem, I always think. Do you know much poetry,\r\nMr. Cade?”\r\n\r\n“I might recite ‘The boy stood on the burning deck’ at a pinch. ‘The\r\nboy stood on the burning deck, whence all but he had fled.’ That’s all\r\nI know, but I can do that bit with action if you like. ‘The boy stood\r\non the burning deck’—whoosh—whoosh—whoosh—(the flames, you see)\r\n‘Whence all but he had fled’—for that bit I run to and fro like a dog.”\r\n\r\nMiss Taylor screamed with laughter.\r\n\r\n“Oh, do look at Mr. Cade! Isn’t he funny?”\r\n\r\n“Time for morning tea,” said Anthony briskly. “Come this way. There is\r\nan excellent café in the next street.”\r\n\r\n“I presume,” said Mrs. Caldicott, in her deep voice, “that the expense\r\nis included in the Tour?”\r\n\r\n“Morning tea, Mrs. Caldicott,” said Anthony, assuming his professional\r\nmanner, “is an extra.”\r\n\r\n“Disgraceful.”\r\n\r\n“Life is full of trials, isn’t it?” said Anthony cheerfully. Mrs.\r\nCaldicott’s eyes gleamed, and she remarked with the air of one\r\nspringing a mine:\r\n\r\n“I suspected as much, and in anticipation I poured off some tea into a\r\njug at breakfast this morning! I can heat that up on the spirit lamp.\r\nCome, father.”\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Caldicott sailed off triumphantly to the hotel, the lady’s\r\nback complacent with successful forethought.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Lord,” muttered Anthony, “what a lot of funny people it does take\r\nto make a world.”\r\n\r\nHe marshalled the rest of the party in the direction of the café. Miss\r\nTaylor kept by his side, and resumed her catechism.\r\n\r\n“Is it a long time since you saw your friend?”\r\n\r\n“Just over seven years.”\r\n\r\n“Was it in Africa you knew him?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, not this part though. The first time I ever saw Jimmy McGrath, he\r\nwas all trussed up ready for the cooking pot. Some of the tribes in the\r\ninterior are cannibals, you know. We got there just in time.”\r\n\r\n“What happened?”\r\n\r\n“Very nice little shindy. We potted some of the beggars, and the rest\r\ntook to their heels.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mr. Cade, what an adventurous life you must have led!”\r\n\r\n“Very peaceful, I assure you.”\r\n\r\nBut it was clear that the lady did not believe him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was about ten o’clock that night when Anthony Cade walked into the\r\nsmall room where Jimmy McGrath was busy manipulating various bottles.\r\n\r\n“Make it strong, James,” he implored. “I can tell you, I need it.”\r\n\r\n“I should think you did, my boy. I wouldn’t take on that job of yours\r\nfor anything.”\r\n\r\n“Show me another, and I’ll jump out of it fast enough.”\r\n\r\nMcGrath poured out his own drink, tossed it off with a practised hand\r\nand mixed a second one. Then he said slowly:\r\n\r\n“Are you in earnest about that, old son?”\r\n\r\n“About what?”\r\n\r\n“Chucking this job of yours if you could get another?”\r\n\r\n“Why? You don’t mean to say that you’ve got a job going begging? Why\r\ndon’t you grab it yourself?”\r\n\r\n“I have grabbed it—but I don’t much fancy it, that’s why I’m trying to\r\npass it on to you.”\r\n\r\nAnthony became suspicious.\r\n\r\n“What’s wrong with it? They haven’t engaged you to teach in a Sunday\r\nschool, have they?”\r\n\r\n“Do you think anyone would choose me to teach in a Sunday school?”\r\n\r\n“Not if they knew you well, certainly.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a perfectly good job—nothing wrong with it whatsoever.”\r\n\r\n“Not in South America by any lucky chance? I’ve rather got my eye on\r\nSouth America. There’s a very tidy little revolution coming off in one\r\nof those little republics soon.”\r\n\r\nMcGrath grinned.\r\n\r\n“You always were keen on revolutions—anything to be mixed up in a\r\nreally good row.”\r\n\r\n“I feel my talents might be appreciated out there. I tell you, Jimmy,\r\nI can be jolly useful in a revolution—to one side or the other. It’s\r\nbetter than making an honest living any day.”\r\n\r\n“I think I’ve heard that sentiment from you before, my son. No, the job\r\nisn’t in South America—it’s in England.”\r\n\r\n“England? Return of hero to his native land after many long years. They\r\ncan’t dun you for bills after seven years, can they, Jimmy?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think so. Well, are you on for hearing more about it?”\r\n\r\n“I’m on all right. The thing that worries me is why you’re not taking\r\nit on yourself.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you. I’m after gold, Anthony—far up in the interior.”\r\n\r\nAnthony whistled and looked at him.\r\n\r\n“You’ve always been after gold, Jimmy, ever since I knew you. It’s your\r\nweak spot—your own particular little hobby. You’ve followed up more\r\nwild-cat trails than anyone I know.”\r\n\r\n“And in the end I’ll strike it. You’ll see.”\r\n\r\n“Well, every one his own hobby. Mine’s rows, yours is gold.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you the whole story. I suppose you know all about\r\nHerzoslovakia?”\r\n\r\nAnthony looked up sharply.\r\n\r\n“Herzoslovakia?” he said, with a curious ring in his voice.\r\n\r\n“Yes. Know anything about it?”\r\n\r\nThere was quite an appreciable pause before Anthony answered. Then he\r\nsaid slowly:\r\n\r\n“Only what every one knows. It’s one of the Balkan States, isn’t it?\r\nPrincipal rivers, unknown. Principal mountains, also unknown, but\r\nfairly numerous. Capital, Ekarest. Population, chiefly brigands. Hobby,\r\nassassinating Kings and having Revolutions. Last King, Nicholas IV.\r\nAssassinated about seven years ago. Since then it’s been a Republic.\r\nAltogether a very likely spot. You might have mentioned before that\r\nHerzoslovakia came into it.”\r\n\r\n“It doesn’t except indirectly.”\r\n\r\nAnthony gazed at him more in sorrow than in anger.\r\n\r\n“You ought to do something about this, James,” he said. “Take a\r\ncorrespondence course, or something. If you’d told a story like this in\r\nthe good old Eastern days, you’d have been hung up by the heels and\r\nbastinadoed or something equally unpleasant.”\r\n\r\nJimmy pursued his course quite unmoved by these strictures.\r\n\r\n“Ever heard of Count Stylptitch?”\r\n\r\n“Now you’re talking,” said Anthony. “Many people who have never heard\r\nof Herzoslovakia would brighten at the mention of Count Stylptitch.\r\nThe Grand Old Man of the Balkans. The Greatest Statesman of Modern\r\nTimes. The biggest Villain unhung. The point of view all depends on\r\nwhich newspaper you take in. But be sure of this, Count Stylptitch will\r\nbe remembered long after you and I are dust and ashes, James. Every\r\nmove and counter move in the Near East for the last twenty years has\r\nhad Count Stylptitch at the bottom of it. He’s been a dictator and a\r\npatriot and a statesman—and nobody knows exactly what he has been,\r\nexcept that he’s been a perfect King of intrigue. Well, what about him?”\r\n\r\n“He was Prime Minister of Herzoslovakia—that’s why I mentioned it\r\nfirst.”\r\n\r\n“You’ve no sense of proportion, Jimmy. Herzoslovakia is of no\r\nimportance at all compared to Stylptitch. It just provided him with a\r\nbirthplace and a post in public affairs. But I thought he was dead?”\r\n\r\n“So he is. He died in Paris about two months ago. What I’m telling you\r\nabout happened some years ago.”\r\n\r\n“The question is,” said Anthony, “what _are_ you telling me about?”\r\n\r\nJimmy accepted the rebuke and hastened on.\r\n\r\n“It was like this. I was in Paris—just four years ago, to be exact. I\r\nwas walking along one night in rather a lonely part, when I saw half a\r\ndozen French toughs beating up a respectable-looking old gentleman. I\r\nhate a one-sided show, so I promptly butted in and proceeded to beat\r\nup the toughs. I guess they’d never been hit really hard before. They\r\nmelted like snow!”\r\n\r\n“Good for you, James,” said Anthony softly. “I’d like to have seen that\r\nscrap.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, it was nothing much,” said Jimmy modestly. “But the old boy was\r\nno end grateful. He’d had a couple, no doubt about that, but he was\r\nsober enough to get my name and address out of me, and he came along\r\nand thanked me next day. Did the thing in style too. It was then that I\r\nfound out it was Count Stylptitch I’d rescued. He’d got a house up by\r\nthe Bois.”\r\n\r\nAnthony nodded.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Stylptitch went to live in Paris after the assassination of King\r\nNicholas. They wanted him to come back and be President later, but he\r\nwasn’t taking any. He remained sound to his Monarchical principals,\r\nthough he was reported to have his finger in all the backstairs pies\r\nthat went on in the Balkans. Very deep, the late Count Stylptitch.”\r\n\r\n“Nicholas IV was the man who had a funny taste in wives, wasn’t he?”\r\nsaid Jimmy suddenly.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Anthony. “And it did for him too, poor beggar. She was some\r\nlittle guttersnipe of a music hall artiste in Paris—not even suitable\r\nfor a morganatic alliance. But Nicholas had a frightful crush on her,\r\nand she was all out for being a Queen. Sounds fantastic, but they\r\nmanaged it somehow. Called her the Countess Popoffsky, or something,\r\nand pretended she had Romanoff blood in her veins. Nicholas married her\r\nin the Cathedral at Ekarest with a couple of unwilling Arch-bishops to\r\ndo the job, and she was crowned as Queen Varaga. Nicholas squared his\r\nMinisters, and I suppose he thought that was all that mattered—but\r\nhe forgot to reckon with the populace. They’re very aristocratic and\r\nreactionary in Herzoslovakia. They like their Kings and Queens to be\r\nthe genuine article. There were mutterings and discontent, and the\r\nusual ruthless suppressions, and the final uprising which stormed the\r\nPalace, murdered the King and Queen, and proclaimed a Republic. It’s\r\nbeen a Republic ever since—but things still manage to be pretty lively\r\nthere, so I’ve heard. They’ve assassinated a President or two, just to\r\nkeep their hand in. But _revenons à nos moutons_. You had got to where\r\nCount Stylptitch was hailing you as his preserver.”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Well, that was the end of that business. I came back to\r\nAfrica and never thought of it again until about two weeks ago I\r\ngot a queer-looking parcel which had been following me all over the\r\nplace for the Lord knows how long. I’d seen in a paper that Count\r\nStylptitch had recently died in Paris. Well, this parcel contained his\r\nMemoirs—or Reminiscences, or whatever you call the things. There was\r\na note enclosed to the effect that if I delivered the manuscript at a\r\ncertain firm of publishers in London on or before October 13 they were\r\ninstructed to hand me a thousand pounds.”\r\n\r\n“A thousand pounds? Did you say a thousand pounds, Jimmy?”\r\n\r\n“I did, my son. I hope to God it’s not a hoax. Put not your trust in\r\nPrinces or Politicians, as the saying goes. Well, there it is. Owing\r\nto the way the manuscript had been following me around, I had no time\r\nto lose. It was a pity, all the same. I’d just fixed up this trip to\r\nthe interior, and I’d set my heart on going. I shan’t get such a good\r\nchance again.”\r\n\r\n“You’re incurable, Jimmy. A thousand pounds in the hand is worth a lot\r\nof mythical gold.”\r\n\r\n“And supposing it’s all a hoax? Anyway, here I am, passage booked and\r\neverything, on the way to Cape Town—and then you blow along!”\r\n\r\nAnthony got up and lit a cigarette.\r\n\r\n“I begin to perceive your drift, James. You go gold hunting as planned,\r\nand I collect the thousand pounds for you. How much do I get out of it?”\r\n\r\n“What do you say to a quarter?”\r\n\r\n“Two hundred and fifty pounds free of income tax, as the saying goes?”\r\n\r\n“That’s it.”\r\n\r\n“Done, and just to make you gnash your teeth I’ll tell you that I would\r\nhave gone for a hundred! Let me tell you, James McGrath, _you_ won’t\r\ndie in your bed counting up your bank balance.”\r\n\r\n“Anyway, it’s a deal?”\r\n\r\n“It’s a deal all right. I’m on. And confusion to Castle’s Select Tours.”\r\n\r\nThey drank the toast solemnly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nA Lady in Distress\r\n\r\n\r\n“So that’s that,” said Anthony, finishing off his glass and replacing\r\nit on the table. “What boat were you going on?”\r\n\r\n“_Granarth Castle._”\r\n\r\n“Passage booked in your name, I suppose, so I’d better travel as James\r\nMcGrath. We’ve outgrown the passport business, haven’t we?”\r\n\r\n“No odds either way. You and I are totally unlike, but we’d probably\r\nhave the same description on one of those blinking things. Height 6\r\nfeet, hair brown, eyes blue, nose, ordinary, chin ordinary——”\r\n\r\n“Not so much of this ‘ordinary’ stunt. Let me tell you that Castle’s\r\nselected me out of several applicants solely on account of my pleasing\r\nappearance and nice manners.”\r\n\r\nJimmy grinned.\r\n\r\n“I noticed your manners this morning.”\r\n\r\n“The devil you did.”\r\n\r\nAnthony rose and paced up and down the room. His brow was slightly\r\nwrinkled, and it was some minutes before he spoke.\r\n\r\n“Jimmy,” he said at last. “Stylptitch died in Paris. What’s the point\r\nof sending a manuscript from Paris to London via Africa?”\r\n\r\nJimmy shook his head helplessly.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know.”\r\n\r\n“Why not do it up in a nice little parcel and send it by post?”\r\n\r\n“Sounds a damn sight more sensible, I agree.”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” continued Anthony, “I know that Kings and Queens and\r\nGovernment officials are prevented by etiquette from doing anything\r\nin a simple, straightforward fashion. Hence King’s Messengers and all\r\nthat. In medieval days you gave a fellow a signet ring as a sort of\r\nOpen Sesame. ‘The King’s Ring! Pass, my Lord!’ And usually it was the\r\nother fellow who had stolen it. I always wonder why some bright lad\r\nnever hit on the expedient of copying the ring—making a dozen or so,\r\nand selling them at a hundred ducats apiece. They seem to have had no\r\ninitiative in the Middle Ages.”\r\n\r\nJimmy yawned.\r\n\r\n“My remarks on the Middle Ages don’t seem to amuse you. Let us get back\r\nto Count Stylptitch. From France to England via Africa seems a bit\r\nthick even for a diplomatic personage. If he merely wanted to ensure\r\nthat you should get a thousand pounds he could have left it you in his\r\nwill. Thank God neither you nor I are too proud to accept a legacy!\r\nStylptitch must have been balmy.”\r\n\r\n“You’d think so, wouldn’t you?”\r\n\r\nAnthony frowned and continued his pacing.\r\n\r\n“Have you read the thing at all?” he asked suddenly.\r\n\r\n“Read what?”\r\n\r\n“The manuscript.”\r\n\r\n“Good Lord, no. What do you think I want to read a thing of that kind\r\nfor?”\r\n\r\nAnthony smiled.\r\n\r\n“I just wondered, that’s all. You know a lot of trouble has been\r\ncaused by Memoirs. Indiscreet revelations, that sort of thing. People\r\nwho have been closed as an oyster all their lives seem positively\r\nto relish causing trouble when they themselves shall be comfortably\r\ndead. It gives them a kind of malicious glee. Jimmy, what sort of a\r\nman was Count Stylptitch? You met him and talked to him, and you’re a\r\npretty good judge of raw human nature. Could you imagine him being a\r\nvindictive old devil?”\r\n\r\nJimmy shook his head.\r\n\r\n“It’s difficult to tell. You see, that first night he was distinctly\r\ncanned, and the next day he was just a high-toned old boy with the most\r\nbeautiful manners overwhelming me with compliments till I didn’t know\r\nwhere to look.”\r\n\r\n“And he didn’t say anything interesting when he was drunk?”\r\n\r\nJimmy cast his mind back, wrinkling his brows as he did so.\r\n\r\n“He said he knew where the Koh-i-noor was,” he volunteered doubtfully.\r\n\r\n“Oh, well,” said Anthony, “we all know that. They keep it in the\r\nTower, don’t they? Behind thick plate glass and iron bars, with a lot\r\nof gentlemen in fancy dress standing round to see you don’t pinch\r\nanything.”\r\n\r\n“That’s right,” agreed Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“Did Stylptitch say anything else of the same kind? That he knew which\r\ncity the Wallace Collection was in, for instance?”\r\n\r\nJimmy shook his head.\r\n\r\n“H’m!” said Anthony.\r\n\r\nHe lit another cigarette, and once more began pacing up and down the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n“You never read the papers, I suppose, you heathen?” he threw out\r\npresently.\r\n\r\n“Not very often,” said McGrath simply. “They’re not about anything that\r\ninterests me as a rule.”\r\n\r\n“Thank Heaven I’m more civilized. There have been several mentions of\r\nHerzoslovakia lately. Hints at a Royalist restoration.”\r\n\r\n“Nicholas IV didn’t leave a son,” said Jimmy. “But I don’t suppose for\r\na minute that the Obolovitch dynasty is extinct. There are probably\r\nshoals of young ’uns knocking about, cousins and second cousins and\r\nthird cousins once removed.”\r\n\r\n“So that there wouldn’t be any difficulty in finding a King?”\r\n\r\n“Not in the least, I should say,” replied Jimmy. “You know, I\r\ndon’t wonder at their getting tired of Republican institutions. A\r\nfull-blooded, virile people like that must find it awfully tame to pot\r\nat Presidents after being used to Kings. And talking of Kings, that\r\nreminds me of something else old Stylptitch let out that night. He said\r\nhe knew the gang that was after him. They were King Victor’s people, he\r\nsaid.”\r\n\r\n“What?” Anthony wheeled round suddenly.\r\n\r\nA slow grin widened on McGrath’s face.\r\n\r\n“Just a mite excited, aren’t you, Gentleman Joe?” he drawled.\r\n\r\n“Don’t be an ass, Jimmy. You’ve just said something rather important.”\r\n\r\nHe went over to the window and stood there looking out.\r\n\r\n“Who is this King Victor, anyway?” demanded Jimmy. “Another Balkan\r\nMonarch?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Anthony slowly. “He isn’t that kind of a King.”\r\n\r\n“What is he, then?”\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, and then Anthony spoke.\r\n\r\n“He’s a crook, Jimmy. The most notorious jewel thief in the world. A\r\nfantastic, daring fellow, not to be daunted by anything. King Victor\r\nwas the nickname he was known by in Paris. Paris was the headquarters\r\nof his gang. They caught him there and put him away for seven years on\r\na minor charge. They couldn’t prove the more important things against\r\nhim. He’ll be out soon—or he may be out already.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think Count Stylptitch had anything to do with putting him\r\naway? Was that why the gang went for him? Out of revenge?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” said Anthony. “It doesn’t seem likely on the face of\r\nit. King Victor never stole the Crown jewels of Herzoslovakia as far\r\nas I’ve heard. But the whole thing seems rather suggestive, doesn’t\r\nit? The death of Stylptitch, the Memoirs, and the rumours in the\r\npapers—all vague but interesting. And there’s a further rumour to the\r\neffect that they’ve found oil in Herzoslovakia. I’ve a feeling in my\r\nbones, James, that people are getting ready to be interested in that\r\nunimportant little country.”\r\n\r\n“What sort of people?”\r\n\r\n“Financiers in City offices.”\r\n\r\n“What are you driving at with all this?”\r\n\r\n“Trying to make an easy job difficult, that’s all.”\r\n\r\n“You can’t pretend there’s going to be any difficulty in handing over a\r\nsimple manuscript at a publisher’s office?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Anthony regretfully. “I don’t suppose there’ll be anything\r\ndifficult about that. But shall I tell you, James, where I propose to\r\ngo with my £250?”\r\n\r\n“South America?”\r\n\r\n“No, my lad, Herzoslovakia. I shall stand in with the Republic, I\r\nthink. Very probably I shall end up as President.”\r\n\r\n“Why not announce yourself as the principal Obolovitch and be a King\r\nwhilst you’re about it?”\r\n\r\n“No, Jimmy. Kings are for life. Presidents only take on the job for\r\nfour years or so. It would quite amuse me to govern a kingdom like\r\nHerzoslovakia for four years.”\r\n\r\n“The average for Kings is even less, I should say,” interpolated Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“It will probably be a serious temptation to me to embezzle your share\r\nof the thousand pounds. You won’t want it, you know, when you get back\r\nweighed down with nuggets. I’ll invest it for you in Herzoslovakian oil\r\nshares. You know, James, the more I think of it, the more pleased I am\r\nwith this idea of yours. I should never have thought of Herzoslovakia\r\nif you hadn’t mentioned it. I shall spend one day in London, collecting\r\nthe booty, and then away by the Balkan express!”\r\n\r\n“You won’t get off quite as fast as that. I didn’t mention it before,\r\nbut I’ve got another little commission for you.”\r\n\r\nAnthony sank into a chair and eyed him severely.\r\n\r\n“I knew all along that you were keeping something dark. This is where\r\nthe catch comes in.”\r\n\r\n“Not a bit. It’s just something that’s got to be done to help a lady.”\r\n\r\n“Once and for all, James, I refuse to be mixed up in your beastly love\r\naffairs.”\r\n\r\n“It’s not a love affair. I’ve never seen the woman. I’ll tell you the\r\nwhole story.”\r\n\r\n“If I’ve got to listen to more of your long, rambling stories, I shall\r\nhave to have another drink.”\r\n\r\nHis host complied hospitably with this demand, then began the tale.\r\n\r\n“It was when I was up in Uganda. There was a Dago there whose life I\r\nhad saved——”\r\n\r\n“If I were you, Jimmy, I should write a short book entitled ‘Lives I\r\nhave Saved.’ This is the second I’ve heard of this evening.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, well, I didn’t really do anything this time. Just pulled the Dago\r\nout of the river. Like all Dagos, he couldn’t swim.”\r\n\r\n“Wait a minute, has this story anything to do with the other business?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing whatever, though, oddly enough, now I remember it, the man was\r\na Herzoslovakian. We always called him Dutch Pedro though.”\r\n\r\nAnthony nodded indifferently.\r\n\r\n“Any name’s good enough for a Dago,” he remarked. “Get on with the good\r\nwork, James.”\r\n\r\n“Well, the fellow was sort of grateful about it. Hung around like a\r\ndog. About six months later he died of fever. I was with him. Last\r\nthing, just as he was pegging out, he beckoned me and whispered some\r\nexcited jargon about a secret—a gold mine, I thought he said. Shoved\r\nan oilskin packet into my hand which he’d always worn next his skin.\r\nWell, I didn’t think much of it at the time. It wasn’t until a week\r\nafterwards that I opened the packet. Then I was curious, I must\r\nconfess. I shouldn’t have thought that Dutch Pedro would have had the\r\nsense to know a gold mine when he saw it—but there’s no accounting for\r\nluck——”\r\n\r\n“And at the mere thought of gold, your heart beat pitter-pat as\r\nalways,” interrupted Anthony.\r\n\r\n“I was never so disgusted in my life. Gold mine, indeed! I daresay it\r\nmay have been a gold mine to him, the dirty dog. Do you know what it\r\nwas? A woman’s letters—yes, a woman’s letters, and an Englishwoman at\r\nthat. The skunk had been blackmailing her—and he had the impudence to\r\npass on his dirty bag of tricks to me.”\r\n\r\n“I like to see your righteous heat, James, but let me point out to\r\nyou that Dagos will be Dagos. He meant well. You had saved his life,\r\nhe bequeathed to you a profitable source of raising money—your\r\nhigh-minded British ideals did not enter his horizon.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what the hell was I to do with the things? Burn ’em, that’s what\r\nI thought at first. And then it occurred to me that there would be that\r\npoor dame, not knowing they’d be destroyed, and always living in a\r\nquake and a dread lest that Dago should turn up again one day.”\r\n\r\n“You’ve more imagination than I gave you credit for, Jimmy,” observed\r\nAnthony, lighting a cigarette. “I admit that the case presented more\r\ndifficulties than were at first apparent. What about just sending them\r\nto her by post?”\r\n\r\n“Like all women, she’d put no date and no address on most of the\r\nletters. There was a kind of address on one—just one word. Chimneys.”\r\n\r\nAnthony paused in the act of blowing out his match, and he dropped it\r\nwith a quick jerk of the wrist as it burned his finger.\r\n\r\n“Chimneys?” he said. “That’s rather extraordinary.”\r\n\r\n“Why, do you know it?”\r\n\r\n“It’s one of the stately homes of England, my dear James. A place\r\nwhere Kings and Queens go for weekends, and diplomatists forgather and\r\ndiplome.”\r\n\r\n“That’s one of the reasons why I’m so glad that you’re going to England\r\ninstead of me. You know all these things,” said Jimmy simply. “A josser\r\nlike myself from the backwoods of Canada would be making all sorts of\r\nbloomers. But some one like you who’s been to Eton and Harrow——”\r\n\r\n“Only one of them,” said Anthony modestly.\r\n\r\n“Will be able to carry it through. Why didn’t I send them to her, you\r\nsay? Well, it seemed to me dangerous. From what I could make out, she\r\nseemed to have a jealous husband. Suppose he opened the letter by\r\nmistake. Where would the poor dame be then? Or she might be dead—the\r\nletters looked as though they’d been written some time. As I figured it\r\nout, the only thing was for some one to take them to England and put\r\nthem into her own hands.”\r\n\r\nAnthony threw away his cigarette, and coming across to his friend\r\nclapped him affectionately on the back.\r\n\r\n“You’re a real knight-errant, Jimmy,” he said. “And the backwoods of\r\nCanada should be proud of you. I shan’t do the job half as prettily as\r\nyou would.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll take it on then?”\r\n\r\n“Of course.”\r\n\r\nMcGrath rose, and going across to a drawer took out a bundle of letters\r\nand threw them on the table.\r\n\r\n“Here you are. You’d better have a look at them.”\r\n\r\n“Is it necessary? On the whole, I’d rather not.”\r\n\r\n“Well, from what you say about this Chimneys place, she may have been\r\nstaying there only. We’d better look through the letters and see if\r\nthere’s any clue as to where she really hangs out.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose you’re right.”\r\n\r\nThey went through the letters carefully, but without finding what they\r\nhad hoped to find. Anthony gathered them up again thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“Poor little devil,” he remarked. “She was scared stiff.”\r\n\r\nJimmy nodded.\r\n\r\n“Do you think you’ll be able to find her all right?” he asked\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\n“I won’t leave England till I have. You’re very concerned about this\r\nunknown lady, James?”\r\n\r\nJimmy ran his finger thoughtfully over the signature.\r\n\r\n“It’s a pretty name,” he said apologetically. “_Virginia Revel._”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nAnxiety in High Places\r\n\r\n\r\n“Quite so, my dear fellow, quite so,” said Lord Caterham.\r\n\r\nHe had used the same words three times already, each time in the hope\r\nthat they would end the interview and permit him to escape. He disliked\r\nvery much being forced to stand on the steps of the exclusive London\r\nclub to which he belonged and listen to the interminable eloquence of\r\nthe Hon. George Lomax.\r\n\r\nClement Edward Alistair Brent, ninth Marquis of Caterham, was a small\r\ngentleman, shabbily dressed, and entirely unlike the popular conception\r\nof a Marquis. He had faded blue eyes, a thin melancholy nose, and a\r\nvague but courteous manner.\r\n\r\nThe principal misfortune of Lord Caterham’s life was to have succeeded\r\nhis brother, the eighth Marquis, four years ago. For the previous Lord\r\nCaterham had been a man of mark, a household word all over England. At\r\none time Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, he had always bulked\r\nlargely in the counsels of the Empire, and his country seat, Chimneys,\r\nwas famous for its hospitality. Ably seconded by his wife, a daughter\r\nof the Duke of Perth, history had been made and unmade at informal\r\nweek-end parties at Chimneys, and there was hardly anyone of note in\r\nEngland—or indeed in Europe—who had not, at one time or another,\r\nstayed there.\r\n\r\nThat was all very well. The ninth Marquis of Caterham had the utmost\r\nrespect and esteem for the memory of his brother. Henry had done that\r\nkind of thing magnificently. What Lord Caterham objected to was the\r\nassumption that he was bound to follow in his brother’s footsteps,\r\nand that Chimneys was a National possession rather than a private\r\ncountry house. There was nothing that bored Lord Caterham more than\r\npolitics—unless it was politicians. Hence his impatience under the\r\ncontinued eloquence of George Lomax. A robust man, George Lomax,\r\ninclined to _embonpoint_, with a red face and protuberant eyes, and an\r\nimmense sense of his own importance.\r\n\r\n“You see the point, Caterham? We can’t—we simply can’t afford a\r\nscandal of any kind just now. The position is one of the utmost\r\ndelicacy.”\r\n\r\n“It always is,” said Lord Caterham, with a flavour of irony.\r\n\r\n“My dear fellow, I’m in a position to _know_!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, quite so, quite so,” said Lord Caterham, falling back upon his\r\nprevious line of defence.\r\n\r\n“One slip over this Herzoslovakian business and we’re done. It is most\r\nimportant that the Oil concessions should be granted to a British\r\ncompany. You must see that?”\r\n\r\n“Of course, of course.”\r\n\r\n“Prince Michael Obolovitch arrives the end of the week, and the whole\r\nthing can be carried through at Chimneys under the guise of a shooting\r\nparty.”\r\n\r\n“I was thinking of going abroad this week,” said Lord Caterham.\r\n\r\n“Nonsense, my dear Caterham, no one goes abroad in early October.”\r\n\r\n“My doctor seems to think I’m in rather a bad way,” said Lord Caterham,\r\neyeing a taxi that was crawling past with longing eyes.\r\n\r\nHe was quite unable to make a dash for liberty, however, since Lomax\r\nhad the unpleasant habit of retaining a hold upon a person with whom\r\nhe was engaged in serious conversation—doubtless the result of long\r\nexperience. In this case, he had a firm grip of the lapel of Lord\r\nCaterham’s coat.\r\n\r\n“My dear man, I put it to you imperially. In a moment of national\r\ncrisis, such as is fast approaching——”\r\n\r\nLord Caterham wriggled uneasily. He felt suddenly that he would rather\r\ngive any number of house parties than listen to George Lomax quoting\r\nfrom one of his own speeches. He knew by experience that Lomax was\r\nquite capable of going on for twenty minutes without a stop.\r\n\r\n“All right,” he said hastily, “I’ll do it. You’ll arrange the whole\r\nthing, I suppose.”\r\n\r\n“My dear fellow, there’s nothing to arrange. Chimneys, quite apart\r\nfrom its historic associations, is ideally situated. I shall be at the\r\nAbbey, less than seven miles away. It wouldn’t do, of course, for me to\r\nbe actually a member of the house party.”\r\n\r\n“Of course not,” agreed Lord Caterham, who had no idea why it would not\r\ndo, and was not interested to learn.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you wouldn’t mind having Bill Eversleigh, though. He’d be\r\nuseful to run messages.”\r\n\r\n“Delighted,” said Lord Caterham, with a shade more animation. “Bill’s\r\nquite a decent shot, and Bundle likes him.”\r\n\r\n“The shooting, of course, is not really important. It’s only the\r\npretext, as it were.”\r\n\r\nLord Caterham looked depressed again.\r\n\r\n“That will be all, then. The Prince, his suite, Bill Eversleigh, Herman\r\nIsaacstein——”\r\n\r\n“Who?”\r\n\r\n“Herman Isaacstein. The representative of the syndicate I spoke to you\r\nabout.”\r\n\r\n“The all British syndicate?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Why?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing—nothing—I only wondered, that’s all. Curious names these\r\npeople have.”\r\n\r\n“Then, of course, there ought to be one or two outsiders—just to\r\ngive the thing a _bona fide_ appearance. Lady Eileen could see to\r\nthat—young people, uncritical, and with no idea of politics.”\r\n\r\n“Bundle would attend to that all right, I’m sure.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder now.” Lomax seemed struck by an idea.\r\n\r\n“You remember the matter I was speaking about just now?”\r\n\r\n“You’ve been speaking about so many things.”\r\n\r\n“No, no, I mean this unfortunate _contretemps_”—— he lowered his\r\nvoice to a mysterious whisper—“the memoirs—Count Stylptitch’s\r\nmemoirs.”\r\n\r\n“I think you’re wrong about that,” said Lord Caterham, suppressing\r\na yawn. “People _like_ scandal. Damn it all, I read Reminiscences\r\nmyself—and enjoy ’em too.”\r\n\r\n“The point is not whether people will read them or not—they’ll read\r\nthem fast enough—but their publication at this juncture might ruin\r\neverything—everything. The people of Herzoslovakia wish to restore the\r\nMonarchy, and are prepared to offer the Crown to Prince Michael who has\r\nthe support and encouragement of His Majesty’s Government——”\r\n\r\n“And who is prepared to grant concessions to Mr. Ikey Hermanstein & Co.\r\nin return for the loan of a million or so to set him on the throne——”\r\n\r\n“Caterham, Caterham,” implored Lomax in an agonized whisper.\r\n“Discretion, I beg of you. Above all things, discretion.”\r\n\r\n“And the point is,” continued Lord Caterham, with some relish, though\r\nhe lowered his voice in obedience to the other’s appeal, “that some\r\nof Stylptitch’s Reminiscences may upset the apple cart. Tyranny and\r\nmisbehaviour of the Obolovitch family generally, eh? Questions asked in\r\nthe House. Why replace the present broad-minded and democratic form of\r\nGovernment by an obsolete tyranny? Policy dictated by the blood-sucking\r\nCapitalists. Down with the Government. That kind of thing—eh?”\r\n\r\nLomax nodded.\r\n\r\n“And there might be worse still,” he breathed. “Suppose—only\r\nsuppose that some reference should be made to—to that unfortunate\r\ndisappearance—you know what I mean.”\r\n\r\nLord Caterham stared at him.\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t. What disappearance?”\r\n\r\n“You must have heard of it? Why, it happened while they were at\r\nChimneys. Henry was terribly upset about it. It almost ruined his\r\ncareer.”\r\n\r\n“You interest me enormously,” said Lord Caterham. “Who or what\r\ndisappeared?”\r\n\r\nLomax leant forward and put his mouth to Lord Caterham’s ear. The\r\nlatter withdrew it hastily.\r\n\r\n“For God’s sake, don’t hiss at me.”\r\n\r\n“You heard what I said?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I did,” said Lord Caterham reluctantly. “I remember now hearing\r\nsomething about it at the time. Very curious affair. I wonder who did\r\nit. It was never recovered?”\r\n\r\n“Never. Of course we had to go about the matter with the utmost\r\ndiscretion. No hint of the loss could be allowed to leak out. But\r\nStylptitch was there at the time. He knew something. Not all, but\r\nsomething. We were at loggerheads with him once or twice over the\r\nTurkish question. Suppose that in sheer malice he has set the whole\r\nthing down for the world to read. Think of the scandal—of the\r\nfar-reaching results. Every one would say—why was it hushed up?”\r\n\r\n“Of course they would,” said Lord Caterham, with evident enjoyment.\r\n\r\nLomax, whose voice had risen to a high pitch, took a grip on himself.\r\n\r\n“I must keep calm,” he murmured. “I must keep calm. But I ask you\r\nthis, my dear fellow. If he didn’t mean mischief, why did he send the\r\nmanuscript to London in this roundabout way?”\r\n\r\n“It’s odd, certainly. You are sure of your facts?”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely. We—er—had our agents in Paris. The Memoirs were conveyed\r\naway secretly some weeks before his death.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it looks as though there’s something in it,” said Lord Caterham,\r\nwith the same relish he had displayed before.\r\n\r\n“We have found out that they were sent to a man called Jimmy, or James,\r\nMcGrath, a Canadian at present in Africa.”\r\n\r\n“Quite an Imperial affair, isn’t it?” said Lord Caterham cheerily.\r\n\r\n“James McGrath is due to arrive by the _Granarth Castle_\r\nto-morrow—Thursday.”\r\n\r\n“What are you going to do about it?”\r\n\r\n“We shall, of course, approach him at once, point out the possibly\r\nserious consequences, and beg him to defer publication of the\r\nMemoirs for at least a month, and in any case to permit them to be\r\njudiciously—er—edited.”\r\n\r\n“Supposing that he says ‘No, sir,’ or ‘I’ll goddarned well see you in\r\nhell first,’ or something bright and breezy like that?” suggested Lord\r\nCaterham.\r\n\r\n“That’s just what I’m afraid of,” said Lomax simply. “That’s why it\r\nsuddenly occurred to me that it might be a good thing to ask him down\r\nto Chimneys as well. He’d be flattered, naturally, at being asked to\r\nmeet Prince Michael, and it might be easier to handle him.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not going to do it,” said Lord Caterham hastily. “I don’t get on\r\nwith Canadians, never did—especially those that have lived much in\r\nAfrica!”\r\n\r\n“You’d probably find him a splendid fellow—a rough diamond, you know.”\r\n\r\n“No, Lomax. I put my foot down there absolutely. Somebody else has got\r\nto tackle him.”\r\n\r\n“It has occurred to me,” said Lomax, “that a woman might be very useful\r\nhere. Told enough and not too much, you understand. A woman could\r\nhandle the whole thing delicately and with tact—put the position\r\nbefore him, as it were, without getting his back up. Not that I approve\r\nof women in politics—St. Stephen’s is ruined, absolutely ruined,\r\nnowadays. But woman in her own sphere can do wonders. Look at Henry’s\r\nwife and what she did for him. Marcia was magnificent, unique, a\r\nperfect political hostess.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t want me to ask Marcia down for this party, do you?” asked\r\nLord Caterham faintly, turning a little pale at the mention of his\r\nredoubtable sister-in-law.\r\n\r\n“No, no, you misunderstand me. I was speaking of the influence of women\r\nin general. No, I suggest a young woman, a woman of charm, beauty,\r\nintelligence?”\r\n\r\n“Not Bundle? Bundle would be no use at all. She’s a red-hot socialist\r\nif she’s anything at all, and she’d simply scream with laughter at the\r\nsuggestion.”\r\n\r\n“I was not thinking of Lady Eileen. Your daughter, Caterham, is\r\ncharming, simply charming, but quite a child. We need some one with\r\n_savoir faire_, poise, knowledge of the world—— Ah, of course, the\r\nvery person. My cousin Virginia.”\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Revel?” Lord Caterham brightened up. He began to feel that he\r\nmight possibly enjoy the party after all. “A very good suggestion of\r\nyours, Lomax. The most charming woman in London.”\r\n\r\n“She is well up in Herzoslovakian affairs too. Her husband was at the\r\nEmbassy there, you remember. And, as you say, a woman of great personal\r\ncharm.”\r\n\r\n“A delightful creature,” murmured Lord Caterham.\r\n\r\n“That is settled, then.”\r\n\r\nMr. Lomax relaxed his hold on Lord Caterham’s lapel, and the latter was\r\nquick to avail himself of the chance.\r\n\r\n“Bye-bye, Lomax, you’ll make all the arrangements, won’t you.”\r\n\r\nHe dived into a taxi. As far as it is possible for one upright\r\nChristian gentleman to dislike another upright Christian gentleman,\r\nLord Caterham disliked the Hon. George Lomax. He disliked his puffy red\r\nface, his heavy breathing, and his prominent blue eyes. He thought of\r\nthe coming week and sighed. A nuisance, an abominable nuisance. Then he\r\nthought of Virginia Revel and cheered up a little.\r\n\r\n“A delightful creature,” he murmured to himself. “A most delightful\r\ncreature.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nIntroducing a Very Charming Lady\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Lomax returned straightway to Whitehall. As he entered the\r\nsumptuous apartment in which he transacted affairs of State, there was\r\na scuffling sound.\r\n\r\nMr. Bill Eversleigh was assiduously filing letters, but a large\r\narm-chair near the window was still warm from contact with a human form.\r\n\r\nA very likeable young man, Bill Eversleigh. Age at a guess,\r\ntwenty-five, big and rather ungainly in his movements, a pleasurably\r\nugly face, a splendid set of white teeth and a pair of honest brown\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n“Richardson sent up that report yet?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir. Shall I get on to him about it?”\r\n\r\n“It doesn’t matter. Any telephone messages?”\r\n\r\n“Miss Oscar is dealing with most of them. Mr. Isaacstein wants to know\r\nif you can dine with him at the Savoy to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“Tell Miss Oscar to look in my engagement-book. If I’m not engaged, she\r\ncan ring up and accept.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“By the way, Eversleigh, you might ring up a number for me now. Look it\r\nup in the book. Mrs. Revel, 487, Pont Street.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\nBill seized the telephone-book, ran an unseeing eye down a column of\r\nM’s, shut the book with a bang and moved to the instrument on the desk.\r\nWith his hand upon it, he paused, as though in sudden recollection.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I say, sir, I’ve just remembered. Her line’s out of order. Mrs.\r\nRevel’s, I mean. I was trying to ring her up just now.”\r\n\r\nGeorge Lomax frowned.\r\n\r\n“Annoying,” he said, “distinctly annoying.” He tapped the table\r\nundecidedly.\r\n\r\n“If it’s anything important, sir, perhaps I might go round there now in\r\na taxi. She’s sure to be in at this time in the morning.”\r\n\r\nGeorge Lomax hesitated, pondering the matter. Bill waited expectantly,\r\npoised for instant flight, should the reply be favourable.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps that would be the best plan,” said Lomax at last. “Very well,\r\nthen, take a taxi there, and ask Mrs. Revel if she will be at home this\r\nafternoon at four o’clock as I am very anxious to see her about an\r\nimportant matter.”\r\n\r\n“Right, sir.”\r\n\r\nBill seized his hat and departed.\r\n\r\nTen minutes later, a taxi deposited him at 487, Pont Street. He rang\r\nthe bell and executed a loud rat-tat on the knocker. The door was\r\nopened by a grave functionary to whom Bill nodded with the ease of long\r\nacquaintance.\r\n\r\n“Morning, Chilvers, Mrs. Revel in?”\r\n\r\n“I believe, sir, that she is just going out.”\r\n\r\n“Is that you, Bill?” called a voice over the banisters. “I thought I\r\nrecognized that muscular knock. Come up and talk to me.”\r\n\r\nBill looked up at the face that was laughing down on him, and which\r\nwas always inclined to reduce him—and not him alone—to a state of\r\nbabbling incoherency. He took the stairs two at a time and clasped\r\nVirginia Revel’s out-stretched hands tightly in his.\r\n\r\n“Hullo, Virginia!”\r\n\r\n“Hullo, Bill!”\r\n\r\nCharm is a very peculiar thing; hundreds of young women, some of them\r\nmore beautiful than Virginia Revel, might have said “Hullo, Bill,”\r\nwith exactly the same intonation, and yet have produced no effect\r\nwhatever. But those two simple words, uttered by Virginia, had the\r\nmost intoxicating effect upon Bill.\r\n\r\nVirginia Revel was just twenty-seven. She was tall and of an exquisite\r\nslimness—indeed, a poem might have been written to her slimness, it\r\nwas so exquisitely proportioned. Her hair was of real bronze, with the\r\ngreenish tint in its gold; she had a determined little chin, a lovely\r\nnose, slanting blue eyes that showed a gleam of deepest cornflower\r\nbetween the half-closed lids, and a delicious and quite indescribable\r\nmouth that tilted ever so slightly at one corner in what is known as\r\n“the signature of Venus.” It was a wonderfully expressive face, and\r\nthere was a sort of radiant vitality about her that always challenged\r\nattention. It would have been quite impossible ever to ignore Virginia\r\nRevel.\r\n\r\nShe drew Bill into the small drawing-room which was all pale and mauve\r\nand green and yellow, like crocuses surprised in a meadow.\r\n\r\n“Bill, darling,” said Virginia, “isn’t the Foreign Office missing you?\r\nI thought they couldn’t get on without you.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve brought a message for you from Codders.”\r\n\r\nThus irreverently did Bill allude to his chief.\r\n\r\n“And by the way, Virginia, in case he asks, remember that your\r\ntelephone was out of order this morning.”\r\n\r\n“But it hasn’t been.”\r\n\r\n“I know that. But I said it was.”\r\n\r\n“Why? Enlighten me as to this Foreign Office touch.”\r\n\r\nBill threw her a reproachful glance.\r\n\r\n“So that I could get here and see you, of course.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, darling Bill, how dense of me! And how perfectly sweet of you!”\r\n\r\n“Chilvers said you were going out.”\r\n\r\n“So I was—to Sloane Street. There’s a place there where they’ve got a\r\nperfectly wonderful new hip band.”\r\n\r\n“A hip band?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Bill, H.I.P. hip, B.A.N.D. band. A band to confine the hips. You\r\nwear it next the skin.”\r\n\r\n“I blush for you, Virginia. You shouldn’t describe your underwear to a\r\nyoung man to whom you are not related. It isn’t delicate.”\r\n\r\n“But, Bill dear, there’s nothing indelicate about hips. We’ve all got\r\nhips—although we poor women are trying awfully hard to pretend we\r\nhaven’t. This hip band is made of red rubber and comes just to above\r\nthe knee, and it’s simply impossible to walk in it.”\r\n\r\n“How awful!” said Bill. “Why do you do it?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, because it gives one such a noble feeling to suffer for one’s\r\nsilhouette. But don’t let’s talk about my hip band. Give me George’s\r\nmessage.”\r\n\r\n“He wants to know whether you’ll be in at four o’clock this afternoon.”\r\n\r\n“I shan’t. I shall be at Ranelagh. Why this sort of formal call? Is he\r\ngoing to propose to me, do you think?”\r\n\r\n“I shouldn’t wonder.”\r\n\r\n“Because, if so, you can tell him that I much prefer men who propose on\r\nimpulse.”\r\n\r\n“Like me?”\r\n\r\n“It’s not an impulse with you, Bill. It’s habit.”\r\n\r\n“Virginia, won’t you ever——”\r\n\r\n“No, no, no, Bill. I won’t have it in the morning before lunch. Do try\r\nand think of me as a nice motherly person approaching middle age who\r\nhas your interests thoroughly at heart.”\r\n\r\n“Virginia, I do love you so.”\r\n\r\n“I know, Bill, I know. And I simply love being loved. Isn’t it wicked\r\nand dreadful of me? I should like every nice man in the world to be in\r\nlove with me.”\r\n\r\n“Most of them are, I expect,” said Bill gloomily.\r\n\r\n“But I hope George isn’t in love with me. I don’t think he can be. He’s\r\nso wedded to his career. What else did he say?”\r\n\r\n“Just that it was very important.”\r\n\r\n“Bill, I’m getting intrigued. The things that George thinks important\r\nare so awfully limited. I think I must chuck Ranelagh. After all, I\r\ncan go to Ranelagh any day. Tell George that I shall be awaiting him\r\nmeekly at four o’clock.”\r\n\r\nBill looked at his wrist watch.\r\n\r\n“It seems hardly worth while to go back before lunch. Come out and chew\r\nsomething, Virginia.”\r\n\r\n“I’m going out to lunch somewhere or other.”\r\n\r\n“That doesn’t matter. Make a day of it, and chuck everything all round.”\r\n\r\n“It would be rather nice,” said Virginia, smiling at him.\r\n\r\n“Virginia, you’re a darling. Tell me, you do like me rather, don’t you?\r\nBetter than other people.”\r\n\r\n“Bill, I adore you. If I had to marry some one—simply had to—I mean\r\nif it was in a book and a wicked mandarin said to me ‘Marry some one or\r\ndie by slow torture,’ I should choose you at once—I should indeed. I\r\nshould say, ‘Give me little Bill.’”\r\n\r\n“Well, then——”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but I haven’t got to marry any one. I love being a wicked widow.”\r\n\r\n“You could do all the same things still. Go about, and all that. You’d\r\nhardly notice me about the house.”\r\n\r\n“Bill, you don’t understand. I’m the kind of person who marries\r\nenthusiastically if they marry at all.”\r\n\r\nBill gave a hollow groan.\r\n\r\n“I shall shoot myself one of these days, I expect,” he murmured\r\ngloomily.\r\n\r\n“No, you won’t, Bill darling. You’ll take a pretty girl out to\r\nsupper—like you did the night before last.”\r\n\r\nMr. Eversleigh was momentarily confused.\r\n\r\n“If you mean Dorothy Kirkpatrick, the girl who’s in _Hooks and Eyes_,\r\nI—well, dash it all, she’s a thoroughly nice girl, straight as they\r\nmake ’em. There was no harm in it.”\r\n\r\n“Bill, darling, of course there wasn’t. I love you to enjoy yourself.\r\nBut don’t pretend to be dying of a broken heart, that’s all.”\r\n\r\nMr. Eversleigh recovered his dignity.\r\n\r\n“You don’t understand at all, Virginia,” he said severely. “Men——”\r\n\r\n“Are polygamous! I know they are. Sometimes I have a shrewd suspicion\r\nthat I am polyandrous. If you really love me, Bill, take me out to\r\nlunch quickly.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nFirst Night in London\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is often a flaw in the best-laid plans. George Lomax had made one\r\nmistake—there was a weak spot in his preparations. The weak spot was\r\nBill.\r\n\r\nBill Eversleigh was an extremely nice lad. He was a good cricketer and\r\na scratch golfer, he had pleasant manners, and an amiable disposition,\r\nbut his position in the Foreign Office had been gained, not by brains,\r\nbut by good connections. For the work he had to do he was quite\r\nsuitable. He was more or less George’s dog. He did no responsible\r\nor brainy work. His part was to be constantly at George’s elbow, to\r\ninterview unimportant people whom George didn’t want to see, to run\r\nerrands, and generally to make himself useful. All this Bill carried\r\nout faithfully enough. When George was absent, Bill stretched himself\r\nout in the biggest chair and read the sporting news, and in so doing he\r\nwas merely carrying out a time-honoured tradition.\r\n\r\nBeing accustomed to send Bill on errands, George had dispatched him to\r\nthe Union Castle offices to find out when the _Granarth Castle_ was due\r\nin. Now, in common with most well-educated young Englishmen, Bill had\r\na pleasant, but quite inaudible voice. Any elocution master would have\r\nfound fault with his pronunciation of the word Granarth. It might have\r\nbeen anything. The Clerk took it to be Carnfrae. The _Carnfrae Castle_\r\nwas due in on the following Thursday. He said so. Bill thanked him and\r\nwent out. George Lomax accepted the information and laid his plans\r\naccordingly. He knew nothing about Union Castle liners, and took it\r\nfor granted that James McGrath would duly arrive on Thursday.\r\n\r\nTherefore, at the moment he was buttonholing Lord Caterham on the steps\r\nof the club on Wednesday morning, he would have been greatly surprised\r\nto learn that the _Granarth Castle_ had docked at Southampton the\r\npreceding afternoon.\r\n\r\nAt two o’clock that afternoon Anthony Cade, travelling under the name\r\nof Jimmy McGrath, stepped out of the boat train at Waterloo, hailed a\r\ntaxi, and after a moment’s hesitation ordered the driver to proceed to\r\nthe Blitz Hotel.\r\n\r\n“One might as well be comfortable,” said Anthony to himself, as he\r\nlooked with some interest out of the taxi windows.\r\n\r\nIt was exactly fourteen years since he had been in London.\r\n\r\nHe arrived at the hotel, booked a room, and then went for a short\r\nstroll along the Embankment. It was rather pleasant to be back in\r\nLondon again. Everything was changed of course. There had been a\r\nlittle restaurant there—just past Blackfriars Bridge—where he had\r\ndined fairly often, in company with other earnest lads. He had been a\r\nSocialist then, and worn a flowing red tie. Young—very young.\r\n\r\nHe retraced his steps back to the Blitz. Just as he was crossing the\r\nroad, a man jostled against him, nearly making him lose his balance.\r\nThey both recovered themselves, and the man muttered an apology, his\r\neyes scanning Anthony’s face narrowly. He was a short, thickset man of\r\nthe working classes, with something foreign in his appearance.\r\n\r\nAnthony went on into the hotel, wondering, as he did so, what had\r\ninspired that searching glance. Nothing in it probably. The deep tan of\r\nhis face was somewhat unusual looking amongst these pallid Londoners\r\nand it had attracted the fellow’s attention. He went up to his room\r\nand, led by a sudden impulse, crossed to the looking-glass and stood\r\nstudying his face in it. Of the few friends of the old days—just a\r\nchosen few—was it likely that any of them would recognize him now if\r\nthey were to meet him face to face? He shook his head slowly.\r\n\r\nWhen he had left London he had been just eighteen—a fair, slightly\r\nchubby boy, with a misleading seraphic expression. Small chance that\r\nthe boy would be recognized in the lean, brown-faced man with the\r\nquizzical expression.\r\n\r\nThe telephone beside the bed rang, and Anthony crossed to the receiver.\r\n\r\n“Hullo!”\r\n\r\nThe voice of the desk clerk answered him.\r\n\r\n“Mr. James McGrath?”\r\n\r\n“Speaking.”\r\n\r\n“A gentleman has called to see you.”\r\n\r\nAnthony was rather astonished.\r\n\r\n“To see _me_?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, a foreign gentleman.”\r\n\r\n“What’s his name?”\r\n\r\nThere was a slight pause, and then the clerk said:\r\n\r\n“I will send up a page boy with his card.”\r\n\r\nAnthony replaced the receiver and waited. In a few minutes there was\r\na knock on the door and a small page appeared bearing a card upon a\r\nsalver.\r\n\r\nAnthony took it. The following was the name engraved upon it:\r\n\r\n  BARON LOLOPRETJZYL.\r\n\r\nHe now fully appreciated the desk clerk’s pause.\r\n\r\nFor a moment or two he stood studying the card, and then made up his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n“Show the gentleman up.”\r\n\r\n“Very good, sir.”\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the Baron _Lolopretjzyl_ was ushered into the room, a\r\nbig man with an immense fan-like black beard and a high, bald forehead.\r\n\r\nHe brought his heels together with a click, and bowed.\r\n\r\n“Mr. McGrath,” he said.\r\n\r\nAnthony imitated his movements as nearly as possible.\r\n\r\n“Baron,” he said. Then, drawing forward a chair. “Pray sit down. I have\r\nnot, I think, had the pleasure of meeting you before?”\r\n\r\n“That is so,” agreed the Baron, seating himself. “It is my misfortune,”\r\nhe added politely.\r\n\r\n“And mine also,” responded Anthony, on the same note.\r\n\r\n“Let us now to business come,” said the Baron. “I represent in London\r\nthe Loyalist party of Herzoslovakia.”\r\n\r\n“And represent it admirably, I am sure,” murmured Anthony.\r\n\r\nThe Baron bowed in acknowledgment of the compliment.\r\n\r\n“You are too kind,” he said stiffly. “Mr. McGrath, I will not from\r\nyou conceal anything. The moment has come for the Restoration of the\r\nMonarchy, in abeyance since the martyrdom of His Most Gracious Majesty\r\nKing Nicolas IV of blessed memory.”\r\n\r\n“Amen,” murmured Anthony. “I mean Hear, Hear.”\r\n\r\n“On the throne will be placed His Highness Prince Michael who the\r\nsupport of the British Government has.”\r\n\r\n“Splendid,” said Anthony. “It’s very kind of you to tell me all this.”\r\n\r\n“Everything arranged is—when you come here to trouble make.”\r\n\r\nThe Baron fixed him with a stern eye.\r\n\r\n“My dear Baron,” protested Anthony.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, I know what I am talking about. You have with you the\r\nMemoirs of the late Count Stylptitch.”\r\n\r\nHe fixed Anthony with an accusing eye.\r\n\r\n“And if I have? What have the Memoirs of Count Stylptitch to do with\r\nPrince Michael?”\r\n\r\n“They will cause scandals.”\r\n\r\n“Most memoirs do that,” said Anthony soothingly.\r\n\r\n“Of many secrets he the knowledge had. Should he reveal but the\r\nquarter of them, Europe into war plunged may be.”\r\n\r\n“Come, come,” said Anthony. “It can’t be as bad as all that.”\r\n\r\n“An unfavourable opinion of the Obolovitch will abroad be spread. So\r\ndemocratic is the English spirit.”\r\n\r\n“I can quite believe,” said Anthony, “that the Obolovitch may have been\r\na trifle high-handed now and again. It runs in the blood. But people in\r\nEngland expect that sort of thing from the Balkans. I don’t know why\r\nthey should, but they do.”\r\n\r\n“You do not understand,” said the Baron. “You do not understand at all.\r\nAnd my lips sealed are.” He sighed.\r\n\r\n“What exactly are you afraid of?” asked Anthony.\r\n\r\n“Until I have read the Memoirs I do not know,” explained the Baron\r\nsimply. “But there is sure to be something. These great diplomats are\r\nalways indiscreet. The apple cart upset will be, as the saying goes.”\r\n\r\n“Look here,” said Anthony kindly. “I’m sure you’re taking altogether\r\ntoo pessimistic a view of the thing. I know all about publishers—they\r\nsit on manuscripts and hatch ’em like eggs. It will be at least a year\r\nbefore the thing is published.”\r\n\r\n“Either a very deceitful or a very simple young man you are. All is\r\narranged for the Memoirs in a Sunday newspaper to come out immediately.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” Anthony was somewhat taken aback. “But you can always deny\r\neverything,” he said hopefully.\r\n\r\nThe Baron shook his head sadly.\r\n\r\n“No, no, through the hat you talk. Let us to business come. One\r\nthousand pounds you are to have, is it not so? You see, I have the good\r\ninformation got.”\r\n\r\n“I certainly congratulate the Intelligence Department of the Loyalists.”\r\n\r\n“Then I to you offer fifteen hundred.”\r\n\r\nAnthony stared at him in amazement, then shook his head ruefully.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid it can’t be done,” he said, with regret.\r\n\r\n“Good. I to you offer two thousand.”\r\n\r\n“You tempt me, Baron, you tempt me. But I still say it can’t be done.”\r\n\r\n“Your own price name, then.”\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid you don’t understand the position. I’m perfectly willing to\r\nbelieve that you are on the side of the angels, and that these Memoirs\r\nmay damage your cause. Nevertheless, I’ve undertaken the job, and I’ve\r\ngot to carry it through. See? I can’t allow myself to be bought off by\r\nthe other side. That kind of thing isn’t done.”\r\n\r\nThe Baron listened very attentively. At the end of Anthony’s speech he\r\nnodded his head several times.\r\n\r\n“I see. Your honour as an English gentleman it is?”\r\n\r\n“Well, we don’t put it that way ourselves,” said Anthony. “But I dare\r\nsay, allowing for a difference in vocabulary, that we both mean much\r\nthe same thing.”\r\n\r\nThe Baron rose to his feet.\r\n\r\n“For the English honour I much respect have,” he announced. “We must\r\nanother way try. I wish you good morning.”\r\n\r\nHe drew his heels together, clicked, bowed and marched out of the room,\r\nholding himself stiffly erect.\r\n\r\n“Now I wonder what he meant by that,” mused Anthony. “Was it a threat?\r\nNot that I’m in the least afraid of old Lollipop. Rather a good name\r\nfor him, that, by the way. I shall call him Baron Lollipop.”\r\n\r\nHe took a turn or two up and down the room, undecided on his next\r\ncourse of action. The date stipulated upon for delivering the\r\nmanuscript was a little over a week ahead. To-day was the 5th of\r\nOctober. Anthony had no intention of handing it over before the last\r\nmoment. Truth to tell, he was by now feverishly anxious to read\r\nthese Memoirs. He had meant to do so on the boat coming over, but\r\nhad been laid low with a touch of fever, and not at all in the mood\r\nfor deciphering crabbed and illegible handwriting, for none of the\r\nmanuscript was typed. He was now more than ever determined to see what\r\nall the fuss was about.\r\n\r\nThere was the other job too.\r\n\r\nOn an impulse, he picked up the telephone book and looked up the name\r\nof Revel. There were six Revels in the book: Edward Henry Revel,\r\nsurgeon, of Harley Street; James Revel & Co., saddlers; Lennox Revel\r\nof Abbotbury Mansions, Hampstead; Miss Mary Revel with an address in\r\nEaling; Hon. Mrs. Timothy Revel of 487, Pont Street; and Mrs. Willis\r\nRevel of 42, Cadogan Square. Eliminating the saddlers and Miss Mary\r\nRevel, that gave him four names to investigate—and there was no reason\r\nto suppose that the lady lived in London at all! He shut up the book\r\nwith a short shake of the head.\r\n\r\n“For the moment I’ll leave it to chance,” he said. “Something usually\r\nturns up.”\r\n\r\nThe luck of the Anthony Cades of this world is perhaps in some measure\r\ndue to their own belief in it. Anthony found what he was after not half\r\nan hour later, when he was turning over the pages of an illustrated\r\npaper. It was a representation of some tableau organized by the Duchess\r\nof Perth. Below the central figure, a woman in Eastern dress, was the\r\ninscription:\r\n\r\n“The Hon. Mrs. Timothy Revel as Cleopatra. Before her marriage, Mrs.\r\nRevel was the Hon. Virginia Cawthron, a daughter of Lord Edgbaston.”\r\n\r\nAnthony looked at the picture some time, slowly pursing up his lips, as\r\nthough to whistle. Then he tore out the whole page, folded it up and\r\nput it in his pocket. He went upstairs again, unlocked his suit-case\r\nand took out the packet of letters. He took out the folded page from\r\nhis pocket and slipped it under the string that held them together.\r\n\r\nThen, at a sudden sound behind him, he wheeled round sharply. A\r\nman was standing in the doorway, the kind of man whom Anthony had\r\nfondly imagined existed only in the chorus of a Comic Opera. A\r\nsinister-looking figure, with a squat brutal head and lips drawn back\r\nin an evil grin.\r\n\r\n“What the devil are you doing here?” asked Anthony. “And who let you\r\ncome up?”\r\n\r\n“I pass where I please,” said the stranger. His voice was guttural and\r\nforeign, though his English was idiomatic enough.\r\n\r\n“Another Dago,” thought Anthony.\r\n\r\n“Well, get out, do you hear?” he went on aloud.\r\n\r\nThe man’s eyes were fixed on the packet of letters which Anthony had\r\ncaught up.\r\n\r\n“I will get out when you have given me what I have come for.”\r\n\r\n“And what’s that, may I ask?”\r\n\r\nThe man took a step nearer.\r\n\r\n“The Memoirs of Count Stylptitch,” he hissed.\r\n\r\n“It’s impossible to take you seriously,” said Anthony. “You’re so\r\ncompletely the stage villain. I like your get up very much. Who sent\r\nyou here? Baron Lollipop?”\r\n\r\n“Baron——?” The man jerked out a string of harsh-sounding consonants.\r\n\r\n“So that’s how you pronounce it, is it? A cross between gargling and\r\nbarking like a dog. I don’t think I could say it myself—my throat’s\r\nnot made that way. I shall have to go on calling him Lollipop. So he\r\nsent you, did he?”\r\n\r\nBut he received a vehement negative. His visitor went so far as to spit\r\nupon the suggestion in a very realistic manner. Then he drew from his\r\npocket a sheet of paper which he threw upon the table.\r\n\r\n“Look,” he said. “Look and tremble, accursed Englishman.”\r\n\r\nAnthony looked with some interest, not troubling to fulfil the latter\r\npart of the command. On the paper was traced the crude design of a\r\nhuman hand in red.\r\n\r\n“It looks like a hand,” he remarked. “But, if you say so, I’m quite\r\nprepared to admit that it’s a cubist picture of Sunset at the North\r\nPole.”\r\n\r\n“It is the sign of the Comrades of the Red Hand. I am a Comrade of the\r\nRed Hand.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t say so,” said Anthony, looking at him with much interest.\r\n“Are the others all like you? I don’t know what the Eugenic Society\r\nwould have to say about it.”\r\n\r\nThe man snarled angrily.\r\n\r\n“Dog,” he said. “Worse than dog. Paid slave of an effete monarchy. Give\r\nme the Memoirs, and you shall go unscathed. Such is the clemency of the\r\nBrotherhood.”\r\n\r\n“It’s very kind of them, I’m sure,” said Anthony, “but I’m afraid\r\nthat both they and you are labouring under a misapprehension. My\r\ninstructions are to deliver the manuscript—not to your amiable\r\nSociety, but to a certain firm of publishers.”\r\n\r\n“Pah!” laughed the other. “Do you think you will ever be permitted to\r\nreach that office alive? Enough of this fool’s talk. Hand over the\r\npapers, or I shoot.”\r\n\r\nHe drew a revolver from his pocket and brandished it in the air.\r\n\r\nBut there he misjudged his Anthony Cade. He was not used to men who\r\ncould act as quickly—or quicker than they could think. Anthony did not\r\nwait to be covered by the revolver. Almost as soon as the other got it\r\nout of his pocket, Anthony had sprung forward and knocked it out of his\r\nhand. The force of the blow sent the man swinging round, so that he\r\npresented his back to his assailant.\r\n\r\nThe chance was too good to be missed. With one mighty, well-directed\r\nkick, Anthony sent the man flying through the doorway into the\r\ncorridor, where he collapsed in a heap.\r\n\r\nAnthony stepped out after him, but the doughty Comrade of the Red Hand\r\nhad had enough. He got nimbly to his feet and fled down the passage.\r\nAnthony did not pursue him, but went back into his own room.\r\n\r\n“So much for the Comrades of the Red Hand,” he remarked. “Picturesque\r\nappearance, but easily routed by direct action. How the hell did that\r\nfellow get in, I wonder? There’s one thing that stands out pretty\r\nclearly—this isn’t going to be quite such a soft job as I thought.\r\nI’ve already fallen foul of both the Loyalist and the Revolutionary\r\nparties. Soon, I suppose, the Nationalists and the Independent Liberals\r\nwill be sending up a delegation. One thing’s fixed. I start on that\r\nmanuscript to-night.”\r\n\r\nLooking at his watch, Anthony discovered that it was nearly nine\r\no’clock, and he decided to dine where he was. He did not anticipate\r\nany more surprise visits, but he felt that it was up to him to be on\r\nhis guard. He had no intention of allowing his suit-case to be rifled\r\nwhilst he was downstairs in the Grill Room. He rang the bell and asked\r\nfor the Menu, selected a couple of dishes and ordered a bottle of\r\nBordeaux. The waiter took the order and withdrew.\r\n\r\nWhilst he was waiting for the meal to arrive, he got out the package of\r\nmanuscript and put it on the table with the letters.\r\n\r\nThere was a knock at the door, and the waiter entered with a small\r\ntable and the accessories of the meal. Anthony had strolled over to the\r\nmantelpiece. Standing there with his back to the room, he was directly\r\nfacing the mirror, and idly glancing in it he noticed a curious thing.\r\n\r\nThe waiter’s eyes were glued on the parcel of manuscript. Shooting\r\nlittle glances sideways at Anthony’s immovable back, he moved softly\r\nround the table. His hands were twitching, and he kept passing his\r\ntongue over his dry lips. Anthony observed him more closely. He was a\r\ntall man, supple like all waiters, with a clean-shaven, mobile face. An\r\nItalian, Anthony thought, not a Frenchman.\r\n\r\nAt the critical moment Anthony wheeled round abruptly. The waiter\r\nstarted slightly, but pretended to be doing something with the salt\r\ncellar.\r\n\r\n“What’s your name?” asked Anthony abruptly.\r\n\r\n“Giuseppe, Monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“Italian, eh?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Monsieur.”\r\n\r\nAnthony spoke to him in that language, and the man answered fluently\r\nenough. Finally Anthony dismissed him with a nod, but all the while\r\nhe was eating the excellent meal which Giuseppe served to him, he was\r\nthinking rapidly.\r\n\r\nHad he been mistaken? Was Giuseppe’s interest in the parcel just\r\nordinary curiosity? It might be so, but remembering the feverish\r\nintensity of the man’s excitement, Anthony decided against that theory.\r\nAll the same, he was puzzled.\r\n\r\n“Dash it all,” said Anthony to himself, “every one can’t be after the\r\nblasted manuscript. Perhaps I’m fancying things.”\r\n\r\nDinner concluded and cleared away, he applied himself to the perusal of\r\nthe Memoirs. Owing to the illegibility of the late Count’s handwriting,\r\nthe business was a slow one. Anthony’s yawns succeeded one another with\r\nsuspicious rapidity. At the end of the fourth chapter, he gave it up.\r\n\r\nSo far, he had found the Memoirs insufferably dull, with no hint of\r\nscandal of any kind.\r\n\r\nHe gathered up the letters and the wrapping of the manuscript which\r\nwere lying in a heap together on the table and locked them up in the\r\nsuit-case. Then he locked the door, and as an additional precaution put\r\na chair against it. On the chair he placed the water-bottle from the\r\nbathroom.\r\n\r\nSurveying these preparations with some pride, he undressed and got into\r\nbed. He had one more shot at the Count’s Memoirs, but felt his eyelids\r\ndrooping, and stuffing the manuscript under his pillow, he switched out\r\nthe light and fell asleep almost immediately.\r\n\r\nIt must have been some four hours later that he awoke with a start.\r\nWhat had awakened him he did not know—perhaps a sound, perhaps only\r\nthe consciousness of danger which in men who have led an adventurous\r\nlife is very fully developed.\r\n\r\nFor a moment he lay quite still, trying to focus his impressions. He\r\ncould hear a very stealthy rustle, and then he became aware of a denser\r\nblackness somewhere between him and the window—on the floor by the\r\nsuit-case.\r\n\r\nWith a sudden spring, Anthony jumped out of bed, switching the light on\r\nas he did so. A figure sprang up from where it had been kneeling by the\r\nsuit-case.\r\n\r\nIt was the waiter, Giuseppe. In his right hand gleamed a long thin\r\nknife. He hurled himself straight upon Anthony, who was by now fully\r\nconscious of his own danger. He was unarmed and Giuseppe was evidently\r\nthoroughly at home with his own weapon.\r\n\r\nAnthony sprang to one side, and Giuseppe missed him with the knife.\r\nThe next minute the two men were rolling on the floor together, locked\r\nin a close embrace. The whole of Anthony’s faculties were centred on\r\nkeeping a close grip of Giuseppe’s right arm so that he would be unable\r\nto use the knife. He bent it slowly back. At the same time he felt the\r\nItalian’s other hand clutching at his windpipe, stifling him, choking.\r\nAnd still, desperately, he bent the right arm back.\r\n\r\nThere was a sharp tinkle as the knife fell on the floor. At the same\r\ntime, the Italian extricated himself with a swift twist from Anthony’s\r\ngrasp. Anthony sprang up too, but made the mistake of moving towards\r\nthe door to cut off the other’s retreat. He saw, too late, that the\r\nchair and the water-bottle were just as he had arranged them.\r\n\r\nGiuseppe had entered by the window, and it was the window he made for\r\nnow. In the instant’s respite given him by Anthony’s move toward the\r\ndoor, he had sprung out on the balcony, leaped over to the adjoining\r\nbalcony and had disappeared through the adjoining window.\r\n\r\nAnthony knew well enough that it was of no use to pursue him. His\r\nway of retreat was doubtless fully assured. Anthony would merely get\r\nhimself into trouble.\r\n\r\nHe walked over to the bed, thrusting his hand beneath the pillow and\r\ndrawing out the Memoirs. Lucky that they had been there and not in the\r\nsuit-case. He crossed over to the suit-case and looked inside, meaning\r\nto take out the letters.\r\n\r\nThen he swore softly under his breath.\r\n\r\n_The letters were gone._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nThe Gentle Art of Blackmail\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was exactly five minutes to four when Virginia Revel, rendered\r\npunctual by a healthy curiosity, returned to the house in Pont Street.\r\nShe opened the door with her latchkey, and stepped into the hall to be\r\nimmediately confronted by the impassive Chilvers.\r\n\r\n“I beg pardon, ma’am, but a—a person has called to see you——”\r\n\r\nFor the moment, Virginia did not pay attention to the subtle\r\nphraseology whereby Chilvers cloaked his meaning.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Lomax? Where is he? In the drawing-room?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, ma’am, not Mr. Lomax.” Chilvers’ tone was faintly reproachful.\r\n“A person—I was reluctant to let him in, but he said his business\r\nwas most important—connected with the late Captain, I understood\r\nhim to say. Thinking therefore that you might wish to see him, I put\r\nhim—er—in the study.”\r\n\r\nVirginia stood thinking for a minute. She had been a widow now for some\r\nyears, and the fact that she rarely spoke of her husband was taken by\r\nsome to indicate that below her careless demeanour was a still aching\r\nwound. By others it was taken to mean the exact opposite, that Virginia\r\nhad never really cared for Tim Revel, and that she found it insincere\r\nto profess a grief she did not feel.\r\n\r\n“I should have mentioned, ma’am,” continued Chilvers, “that the man\r\nappears to be some kind of foreigner.”\r\n\r\nVirginia’s interest heightened a little. Her husband had been in the\r\nDiplomatic Service, and they had been together in Herzoslovakia just\r\nbefore the sensational murder of the King and Queen. This man might\r\nprobably be a Herzoslovakian, some old servant who had fallen on evil\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n“You did quite right, Chilvers,” she said with a quick, approving nod.\r\n“Where did you say you had put him? In the study?”\r\n\r\nShe crossed the hall with her light buoyant step, and opened the door\r\nof the small room that flanked the dining-room.\r\n\r\nThe visitor was sitting in a chair by the fireplace. He rose on her\r\nentrance and stood looking at her. Virginia had an excellent memory for\r\nfaces, and she was at once quite sure that she had never seen the man\r\nbefore. He was tall and dark, supple in figure, and quite unmistakably\r\na foreigner; but she did not think he was of Slavonic origin. She put\r\nhim down as Italian or possibly Spanish.\r\n\r\n“You wished to see me?” she asked. “I am Mrs. Revel.”\r\n\r\nThe man did not answer for a minute or two. He was looking her slowly\r\nover, as though appraising her narrowly. There was a veiled insolence\r\nin his manner which she was quick to feel.\r\n\r\n“Will you please state your business?” she said, with a touch of\r\nimpatience.\r\n\r\n“You are Mrs. Revel? Mrs. Timothy Revel?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I told you so just now.”\r\n\r\n“Quite so. It is a good thing that you consented to see me, Mrs. Revel.\r\nOtherwise, as I told your butler, I should have been compelled to do\r\nbusiness with your husband.”\r\n\r\nVirginia looked at him in astonishment, but some impulse quelled the\r\nretort that sprang to her lips. She contented herself by remarking\r\ndryly:\r\n\r\n“You might have found some difficulty in doing that.”\r\n\r\n“I think not. I am very persistent. But I will come to the point.\r\nPerhaps you recognize this?”\r\n\r\nHe flourished something in his hand. Virginia looked at it without much\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n“Can you tell me what it is, madame?”\r\n\r\n“It appears to be a letter,” replied Virginia, who was by now convinced\r\nthat she had to do with a man who was mentally unhinged.\r\n\r\n“And perhaps you note to whom it is addressed,” said the man\r\nsignificantly, holding it out to her.\r\n\r\n“I can read,” Virginia informed him pleasantly. “It is addressed to a\r\nCaptain O’Neill at Rue de Quenelles No. 15, Paris.”\r\n\r\nThe man seemed searching her face hungrily for something he did not\r\nfind.\r\n\r\n“Will you read it, please?”\r\n\r\nVirginia took the envelope from him, drew out the enclosure and glanced\r\nat it; but almost immediately she stiffened and held it out to him\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n“This is a private letter—certainly not meant for my eyes.”\r\n\r\nThe man laughed sardonically.\r\n\r\n“I congratulate you, Mrs. Revel, on your admirable acting. You play\r\nyour part to perfection. Nevertheless, I think that you will hardly be\r\nable to deny the signature!”\r\n\r\n“The signature?”\r\n\r\nVirginia turned the letter over—and was struck dumb with astonishment.\r\nThe signature, written in a delicate slanting hand, was Virginia Revel.\r\nChecking the exclamation of astonishment that rose to her lips, she\r\nturned again to the beginning of the letter and deliberately read the\r\nwhole thing through. Then she stood a minute lost in thought. The\r\nnature of the letter made it clear enough what was in prospect.\r\n\r\n“Well, madame?” said the man. “That is your name, is it not?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” said Virginia. “It’s my name.” “But not my handwriting,” she\r\nmight have added.\r\n\r\nInstead she turned a dazzling smile upon her visitor.\r\n\r\n“Supposing,” she said sweetly, “we sit down and talk it over?”\r\n\r\nHe was puzzled. Not so had he expected her to behave. His instinct\r\ntold him that she was not afraid of him.\r\n\r\n“First of all, I should like to know how you found me out?”\r\n\r\n“That was easy.”\r\n\r\nHe took from his pocket a page torn from an illustrated paper, and\r\nhanded it to her. Anthony Cade would have recognized it.\r\n\r\nShe gave it back to him with a thoughtful little frown.\r\n\r\n“I see,” she said. “It was very easy.”\r\n\r\n“Of course you understand, Mrs. Revel, that that is not the only\r\nletter. There are others.”\r\n\r\n“Dear me,” said Virginia, “I seem to have been frightfully indiscreet.”\r\n\r\nAgain she could see that her light tone puzzled him. She was by now\r\nthoroughly enjoying herself.\r\n\r\n“At any rate,” she said, smiling sweetly at him, “it’s very kind of you\r\nto call and give them back to me.”\r\n\r\nThere was a pause as he cleared his throat.\r\n\r\n“I am a poor man, Mrs. Revel,” he said at last, with a good deal of\r\nsignificance in his manner.\r\n\r\n“As such you will doubtless find it easier to enter the Kingdom of\r\nHeaven, or so I have always heard.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot afford to let you have these letters for nothing.”\r\n\r\n“I think you are under a misapprehension. Those letters are the\r\nproperty of the person who wrote them.”\r\n\r\n“That may be the law, madame, but in this country you have a saying\r\n‘Possession is nine points of the law.’ And, in any case, are you\r\nprepared to invoke the aid of the law?”\r\n\r\n“The law is a severe one for blackmailers,” Virginia reminded him.\r\n\r\n“Come, Mrs. Revel, I am not quite a fool. I have read these\r\nletters—the letters of a woman to her lover, one and all breathing\r\ndread of discovery by her husband. Do you want me to take them to your\r\nhusband?”\r\n\r\n“You have overlooked one possibility. Those letters were written some\r\nyears ago. Supposing that since then—I have become a widow.”\r\n\r\nHe shook his head with confidence.\r\n\r\n“In that case—if you had nothing to fear—you would not be sitting\r\nhere making terms with me.”\r\n\r\nVirginia smiled.\r\n\r\n“What is your price?” she asked in a business-like manner.\r\n\r\n“For one thousand pounds I will hand the whole packet over to you. It\r\nis very little that I am asking there; but, you see, I do not like the\r\nbusiness.”\r\n\r\n“I shouldn’t dream of paying you a thousand pounds,” said Virginia with\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n“Madame, I never bargain. A thousand pounds, and I will place the\r\nletters in your hands.”\r\n\r\nVirginia reflected.\r\n\r\n“You must give me a little time to think it over. It will not be easy\r\nfor me to get such a sum together.”\r\n\r\n“A few pounds on account perhaps—say fifty—and I will call again.”\r\n\r\nVirginia looked up at the clock. It was five minutes past four, and she\r\nfancied that she had heard the bell.\r\n\r\n“Very well,” she said hurriedly. “Come back to-morrow, but later than\r\nthis. About six.”\r\n\r\nShe crossed over to a desk that stood against the wall, unlocked one of\r\nthe drawers, and took out an untidy handful of notes.\r\n\r\n“There is about forty pounds here. That will have to do for you.”\r\n\r\nHe snatched at it eagerly.\r\n\r\n“And now go at once, please,” said Virginia.\r\n\r\nHe left the room obediently enough. Through the open door, Virginia\r\ncaught a glimpse of George Lomax in the hall, just being ushered\r\nupstairs by Chilvers. As the front door closed, Virginia called to him.\r\n\r\n“Come in here, George. Chilvers, bring us tea in here, will you please?”\r\n\r\nShe flung open both windows, and George Lomax came into the room to\r\nfind her standing erect with dancing eyes and wind-blown hair.\r\n\r\n“I’ll shut them in a minute, George, but I felt the room ought to be\r\naired. Did you fall over the blackmailer in the hall?”\r\n\r\n“The what?”\r\n\r\n“Blackmailer, George. B.L.A.C.K.M.A.I.L.E.R? Blackmailer. One who\r\nblackmails.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Virginia, you can’t be serious!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, but I am, George.”\r\n\r\n“But who did he come here to blackmail?”\r\n\r\n“Me, George.”\r\n\r\n“But, my dear Virginia, what have you been doing?”\r\n\r\n“Well, just for once, as it happens, I hadn’t been doing anything. The\r\ngood gentleman mistook me for someone else.”\r\n\r\n“You rang up the police, I suppose?”\r\n\r\n“No, I didn’t. I suppose you think I ought to have done so.”\r\n\r\n“Well——” George considered weightily. “No, no, perhaps not—perhaps\r\nyou acted wisely. You might be mixed up in some unpleasant publicity in\r\nconnection with the case. You might even have had to give evidence——”\r\n\r\n“I should have liked that,” said Virginia. “I would love to be\r\nsummoned, and I should like to see if judges really do make all the\r\nrotten jokes you read about. It would be most exciting. I was at Vine\r\nStreet the other day to see about a diamond brooch I had lost, and\r\nthere was the most perfectly lovely inspector—the nicest man I ever\r\nmet.”\r\n\r\nGeorge, as was his custom, let all irrelevancies pass.\r\n\r\n“But what did you do about this scoundrel?”\r\n\r\n“Well, George, I’m afraid I let him do it.”\r\n\r\n“Do what?”\r\n\r\n“Blackmail me.”\r\n\r\nGeorge’s face of horror was so poignant that Virginia had to bite her\r\nunder lip.\r\n\r\n“You mean—do I understand you to mean—that you did not correct the\r\nmisapprehension under which he was labouring?”\r\n\r\nVirginia shook her head, shooting a sideways glance at him.\r\n\r\n“Good heavens, Virginia, you must be mad.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose it would seem that way to you.”\r\n\r\n“But why? In God’s name, why?”\r\n\r\n“Several reasons. To begin with he was doing it so\r\nbeautifully—blackmailing me, I mean—I hate to interrupt an artist\r\nwhen he’s doing his job really well. And then, you see, I’d never been\r\nblackmailed——”\r\n\r\n“I should hope not, indeed.”\r\n\r\n“And I wanted to see what it felt like.”\r\n\r\n“I am quite at a loss to comprehend you, Virginia.”\r\n\r\n“I knew you wouldn’t understand.”\r\n\r\n“You did not give him money, I hope?”\r\n\r\n“Just a trifle,” said Virginia apologetically.\r\n\r\n“How much?”\r\n\r\n“Forty pounds.”\r\n\r\n“Virginia!”\r\n\r\n“My dear George, it’s only what I pay for an evening dress. It’s just\r\nas exciting to buy a new experience as it is to buy a new dress—more\r\nso, in fact.”\r\n\r\nGeorge Lomax merely shook his head, and Chilvers appearing at that\r\nmoment with the tea urn, he was saved from having to express his\r\noutraged feelings. When tea had been brought in, and Virginia’s deft\r\nfingers were manipulating the heavy silver teapot, she spoke again on\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\n“I had another motive too, George—a brighter and better one. We women\r\nare usually supposed to be cats, but at any rate I’d done another woman\r\na good turn this afternoon. This man isn’t likely to go off looking\r\nfor another Virginia Revel. He thinks he’s found his bird all right.\r\nPoor little devil, she was in a blue funk when she wrote that letter.\r\nMr. Blackmailer would have had the easiest job of his life there.\r\nNow, though he doesn’t know it, he’s up against a tough proposition.\r\nStarting with the great advantage of having led a blameless life, I\r\nshall toy with him to his undoing—as they say in books. Guile, George,\r\nlots of guile.”\r\n\r\nGeorge still shook his head.\r\n\r\n“I don’t like it,” he persisted. “I don’t like it.”\r\n\r\n“Well, never mind, George dear. You didn’t come here to talk about\r\nblackmailers. What did you come here for, by the way? Correct answer:\r\n‘To see _you_!’ Accent on the you, and press her hand with significance\r\nunless you happen to have been eating heavily buttered muffin, in which\r\ncase it must all be done with the eyes.”\r\n\r\n“I did come to see you,” replied George seriously. “And I am glad to\r\nfind you alone.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, George, this is so sudden,” says she, swallowing a currant.\r\n\r\n“I wanted to ask a favour of you. I have always considered you,\r\nVirginia, as a woman of considerable charm.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, George!”\r\n\r\n“And also a woman of intelligence!”\r\n\r\n“Not really? How well the man knows me.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Virginia, there is a young fellow arriving in England\r\nto-morrow whom I should like you to meet.”\r\n\r\n“All right, George, but it’s your party—let that be clearly\r\nunderstood.”\r\n\r\n“You could, I feel sure, if you chose, exercise your considerable\r\ncharm.”\r\n\r\nVirginia cocked her head a little on one side.\r\n\r\n“George, dear, I don’t ‘charm’ as a profession, you know. Often I like\r\npeople—and then, well, they like me. But I don’t think I could set\r\nout in cold blood to fascinate a helpless stranger. That sort of thing\r\nisn’t done, George, it really isn’t. There are professional sirens who\r\nwould do it much better than I should.”\r\n\r\n“That is out of the question, Virginia. This young man, he is a\r\nCanadian, by the way, of the name of McGrath——”\r\n\r\n“A Canadian of Scotch descent,” says she, deducing brilliantly.\r\n\r\n“Is probably quite unused to the higher walks of English society. I\r\nshould like him to appreciate the charm and distinction of a real\r\nEnglish gentlewoman.”\r\n\r\n“Meaning me?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon?”\r\n\r\n“I said why? You don’t boom the real English gentlewoman with every\r\nstray Canadian who sets foot upon our shores. What is the deep idea,\r\nGeorge? To put it vulgarly, what do _you_ get out of it?”\r\n\r\n“I cannot see that that concerns you, Virginia.”\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t possibly go out for an evening and fascinate, unless I knew\r\nall the whys and wherefors.”\r\n\r\n“You have a most extraordinary way of putting things, Virginia. Anyone\r\nwould think——”\r\n\r\n“Wouldn’t they? Come on, George, part with a little more information.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Virginia, matters are likely to be a little strained shortly\r\nin a certain Central European nation. It is important, for reasons\r\nwhich are immaterial, that this—Mr.—er McGrath should be brought\r\nto realize that the restoring of the Monarchy in Herzoslovakia is\r\nimperative to the peace of Europe.”\r\n\r\n“The part about the peace of Europe is all bosh,” said Virginia calmly,\r\n“but I’m all for Monarchies every time, especially for a picturesque\r\npeople like the Herzoslovakians. So you’re running a King in the\r\nHerzoslovakian States, are you? Who is he?”\r\n\r\nGeorge was reluctant to answer, but did not see his way to avoid the\r\nquestion. The interview was not going at all as he had planned. He\r\nhad foreseen Virginia as a willing, docile tool, receiving his hints\r\ngratefully, and asking no awkward questions. This was far from being\r\nthe case. She seemed determined to know all about it and this George,\r\never doubtful of female discretion, was determined at all costs to\r\navoid. He had made a mistake. Virginia was not the woman for the\r\npart. She might, indeed, cause serious trouble. Her account of her\r\ninterview with the blackmailer had caused him grave apprehension. A\r\nmost undependable creature, with no idea of treating serious matters\r\nseriously.\r\n\r\n“Prince Michael Obolovitch,” he replied, as Virginia was obviously\r\nwaiting for an answer to her question. “But please let that go no\r\nfurther.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be absurd, George. There are all sort of hints in the papers\r\nalready, and articles cracking up the Obolovitch dynasty and talking\r\nabout the murdered Nicholas IV as though he were a cross between\r\na Saint and a hero instead of a stupid little man besotted by a\r\nthird-rate actress.”\r\n\r\nGeorge winced. He was more than ever convinced that he had made a\r\nmistake in enlisting Virginia’s aid. He must stave her off quickly.\r\n\r\n“You are right, my dear Virginia,” he said hastily, as he rose to his\r\nfeet to bid her farewell. “I should not have made the suggestion I did\r\nto you. But we are anxious for the Dominions to see eye to eye with us\r\non this Herzoslovakian crisis, and McGrath has, I believe, influence in\r\njournalistic circles. As an ardent Monarchist, and with your knowledge\r\nof the country, I thought it a good plan for you to meet him.”\r\n\r\n“So that’s the explanation, is it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but I dare say you wouldn’t have cared for him.”\r\n\r\nVirginia looked at him for a second and then she laughed.\r\n\r\n“George,” she said, “you’re a rotten liar.”\r\n\r\n“Virginia!”\r\n\r\n“Rotten, absolutely rotten! If I had had your training, I could\r\nhave managed a better one than that—one that had a chance of being\r\nbelieved. But I shall find out all about it, my poor George. Rest\r\nassured of that. The Mystery of Mr. McGrath. I shouldn’t wonder if I\r\ngot a hint or two at Chimneys this week-end.”\r\n\r\n“At Chimneys? You are going to Chimneys?”\r\n\r\nGeorge could not conceal his perturbation. He had hoped to reach Lord\r\nCaterham in time for the invitation to remain unissued.\r\n\r\n“Bundle rang up and asked me this morning.”\r\n\r\nGeorge made a last effort.\r\n\r\n“Rather a dull party, I believe,” he said. “Hardly in your line,\r\nVirginia.”\r\n\r\n“My poor George, why didn’t you tell me the truth and trust me? It’s\r\nstill not too late.”\r\n\r\nGeorge took her hand and dropped it again limply.\r\n\r\n“I have told you the truth,” he said coldly, and he said it without a\r\nblush.\r\n\r\n“That’s a better one,” said Virginia approvingly. “But it’s still\r\nnot good enough. Cheer up, George, I shall be at Chimneys all right,\r\nexerting my considerable charm—as you put it. Life has become suddenly\r\nvery much more amusing. First a blackmailer, and then George in\r\ndiplomatic difficulties. Will he tell all to the beautiful woman who\r\nasks for his confidence so pathetically? No, he will reveal nothing\r\nuntil the last chapter. Good-bye, George. One last fond look before you\r\ngo? No? Oh, George, dear, don’t be sulky about it!”\r\n\r\nVirginia ran to the telephone as soon as George had departed with a\r\nheavy gait through the front door.\r\n\r\nShe obtained the number she required and asked to speak to Lady Eileen\r\nBrent.\r\n\r\n“Is that you, Bundle? I’m coming to Chimneys all right to-morrow. What?\r\nBore me? No, it won’t. Bundle, wild horses wouldn’t keep me away! So\r\nthere!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\nMr. McGrath Refuses an Invitation\r\n\r\n\r\nThe letters were gone!\r\n\r\nHaving once made up his mind to the fact of their disappearance, there\r\nwas nothing to do but accept it. Anthony realized very well that he\r\ncould not pursue Giuseppe through the corridors of the Blitz Hotel. To\r\ndo so was to court undesired publicity, and in all probability to fail\r\nin his object all the same.\r\n\r\nHe came to the conclusion that Giuseppe had mistaken the packet of\r\nletters, enclosed as they were in the other wrappings, for the Memoirs\r\nthemselves. It was likely therefore that when he discovered his mistake\r\nhe would make another attempt to get hold of the Memoirs. For this\r\nattempt Anthony intended to be fully prepared.\r\n\r\nAnother plan that occurred to him was to advertize discreetly for the\r\nreturn of the package of letters. Supposing Giuseppe to be an emissary\r\nof the Comrades of the Red Hand, or, which seemed to Anthony more\r\nprobable, to be employed by the Loyalist party, the letters could have\r\nno possible interest for either employer and he would probably jump at\r\nthe chance of obtaining a small sum of money for their return.\r\n\r\nHaving thought out all this, Anthony returned to bed and slept\r\npeacefully until morning. He did not fancy that Giuseppe would be\r\nanxious for a second encounter that night.\r\n\r\nAnthony got up with his plan of campaign fully thought out. He had\r\na good breakfast, glanced at the papers which were full of the new\r\ndiscoveries of oil in Herzoslovakia, and then demanded an interview\r\nwith the manager, and, being Anthony Cade, with a gift for getting his\r\nown way by means of quiet determination, he obtained what he asked for.\r\n\r\nThe manager, a Frenchman with an exquisitely suave manner, received him\r\nin his private office.\r\n\r\n“You wished to see me, I understand, Mr.—er—McGrath?”\r\n\r\n“I did. I arrived at your hotel yesterday afternoon, and I had dinner\r\nserved to me in my own rooms by a waiter whose name was Giuseppe.”\r\n\r\nHe paused.\r\n\r\n“I dare say we have a waiter of that name,” agreed the manager\r\nindifferently.\r\n\r\n“I was struck by something unusual in the waiter’s manner, but thought\r\nnothing more of it at the time. Later, in the night, I was awakened by\r\nthe sound of some one moving softly about the room. I switched on the\r\nlight, and found this same Giuseppe in the act of rifling my leather\r\nsuit-case.”\r\n\r\nThe manager’s indifference had completely disappeared now.\r\n\r\n“But I have heard nothing of this,” he exclaimed. “Why was I not\r\ninformed sooner?”\r\n\r\n“The man and I had a brief struggle—he was armed with a knife by the\r\nway. In the end he succeeded in making off by way of the window.”\r\n\r\n“What did you do then, Mr. McGrath?”\r\n\r\n“I examined the contents of my suit-case.”\r\n\r\n“Had anything been taken?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing of—importance,” said Anthony slowly.\r\n\r\nThe manager leaned back with a sigh.\r\n\r\n“I am glad of that,” he remarked. “But you will allow me to say, Mr.\r\nMcGrath, that I do not quite understand your attitude in the matter.\r\nYou made no attempt to arouse the hotel? To pursue the thief?”\r\n\r\nAnthony shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“Nothing of value had been taken, as I tell you. I am aware, of\r\ncourse, that strictly speaking it is a case for the police——”\r\n\r\nHe paused, and the manager murmured without any particular enthusiasm:\r\n\r\n“For the police—of course——”\r\n\r\n“In any case, I was fairly certain that the man would manage to make\r\ngood his escape, and since nothing was taken why bother with the\r\npolice?”\r\n\r\nThe manager smiled a little.\r\n\r\n“I see that you realize, Mr. McGrath, that I am not at all anxious\r\nto have the police called in. From my point of view it is always\r\ndisastrous. If the newspapers can get hold of anything connected with\r\na big fashionable hotel such as this, they always run it for all it is\r\nworth, no matter how insignificant the real subject matter may be.”\r\n\r\n“Quite so,” agreed Anthony. “Now I told you that nothing of value had\r\nbeen taken, and that was perfectly true in a sense. Nothing of any\r\nvalue to the thief was taken, but he got hold of something which is of\r\nconsiderable value to me.”\r\n\r\n“Ah?”\r\n\r\n“Letters, you understand.”\r\n\r\nAn expression of superhuman discretion, only to be achieved by a\r\nFrenchman, settled down upon the manager’s face.\r\n\r\n“I comprehend,” he murmured. “But perfectly. Naturally, it is not a\r\nmatter for the police.”\r\n\r\n“We are quite agreed upon that point. But you will understand that\r\nI have every intention of recovering these letters. In the part of\r\nthe world where I come from, people are used to doing things for\r\nthemselves. What I require from you therefore is the fullest possible\r\ninformation you can give me about this waiter, Giuseppe.”\r\n\r\n“I see no objection to that,” said the manager after a moment or two’s\r\npause. “I cannot give you the information offhand, of course, but if\r\nyou will return in half an hour’s time I will have everything ready to\r\nlay before you.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you very much. That will suit me admirably.”\r\n\r\nIn half an hour’s time, Anthony returned to the office again to find\r\nthat the manager had been as good as his word. Jotted down upon a piece\r\nof paper were all the relevant facts known about Giuseppe Manelli.\r\n\r\n“He came to us, you see, about three months ago. A skilled and\r\nexperienced waiter. Has given complete satisfaction. He has been in\r\nEngland about five years.”\r\n\r\nTogether the two men ran over a list of the hotels and restaurants\r\nwhere the Italian had worked. One fact struck Anthony as being possibly\r\nof significance. At two of the hotels in question there had been\r\nserious robberies during the time that Giuseppe was employed there,\r\nthough no suspicion of any kind had attached to him in either case.\r\nStill, the fact was significant.\r\n\r\nWas Giuseppe merely a clever hotel thief? Had his search of Anthony’s\r\nsuit-case been merely part of his habitual professional tactics? He\r\nmight just possibly have had the packet of letters in his hand at the\r\nmoment when Anthony switched on the light, and have shoved it into his\r\npocket mechanically so as to have his hands free. In that case, the\r\nthing was mere plain or garden robbery.\r\n\r\nAgainst that, there was to be put the man’s excitement of the evening\r\nbefore when he had caught sight of the papers lying on the table. There\r\nhad been no money or object of value there such as would excite the\r\ncupidity of an ordinary thief.\r\n\r\nNo, Anthony felt convinced that Giuseppe had been acting as a tool\r\nfor some outside agency. With the information supplied to him by the\r\nmanager, it might be possible to learn something about Giuseppe’s\r\nprivate life, and so finally track him down. He gathered up the sheet\r\nof paper and rose.\r\n\r\n“Thank you very much indeed. It’s quite unnecessary to ask, I suppose,\r\nwhether Giuseppe is still in the hotel?”\r\n\r\nThe manager smiled.\r\n\r\n“His bed was not slept in, and all his things have been left behind. He\r\nmust have rushed straight out after his attack upon you. I don’t think\r\nthere is much chance of our seeing him again.”\r\n\r\n“I imagine not. Well, thank you very much indeed. I shall be staying on\r\nhere for the present.”\r\n\r\n“I hope you will be successful in your task, but I confess that I am\r\nrather doubtful.”\r\n\r\n“I always hope for the best.”\r\n\r\nOne of Anthony’s first proceedings was to question some of the other\r\nwaiters who had been friendly with Giuseppe, but he obtained very\r\nlittle to go upon. He wrote out an advertisement on the lines he had\r\nplanned, and had it sent to five of the most widely read newspapers. He\r\nwas just about to go out and visit the restaurant at which Giuseppe had\r\nbeen previously employed when the telephone rang. Anthony took up the\r\nreceiver.\r\n\r\n“Hullo, what is it?”\r\n\r\nA toneless voice replied.\r\n\r\n“Am I speaking to Mr. McGrath?”\r\n\r\n“You are. Who are you?”\r\n\r\n“This is Messrs. Balderson and Hodgkins. Just a minute, please. I will\r\nput you through to Mr. Balderson.”\r\n\r\n“Our worthy publishers,” thought Anthony. “So they are getting worried\r\ntoo, are they? They needn’t. There’s a week to run still.”\r\n\r\nA hearty voice struck suddenly upon his ear.\r\n\r\n“Hullo! That Mr. McGrath?”\r\n\r\n“Speaking.”\r\n\r\n“I’m Mr. Balderson of Balderson and Hodgkins. What about that\r\nmanuscript, Mr. McGrath?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Anthony, “what about it?”\r\n\r\n“Everything about it. I understand, Mr. McGrath, that you have just\r\narrived in this country from South Africa. That being so, you can’t\r\npossibly understand the position. There’s going to be trouble about\r\nthat manuscript, Mr. McGrath, big trouble. Sometimes I wish we’d never\r\nsaid we’d handle it.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?”\r\n\r\n“I assure you it’s so. At present I’m anxious to get it into my\r\npossession as quickly as possible, so as to have a couple of copies\r\nmade. Then, if the original is destroyed—well, no harm will be done.”\r\n\r\n“Dear me,” said Anthony.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I expect it sounds absurd to you, Mr. McGrath. But, I assure\r\nyou, you don’t appreciate the situation. There’s a determined effort\r\nbeing made to prevent its ever reaching this office. I say to you quite\r\nfrankly and without humbug that if you attempt to bring it yourself\r\nit’s ten to one that you’ll never get here.”\r\n\r\n“I doubt that,” said Anthony. “When I want to get anywhere, I usually\r\ndo.”\r\n\r\n“You’re up against a very dangerous lot of people. I wouldn’t have\r\nbelieved it myself a month ago. I tell you, Mr. McGrath, we’ve been\r\nbribed and threatened and cajoled by one lot and another until we don’t\r\nknow whether we’re on our heads or our heels. My suggestion is that you\r\ndo not attempt to bring the manuscript here. One of our people will\r\ncall upon you at the hotel and take possession of it.”\r\n\r\n“And supposing the gang does him in?” asked Anthony.\r\n\r\n“The responsibility would then be ours—not yours. You would have\r\ndelivered it to our representative and obtained a written discharge.\r\nThe cheque for—er—a thousand pounds which we are instructed to hand\r\nto you will not be available until Wednesday next by the terms of our\r\nagreement with the executors of the late—er—author—you know whom I\r\nmean, but if you insist I will send my own cheque for that amount by\r\nthe messenger.”\r\n\r\nAnthony reflected for a minute or two. He had intended to keep the\r\nMemoirs until the last day of grace, because he was anxious to see for\r\nhimself what all the fuss was about. Nevertheless, he realized the\r\nforce of the publisher’s arguments.\r\n\r\n“All right,” he said, with a little sigh. “Have it your own way. Send\r\nyour man along. And if you don’t mind sending that cheque as well\r\nI’d rather have it now, as I may be going out of England before next\r\nWednesday.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, Mr. McGrath. Our representative will call upon you first\r\nthing to-morrow morning. It will be wiser not to send anyone direct\r\nfrom the office. Our Mr. Holmes lives in South London. He will call\r\nin on his way to us, and will give you a receipt for the package. I\r\nsuggest that to-night you should place a dummy packet in the manager’s\r\nsafe. Your enemies will get to hear of this, and it will prevent any\r\nattack being made upon your apartments to-night.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, I will do as you direct.”\r\n\r\nAnthony hung up the receiver with a thoughtful face.\r\n\r\nThen he went on with his interrupted plan of seeking news of the\r\nslippery Giuseppe. He drew a complete blank, however. Giuseppe had\r\nworked at the restaurant in question, but nobody seemed to know\r\nanything of his private life or associates.\r\n\r\n“But I’ll get you, my lad,” murmured Anthony, between his teeth. “I’ll\r\nget you yet. It’s only a matter of time.”\r\n\r\nHis second night in London was entirely peaceful.\r\n\r\nAt nine o’clock the following morning, the card of Mr. Holmes from\r\nMessrs. Balderson and Hodgkins was sent up, and Mr. Holmes followed\r\nit. A small, fair man with a quiet manner. Anthony handed over the\r\nmanuscript, and received in exchange a cheque for a thousand pounds.\r\nMr. Holmes packed up the manuscript in the small brown bag he carried,\r\nwished Anthony good morning, and departed. The whole thing seemed very\r\ntame.\r\n\r\n“But perhaps he’ll be murdered on the way there,” Anthony murmured\r\naloud, as he stared idly out of the window. “I wonder now—I very much\r\nwonder.”\r\n\r\nHe put the cheque in an envelope, enclosed a few lines of writing\r\nwith it, and sealed it up carefully. Jimmy, who had been more or less\r\nin funds at the time of his encounter with Anthony at Bulawayo, had\r\nadvanced him a substantial sum of money which was, as yet, practically\r\nuntouched.\r\n\r\n“If one’s job’s done with, the other isn’t,” said Anthony to himself.\r\n“Up to now, I’ve bungled it. But never say die. I think that, suitably\r\ndisguised, I shall go and have a look at 487, Pont Street.”\r\n\r\nHe packed his belongings, went down and paid his bill, and ordered his\r\nluggage to be put on a taxi. Suitably rewarding those who stood in his\r\npath, most of whom had done nothing whatever materially to add to his\r\ncomfort, he was on the point of being driven off, when a small boy\r\nrushed down the steps with a letter.\r\n\r\n“Just come for you, this very minute, sir.”\r\n\r\nWith a sigh, Anthony produced yet another shilling. The taxi groaned\r\nheavily and jumped forward with a hideous crashing of gears, and\r\nAnthony opened the letter.\r\n\r\nIt was rather a curious document. He had to read it four times before\r\nhe could be sure of what it was all about. Put in plain English (the\r\nletter was not in plain English, but in the peculiar involved style\r\ncommon to missives issued by Government officials) it presumed that Mr.\r\nMcGrath was arriving in England from South Africa to-day—Thursday, it\r\nreferred obliquely to the Memoirs of Count Stylptitch, and begged Mr.\r\nMcGrath to do nothing in the matter until he had had a confidential\r\nconversation with Mr. George Lomax, and certain other parties whose\r\nmagnificence was vaguely hinted at. It also contained a definite\r\ninvitation to go down to Chimneys as the guest of Lord Caterham, on the\r\nfollowing day, Friday.\r\n\r\nA mysterious and thoroughly obscure communication. Anthony enjoyed it\r\nvery much.\r\n\r\n“Dear old England,” he murmured affectionately. “Two days behind the\r\ntimes, as usual. Rather a pity. Still, I can’t go down to Chimneys\r\nunder false pretences. I wonder, though, if there’s an inn handy? Mr.\r\nAnthony Cade might stay at the inn without anyone being the wiser.”\r\n\r\nHe leaned out of the window, and gave new directions to the taxi\r\ndriver, who acknowledged them with a snort of contempt.\r\n\r\nThe taxi drew up before one of London’s more obscure hostelries. The\r\nfare, however, was paid on a scale befitting its point of departure.\r\n\r\nHaving booked a room in the name of Anthony Cade, Anthony passed into\r\na dingy writing-room, took out a sheet of notepaper stamped with the\r\nlegend Hotel Blitz, and wrote rapidly.\r\n\r\nHe explained that he had arrived on the preceding Tuesday, that he\r\nhad handed over the manuscript in question to Messrs. Balderson and\r\nHodgkins, and he regretfully declined the kind invitation of Lord\r\nCaterham as he was leaving England almost immediately. He signed the\r\nletter “Yours faithfully, James McGrath.”\r\n\r\n“And now,” said Anthony, as he affixed the stamp to the envelope. “To\r\nbusiness. Exit James McGrath, and Enter Anthony Cade.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\nA Dead Man\r\n\r\n\r\nOn that same Thursday afternoon Virginia Revel had been playing tennis\r\nat Ranelagh. All the way back to Pont Street, as she lay back in the\r\nlong, luxurious limousine, a little smile played upon her lips, as\r\nshe rehearsed her part in the forthcoming interview. Of course it\r\nwas within the bounds of possibility that the blackmailer might not\r\nreappear, but she felt pretty certain that he would. She had shown\r\nherself an easy prey. Well, perhaps this time there would be a little\r\nsurprise for him!\r\n\r\nWhen the car drew up at the house, she turned to speak to the chauffeur\r\nbefore going up the steps.\r\n\r\n“How’s your wife, Walton? I forgot to ask.”\r\n\r\n“Better I think, ma’am. The doctor said he’d look in and see her about\r\nhalf-past six. Will you be wanting the car again?”\r\n\r\nVirginia reflected for a minute.\r\n\r\n“I shall be away for the week-end. I’m going by the 6.40 from\r\nPaddington, but I shan’t need you again—a taxi will do for that. I’d\r\nrather you saw the doctor. If he thinks it would do your wife good to\r\ngo away for the week-end, take her somewhere, Walton. I’ll stand the\r\nexpense.”\r\n\r\nCutting short the man’s thanks with an impatient nod of the head,\r\nVirginia ran up the steps, delved into her bag in search of her\r\nlatchkey, remembered she hadn’t got it with her, and hastily rang the\r\nbell.\r\n\r\nIt was not answered at once, but as she waited there a young man came\r\nup the steps. He was shabbily dressed, and carried in his hand a sheaf\r\nof leaflets. He held one out to Virginia with the legend on it plainly\r\nvisible: “Why Did I Serve my Country?” In his left hand he held a\r\ncollecting-box.\r\n\r\n“I can’t buy two of those awful poems in one day,” said Virginia\r\npleadingly. “I bought one this morning. I did, indeed, honour bright.”\r\n\r\nThe young man threw back his head and laughed. Virginia laughed with\r\nhim. Running her eyes carelessly over him, she thought him a more\r\npleasing specimen than usual of London’s unemployed. She liked his\r\nbrown face, and the lean hardness of him. She went so far as to wish\r\nshe had a job for him.\r\n\r\nBut at that moment the door opened, and immediately Virginia forgot all\r\nabout the problem of the unemployed, for to her astonishment the door\r\nwas opened by her own maid, Élise.\r\n\r\n“Where’s Chilvers?” she demanded sharply, as she stepped into the hall.\r\n\r\n“But he is gone, madame, with the others.”\r\n\r\n“What others? Gone where?”\r\n\r\n“But to Datchet, madame—to the cottage, as your telegram said.”\r\n\r\n“My telegram?” said Virginia, utterly at sea.\r\n\r\n“Did not madame send a telegram? Surely there can be no mistake. It\r\ncame but an hour ago.”\r\n\r\n“I never sent any telegram. What did it say?”\r\n\r\n“I believe it is still on the table _là-bas_.”\r\n\r\nÉlise retired, pounced upon it, and brought it to her mistress in\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\n“_Voilà_, madame!”\r\n\r\nThe telegram was addressed to Chilvers and ran as follows:\r\n\r\n“Please take household down to cottage at once, and make preparations\r\nfor week-end party there. Catch 5.49 train.”\r\n\r\nThere was nothing unusual about it, it was just the sort of message she\r\nherself had frequently sent before, when she had arranged a party at\r\nher riverside bungalow on the spur of the moment. She always took the\r\nwhole household down, leaving an old woman as caretaker. Chilvers would\r\nnot have seen anything wrong with the message, and like a good servant\r\nhad carried out his orders faithfully enough.\r\n\r\n“Me, I remained,” explained Élise, “knowing that madame would wish me\r\nto pack for her.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a silly hoax,” cried Virginia, flinging down the telegram\r\nangrily. “You know perfectly well, Élise, that I am going to Chimneys.\r\nI told you so this morning.”\r\n\r\n“I thought madame had changed her mind. Sometimes that does happen,\r\ndoes it not, madame?”\r\n\r\nVirginia admitted the truth of the accusation with a half smile. She\r\nwas busy trying to find a reason for this extraordinary practical joke.\r\nÉlise cut forward a suggestion.\r\n\r\n“_Mon Dieu!_” she cried, clasping her hands. “If it should be the\r\nmalefactors, the thieves! They send the bogus telegram and get the\r\n_domestiques_ all out of the house, and then they rob it.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose that might be it,” said Virginia doubtfully.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, madame, that is it without a doubt. Every day you read in\r\nthe papers of such things. Madame will ring up the police at once—at\r\nonce—before they arrive and cut our throats.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t get so excited, Élise. They won’t come and cut our throats at\r\nsix o’clock in the afternoon.”\r\n\r\n“Madame, I implore you, let me run out and fetch a policeman now, at\r\nonce.”\r\n\r\n“What on earth for? Don’t be silly, Élise. Go up and pack my things\r\nfor Chimneys if you haven’t already done it. The new Cailleuax evening\r\ndress, and the white crêpe marocain, and—yes, the black velvet—black\r\nvelvet is so political, is it not?”\r\n\r\n“Madame looks ravishing in the eau de nil satin,” suggested Élise, her\r\nprofessional instincts reasserting themselves.\r\n\r\n“No, I won’t take that. Hurry up, Élise, there’s a good girl. We’ve got\r\nvery little time. I’ll send a wire to Chilvers at Datchet, and I’ll\r\nspeak to the policeman on the beat as we go out and tell him to keep an\r\neye on the place. Don’t start rolling your eyes again, Élise—if you\r\nget so frightened before anything has happened, what would you do if a\r\nman jumped out from some dark corner and stuck a knife into you?”\r\n\r\nÉlise gave vent to a shrill squeak, and beat a speedy retreat up the\r\nstairs, darting nervous glances over each shoulder as she went.\r\n\r\nVirginia made a face at her retreating back, and crossed the hall to\r\nthe little study where the telephone was. Élise’s suggestion of ringing\r\nup the police station seemed to her a good one, and she intended to act\r\nupon it without any further delay.\r\n\r\nShe opened the study door and crossed to the telephone. Then, with\r\nher hand on the receiver, she stopped. A man was sitting in the big\r\narm-chair, sitting in a curious huddled position. In the stress of the\r\nmoment, she had forgotten all about her expected visitor. Apparently he\r\nhad fallen asleep whilst waiting for her.\r\n\r\nShe came right up to the chair, a slightly mischievous smile upon her\r\nface. And then suddenly the smile faded.\r\n\r\nThe man was not asleep. _He was dead._\r\n\r\nShe knew it at once, knew it instinctively even before her eyes had\r\nseen and noted the small shining pistol lying on the floor, the\r\nlittle-singed hole just above the heart with the dark stain round it,\r\nand the horrible dropped jaw.\r\n\r\nShe stood quite still, her hands pressed to her sides. In the silence\r\nshe heard Élise running down the stairs.\r\n\r\n“Madame! Madame!”\r\n\r\n“Well, what is it?”\r\n\r\nShe moved quickly to the door. Her whole instinct was to conceal what\r\nhad happened—for the moment anyway—from Élise. Élise would promptly\r\ngo into hysterics, she knew that well enough, and she felt a great need\r\nfor calm and quiet in which to think things out.\r\n\r\n“Madame, would it not be better if I should draw the chain across the\r\ndoor? These malefactors, at any minute they may arrive.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, if you like. Anything you like.”\r\n\r\nShe heard the rattle of the chain, and then Élise running upstairs\r\nagain, and drew a long breath of relief.\r\n\r\nShe looked at the man in the chair and then at the telephone. Her\r\ncourse was quite clear, she must ring up the police at once.\r\n\r\nBut still she did not do so. She stood quite still, paralysed with\r\nhorror and with a host of conflicting ideas rushing through her brain.\r\nThe bogus telegram. Had it something to do with this? Supposing\r\nÉlise had not stayed behind? She would have let herself in—that is,\r\npresuming she had had her latchkey with her as usual, to find herself\r\nalone in the house with a murdered man—a man whom she had permitted to\r\nblackmail her on a former occasion. Of course she had an explanation of\r\nthat; but thinking of that explanation she was not quite easy in her\r\nmind. She remembered how frankly incredible George had found it. Would\r\nother people think the same. Those letters now—of course she hadn’t\r\nwritten them, but would it be so easy to prove that?\r\n\r\nShe put her hands on her forehead, squeezing them tight together.\r\n\r\n“I must think,” said Virginia. “I simply must think.”\r\n\r\nWho had let the man in? Surely not Élise. If she had done so, she would\r\nhave been sure to have mentioned the fact at once. The whole thing\r\nseemed more and more mysterious as she thought about it. There was\r\nreally only one thing to be done—ring up the police.\r\n\r\nShe stretched out her hand to the telephone, and suddenly she thought\r\nof George. A man—that was what she wanted—an ordinary level-headed,\r\nunemotional man who would see things in their proper proportion and\r\npoint out to her the best course to take.\r\n\r\nThen she shook her head. Not George. The first thing George would think\r\nof would be his own position. He would hate being mixed up in this\r\nkind of business. George wouldn’t do at all.\r\n\r\nThen her face softened. Bill, of course! Without more ado, she rang up\r\nBill.\r\n\r\nShe was informed that he had left half an hour ago for Chimneys.\r\n\r\n“Oh, damn!” cried Virginia, jamming down the receiver. It was horrible\r\nto be shut up with a dead body and to have no one to speak to.\r\n\r\nAnd at that minute the front-door bell rang.\r\n\r\nVirginia jumped. In a few minutes it rang again. Élise, she knew, was\r\nupstairs packing and wouldn’t hear it.\r\n\r\nVirginia went out in the hall, drew back the chain, and undid all the\r\nbolts that Élise had fastened in her zeal. Then, with a long breath,\r\nshe threw open the door. On the steps was the unemployed young man.\r\n\r\nVirginia plunged headlong with a relief born of overstrung nerves.\r\n\r\n“Come in,” she said. “I think that perhaps I’ve got a job for you.”\r\n\r\nShe took him into the dining-room, pulled toward a chair for him, sat\r\ndown herself facing him, and stared at him very attentively.\r\n\r\n“Excuse me,” she said, “but are you—I mean——”\r\n\r\n“Eton and Oxford,” said the young man. “That’s what you wanted to ask\r\nme, wasn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“Something of the kind,” admitted Virginia.\r\n\r\n“Come down in the world entirely through my own incapacity to stick to\r\nregular work. This isn’t regular work you’re offering me, I hope?”\r\n\r\nA smile hovered for a moment on her lips.\r\n\r\n“It’s very irregular.”\r\n\r\n“Good,” said the young man in a tone of satisfaction.\r\n\r\nVirginia noted his bronzed face and long lean body with approval.\r\n\r\n“You see,” she explained, “I’m in rather a hole, and most of my friends\r\nare—well, rather high up. They’ve all got something to lose.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve nothing whatever to lose. So go ahead. What’s the trouble?”\r\n\r\n“There’s a dead man in the next room,” said Virginia. “He’s been\r\nmurdered, and I don’t know what to do about it.”\r\n\r\nShe blurted out the words as simply as a child might have done.\r\nThe young man went up enormously in her estimation by the way he\r\naccepted her statement. He might have been used to hearing a similar\r\nannouncement made every day of his life.\r\n\r\n“Excellent,” he said, with a trace of enthusiasm. “I’ve always wanted\r\nto do a bit of amateur detective work. Shall we go and view the body,\r\nor will you give me the facts first?”\r\n\r\n“I think I’d better give you the facts.” She paused for a moment to\r\nconsider how best to condense her story, and then began, speaking\r\nquietly and concisely.\r\n\r\n“This man came to the house for the first time yesterday and asked to\r\nsee me. He had certain letters with him—love letters, signed with my\r\nname——”\r\n\r\n“But which weren’t written by you,” put in the young man quietly.\r\n\r\nVirginia looked at him in some astonishment\r\n\r\n“How did you know that?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I deduced it. But go on.”\r\n\r\n“He wanted to blackmail me—and I—well, I don’t know if you’ll\r\nunderstand, but I—let him.”\r\n\r\nShe looked at him appealingly, and he nodded his head reassuringly.\r\n\r\n“Of course I understand. You wanted to see what it felt like.”\r\n\r\n“How frightfully clever of you! That’s just what I did feel.”\r\n\r\n“I _am_ clever,” said the young man modestly. “But, mind you, very\r\nfew people would understand that point of view. Most people, you see,\r\nhaven’t got any imagination.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose that’s so. I told this man to come back to-day—at six\r\no’clock. I arrived home from Ranelagh to find that a bogus telegram had\r\ngot all the servants except my maid out of the house. Then I walked\r\ninto the study and found the man shot.”\r\n\r\n“Who let him in?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. I think if my maid had done so she would have told me.”\r\n\r\n“Does she know what has happened?”\r\n\r\n“I have told her nothing.”\r\n\r\nThe young man nodded, and rose to his feet.\r\n\r\n“And now to view the body,” he said briskly. “But I’ll tell you\r\nthis—on the whole it’s always best to tell the truth. One lie involves\r\nyou in such a lot of lies—and continuous lying is so monotonous.”\r\n\r\n“Then you advise me to ring up the police?”\r\n\r\n“Probably. But we’ll just have a look at the fellow first.”\r\n\r\nVirginia led the way out the room. On the threshold she paused, looking\r\nback at him.\r\n\r\n“By the way,” she said, “you haven’t told me your name yet?”\r\n\r\n“My name? My name’s Anthony Cade.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\nAnthony Disposes of a Body\r\n\r\n\r\nAnthony followed Virginia out of the room, smiling a little to himself.\r\nEvents had taken quite an unexpected turn. But as he bent over the\r\nfigure in the chair he grew grave again.\r\n\r\n“He’s still warm,” he said sharply. “He was killed less than half an\r\nhour ago.”\r\n\r\n“Just before I came in?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly.”\r\n\r\nHe stood upright, drawing his brows together in a frown. Then he asked\r\na question of which Virginia did not at once see the drift:\r\n\r\n“Your maid’s not been in this room, of course?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Does she know that you’ve been into it?”\r\n\r\n“Why—yes. I came to the door to speak to her.”\r\n\r\n“After you’d found the body.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And you said nothing?”\r\n\r\n“Would it have been better if I had? I thought she would go into\r\nhysterics—she’s French, you know, and easily upset—I wanted to think\r\nover the best thing to do.”\r\n\r\nAnthony nodded, but did not speak.\r\n\r\n“You think it a pity, I can see?”\r\n\r\n“Well, it was rather unfortunate, Mrs. Revel. If you and the maid had\r\ndiscovered the body together, immediately on your return, it would have\r\nsimplified matters very much. The man would then definitely have been\r\nshot _before_ your return to the house.”\r\n\r\n“Whilst now they might say he was shot _after_—I see—”\r\n\r\nHe watched her taking in the idea, and was confirmed in his first\r\nimpression of her formed when she had spoken to him on the steps\r\noutside. Besides beauty, she possessed courage and brains.\r\n\r\nVirginia was so engrossed in the puzzle presented to her that it did\r\nnot occur to her to wonder at this strange man’s ready use of her name.\r\n\r\n“Why didn’t Élise hear the shot, I wonder?” she murmured.\r\n\r\nAnthony pointed to the open window, as a loud backfire came from a\r\npassing car.\r\n\r\n“There you are. London’s not the place to notice a pistol shot.”\r\n\r\nVirginia turned with a little shudder to the body in the chair.\r\n\r\n“He looks like an Italian,” she remarked curiously.\r\n\r\n“He is an Italian,” said Anthony. “I should say that his regular\r\nprofession was that of a waiter. He only did blackmailing in his spare\r\ntime. His name might very possibly be Giuseppe.”\r\n\r\n“Good heavens!” cried Virginia. “Is this Sherlock Holmes?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Anthony regretfully. “I’m afraid it’s just plain or garden\r\ncheating. I’ll tell you all about it presently. Now you say this man\r\nshowed you some letters and asked you for money. Did you give him any?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I did.”\r\n\r\n“How much?”\r\n\r\n“Forty pounds.”\r\n\r\n“That’s bad,” said Anthony, but without manifesting any undue surprise.\r\n“Now let’s have a look at the telegram.”\r\n\r\nVirginia picked it up from the table and gave it to him. She saw his\r\nface grow grave as he looked at it.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?”\r\n\r\nHe held it out, pointing silently to the place of origin.\r\n\r\n“Barnes,” he said. “And you were at Ranelagh this afternoon. What’s to\r\nprevent you having sent it off yourself?”\r\n\r\nVirginia felt fascinated by his words. It was as though a net was\r\nclosing tighter and tighter round her. He was forcing her to see all\r\nthe things which she had felt dimly at the back of her mind.\r\n\r\nAnthony took out his handkerchief and wound it round his hand, then he\r\npicked up the pistol.\r\n\r\n“We criminals have to be so careful,” he said apologetically.\r\n“Fingerprints, you know.”\r\n\r\nSuddenly she saw his whole figure stiffen. His voice, when he spoke,\r\nhad altered. It was terse and curt.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Revel,” he said, “have you ever seen this pistol before?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Virginia wonderingly.\r\n\r\n“Are you sure of that?”\r\n\r\n“Quite sure.”\r\n\r\n“Have you a pistol of your own?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Have you ever had one?”\r\n\r\n“No, never.”\r\n\r\n“You are sure of that?”\r\n\r\n“Quite sure.”\r\n\r\nHe stared at her steadily for a minute, and Virginia stared back in\r\ncomplete surprise at his tone.\r\n\r\nThen, with a sigh, he relaxed.\r\n\r\n“That’s odd,” he said. “How do you account for this?”\r\n\r\nHe held out the pistol. It was a small, dainty article, almost a\r\ntoy—though capable of doing deadly work. Engraved on it was the name\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\n“Oh, it’s impossible!” cried Virginia.\r\n\r\nHer astonishment was so genuine that Anthony could but believe in it.\r\n\r\n“Sit down,” he said quietly. “There’s more in this than there seemed\r\nto be first go off. To begin with, what’s our hypothesis? There are\r\nonly two possible ones. There is, of course, the real Virginia of the\r\nletters. She may have somehow or other tracked him down, shot him,\r\ndropped the pistol, stolen the letters, and taken herself off. That’s\r\nquite possible, isn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose so,” said Virginia unwillingly.\r\n\r\n“The other hypothesis is a good deal more interesting. Whoever wished\r\nto kill Giuseppe, wished also to incriminate you—in fact that may have\r\nbeen their main object. They could get _him_ easily enough anywhere,\r\nbut they took extraordinary pains and trouble to get him _here_, and\r\nwhoever they were they knew all about you, your cottage at Datchet,\r\nyour usual household arrangements, and the fact that you were at\r\nRanelagh this afternoon. It seems an absurd question, but have you any\r\nenemies, Mrs. Revel?”\r\n\r\n“Of course I haven’t—not that kind, anyway.”\r\n\r\n“The question is,” said Anthony, “what are we going to do now? There\r\nare two courses open to us. A: Ring up the police, tell the whole\r\nstory, and trust to your unassailable position in the world and\r\nyour hitherto blameless life. B: An attempt on my part to dispose\r\nsuccessfully of the body. Naturally my private inclinations urge me\r\nto B. I’ve always wanted to see if I couldn’t conceal a crime with\r\nthe necessary cunning, but have had a squeamish objection to shedding\r\nblood. On the whole, I expect A’s the soundest. Then there’s a sort of\r\nbowdlerized A. Ring up the police, etc., but suppress the pistol and\r\nthe blackmailing letters—that is, if they are on him still.”\r\n\r\nAnthony ran rapidly through the dead man’s pockets.\r\n\r\n“He’s been stripped clean,” he announced. “There’s not a thing on him.\r\nThere’ll be dirty work at the crossroads over those letters yet. Hullo,\r\nwhat’s this? Hole in the lining—something got caught there, torn\r\nroughly out, and a scrap of paper left behind.”\r\n\r\nHe drew out the scrap of paper as he spoke, and brought it over to the\r\nlight. Virginia joined him.\r\n\r\n“Pity we haven’t got the rest of it,” he muttered. “_Chimneys 11.45\r\nThursday_—Sounds like an appointment.”\r\n\r\n“Chimneys?” cried Virginia. “How extraordinary!”\r\n\r\n“Why extraordinary? Rather high toned for such a low fellow?”\r\n\r\n“I’m going to Chimneys this evening. At least I was.”\r\n\r\nAnthony wheeled round on her.\r\n\r\n“What’s that? Say that again.”\r\n\r\n“I was going to Chimneys this evening,” repeated Virginia.\r\n\r\nAnthony stared at her.\r\n\r\n“I begin to see. At least, I may be wrong—but it’s an idea. Suppose\r\nsome one wanted badly to prevent your going to Chimneys?”\r\n\r\n“My cousin George Lomax does,” said Virginia with a smile. “But I can’t\r\nseriously suspect George of murder.”\r\n\r\nAnthony did not smile. He was lost in thought.\r\n\r\n“If you ring up the police, it’s good-bye to any idea of getting to\r\nChimneys to-day—or even to-morrow. And I should like you to go to\r\nChimneys. I fancy it will disconcert our unknown friends. Mrs. Revel,\r\nwill you put yourself in my hands?”\r\n\r\n“It’s to be Plan B, then?”\r\n\r\n“It’s to be Plan B. The first thing is to get that maid of yours out of\r\nthe house. Can you manage that?”\r\n\r\n“Easily.”\r\n\r\nVirginia went out in the hall and called up the stairs.\r\n\r\n“Élise. Élise.”\r\n\r\n“Madame?”\r\n\r\nAnthony heard a rapid colloquy, and then the front door opened and\r\nshut. Virginia came back into the room.\r\n\r\n“She’s gone. I sent her for some special scent—told her the shop in\r\nquestion was open until eight. It won’t be, of course. She’s to follow\r\nafter me by the next train without coming back here.”\r\n\r\n“Good,” said Anthony approvingly. “We can now proceed to the disposal\r\nof the body. It’s a time-worn method, but I’m afraid I shall have to\r\nask you if there’s such a thing in the house as a trunk?”\r\n\r\n“Of course there is. Come down to the basement and take your choice.”\r\n\r\nThere was a variety of trunks in the basement. Anthony selected a solid\r\naffair of suitable size.\r\n\r\n“I’ll attend to this part of it,” he said tactfully. “You go upstairs\r\nand get ready to start.”\r\n\r\nVirginia obeyed. She slipped out of her tennis kit, put on a soft brown\r\ntravelling dress and a delightful little orange hat, and came down to\r\nfind Anthony waiting in the hall with a neatly strapped trunk beside\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“I should like to tell you the story of my life,” he remarked, “but\r\nit’s going to be rather a busy evening. Now this is what you’ve got\r\nto do. Call a taxi, have your luggage put on it, including the trunk.\r\nDrive to Paddington. There have the trunk put in the Left Luggage\r\nOffice. I shall be on the platform. As you pass me, drop the Cloak\r\nRoom ticket. I will pick it up and pretend to return it to you, but in\r\nreality I shall keep it. Go on to Chimneys, and leave the rest to me.”\r\n\r\n“It’s awfully good of you,” said Virginia. “It’s really dreadful of me\r\nsaddling a perfect stranger with a dead body like this.”\r\n\r\n“I like it,” returned Anthony nonchalantly. “If one of my friends,\r\nJimmy McGrath, were here, he’d tell you that anything of this kind\r\nsuits me down to the ground.”\r\n\r\nVirginia was staring at him.\r\n\r\n“What name did you say? Jimmy McGrath?”\r\n\r\nAnthony returned her glance keenly.\r\n\r\n“Yes. Why? Have you heard of him?”\r\n\r\n“Yes—and quite lately.” She paused irresolutely, and then went on.\r\n“Mr. Cade, I must talk to you. Can’t you come down to Chimneys?”\r\n\r\n“You’ll see me before very long, Mrs. Revel—I’ll tell you that. Now,\r\nexit Conspirator A by back door slinkingly. Exit Conspirator B in\r\nblaze of glory by front door to taxi.”\r\n\r\nThe plan went through without a hitch. Anthony, having picked up a\r\nsecond taxi, was on the platform and duly retrieved the fallen ticket.\r\nHe then departed in search of a somewhat battered second-hand Morris\r\nCowley which he had acquired earlier in the day in case it should be\r\nnecessary to his plans.\r\n\r\nReturning to Paddington in this, he handed the ticket to the porter,\r\nwho got the trunk out of the cloak room and wedged it securely at the\r\nback of the car. Anthony drove off.\r\n\r\nHis objective now was out of London. Through Notting Hill, Shepherd’s\r\nBush, down Goldhawk Road, through Brentford and Hounslow till he came\r\nto the long stretch of road mid-way between Hounslow and Staines.\r\nIt was a well-frequented road, with motors passing continually. No\r\nfootmarks or tyre marks were likely to show. Anthony stopped the car at\r\na certain spot. Getting down, he first obscured the number-plate with\r\nmud. Then, waiting until he heard no car coming in either direction,\r\nhe opened the trunk, heaved out Giuseppe’s body, and laid it neatly\r\ndown by the side of the road, on the inside of a curve, so that the\r\nheadlights of passing motors would not strike on it.\r\n\r\nThen he entered the car again and drove away. The whole business had\r\noccupied exactly one minute and a half. He made a détour to the right,\r\nreturning to London by way of Burnham Beeches. There again he halted\r\nthe car, and choosing a giant of the forest he deliberately climbed the\r\nhuge tree. It was something of a feat, even for Anthony. To one of the\r\ntopmost branches, he affixed a small brown-paper parcel, concealing it\r\nin a little niche close to the bole.\r\n\r\n“A very clever way of disposing of the pistol,” said Anthony to himself\r\nwith some approval. “Everybody hunts about on the ground, and drags\r\nponds. But there are very few people in England who could climb that\r\ntree.”\r\n\r\nNext, back to London and Paddington Station. Here he left the trunk—at\r\nthe other cloak room this time, the one on the Arrival side. He thought\r\nlongingly of such things as good rumpsteaks, juicy chops, and large\r\nmasses of fried potatoes. But he shook his head ruefully, glancing at\r\nhis wrist watch. He fed the Morris with a fresh supply of petrol, and\r\nthen took the road once more. North this time.\r\n\r\nIt was just after half-past eleven that he brought the car to rest in\r\nthe road adjoining the park of Chimneys. Jumping out he scaled the wall\r\neasily enough, and set out towards the house. It took him longer than\r\nhe thought, and presently he broke into a run. A great grey mass loomed\r\nup out of the darkness—the venerable pile of Chimneys. In the distance\r\na stable clock chimed the three quarters.\r\n\r\n11.45—the time mentioned on the scrap of paper. Anthony was on the\r\nterrace now, looking up at the house. Everything seemed dark and quiet.\r\n\r\n“They go to bed early, these politicians,” he murmured to himself.\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly a sound smote upon his ears—the sound of a shot. Anthony\r\nspun round quickly. The sound had come from within the house—he was\r\nsure of that. He waited a minute, but everything was still as death.\r\nFinally he went up to one of the long French windows from where he\r\njudged the sound that had startled him had come. He tried the handle.\r\nIt was locked. He tried some of the other windows, listening intently\r\nall the while. But the silence remained unbroken.\r\n\r\nIn the end he told himself that he must have imagined the sound, or\r\nperhaps mistaken a stray shot coming from a poacher in the woods. He\r\nturned and retraced his steps across the park, vaguely dissatisfied and\r\nuneasy.\r\n\r\nHe looked back at the house, and whilst he looked a light sprang up in\r\none of the windows on the first floor. In another minute it went out\r\nagain, and the whole place was in darkness once more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\nChimneys\r\n\r\n\r\nInspector Badgworthy in his office. Time, 8.30 A.M. A tall portly\r\nman, Inspector Badgworthy, with a heavy regulation tread. Inclined to\r\nbreathe hard in moments of professional strain. In attendance Constable\r\nJohnson, very new to the Force, with a downy unfledged look about him,\r\nlike a human chicken.\r\n\r\nThe telephone on the table rang sharply, and the inspector took it up\r\nwith his usual portentous gravity of action.\r\n\r\n“Yes. Police station Market Basing. Inspector Badgworthy speaking.\r\nWhat?”\r\n\r\nSlight alteration in the inspector’s manner. As he is greater than\r\nJohnson, so others are greater than Inspector Badgworthy.\r\n\r\n“Speaking, my lord. I beg your pardon, my lord? I didn’t quite hear\r\nwhat you said?”\r\n\r\nLong pause, during which the inspector listens, quite a variety of\r\nexpressions passing over his usually impassive countenance. Finally he\r\nlays down the receiver, after a brief “At once, my lord.”\r\n\r\nHe turned to Johnson, seeming visibly swelled with importance.\r\n\r\n“From his lordship—at Chimneys—Murder.”\r\n\r\n“Murder,” echoed Johnson, suitably impressed.\r\n\r\n“Murder it is,” said the inspector, with great satisfaction.\r\n\r\n“Why, there’s never been a murder here—not that I’ve ever heard\r\nof—except the time that Tom Pearse shot his sweetheart.”\r\n\r\n“And that, in a manner of speaking, wasn’t murder at all, but drink,”\r\nsaid the inspector, deprecatingly.\r\n\r\n“He weren’t hanged for it,” agreed Johnson gloomily. “But this is the\r\nreal thing, is it, sir?”\r\n\r\n“It is, Johnson. One of his lordship’s guests, a foreign gentleman,\r\ndiscovered shot. Open window, and footprints outside.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry it were a foreigner,” said Johnson, with some regret.\r\n\r\nIt made the murder seem less real. Foreigners, Johnson felt, were\r\nliable to be shot.\r\n\r\n“His lordship’s in a rare taking,” continued the inspector. “We’ll get\r\nhold of Dr. Cartwright and take him up with us right away. I hope to\r\ngoodness no one will get messing with those footprints.”\r\n\r\nBadgworthy was in a seventh heaven. A murder! At Chimneys! Inspector\r\nBadgworthy in charge of the case. The police have a clue. Sensational\r\narrest. Promotion and kudos for the aforementioned inspector.\r\n\r\n“That is,” said Inspector Badgworthy to himself, “if Scotland Yard\r\ndoesn’t come butting in.”\r\n\r\nThe thought damped him momentarily. It seemed so extremely likely to\r\nhappen under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nThey stopped at Dr. Cartwright’s, and the doctor, who was a\r\ncomparatively young man, displayed a keen interest. His attitude was\r\nalmost exactly that of Johnson.\r\n\r\n“Why, bless my soul,” he exclaimed. “We haven’t had a murder here since\r\nthe time of Tom Pearse.”\r\n\r\nAll three of them got into the doctor’s little car, and started\r\noff briskly for Chimneys. As they passed the local inn, _The Jolly\r\nCricketers_, the doctor noticed a man standing in the doorway.\r\n\r\n“Stranger,” he remarked. “Rather a nice-looking fellow. Wonder how long\r\nhe’s been here, and what he’s doing staying at the _Cricketers_? I\r\nhaven’t seen him about at all. He must have arrived last night.”\r\n\r\n“He didn’t come by train,” said Johnson.\r\n\r\nJohnson’s brother was the local railway porter, and Johnson was\r\ntherefore always well up in arrivals and departures.\r\n\r\n“Who was there for Chimneys yesterday?” asked the inspector.\r\n\r\n“Lady Eileen, she come down by the 3.40, and two gentlemen with her,\r\nan American gent, and a young Army chap—neither of them with valets.\r\nHis lordship come down with a foreign gentleman, the one that’s been\r\nshot as likely as not, by the 5.40, and the foreign gentleman’s valet.\r\nMr. Eversleigh come by the same train. Mrs. Revel came by the 7.25, and\r\nanother foreign-looking gentleman came by it too, one with a bald head\r\nand a hook nose. Mrs. Revel’s maid came by the 8.56.”\r\n\r\nJohnson paused, out of breath.\r\n\r\n“And there was no one for the _Cricketers_?”\r\n\r\nJohnson shook his head.\r\n\r\n“He must have come by car then,” said the inspector. “Johnson, make\r\na note to institute inquiries at the _Cricketers_ on your way back.\r\nWe want to know all about any strangers. He was very sunburnt, that\r\ngentleman. Likely as not, he’s come from foreign parts too.”\r\n\r\nThe inspector nodded his head with great sagacity, as though to imply\r\nthat that was the sort of wide-awake man he was—not to be caught\r\nnapping under any consideration.\r\n\r\nThe car passed in through the Park gates of Chimneys. Descriptions of\r\nthat historic place can be found in any guide book. It is also No. 3\r\nin _Historic Homes of England_, price 21s. On Thursdays, chars-à-bancs\r\ncome over from Middlingham and view those portions of it which are open\r\nto the public. In view of all these facilities, to describe Chimneys\r\nwould be superfluous.\r\n\r\nThey were received at the door by a white-headed butler whose demeanour\r\nwas perfect.\r\n\r\n“We are not accustomed,” it seemed to say, “to having murder committed\r\nwithin these walls. But these are evil days. Let us meet disaster with\r\nperfect calm, and pretend with our dying breath that nothing out of the\r\nusual has occurred.”\r\n\r\n“His lordship,” said the butler, “is expecting you. This way, if you\r\nplease.”\r\n\r\nHe led them to a small cosy room which was Lord Caterham’s refuge from\r\nthe magnificence elsewhere, and announced them.\r\n\r\n“The police, my lord, and Dr. Cartwright.”\r\n\r\nLord Caterham was pacing up and down in a visibly agitated state.\r\n\r\n“Ha! inspector, you’ve turned up at last. I’m thankful for that. How\r\nare you, Cartwright? This is the very devil of a business, you know.\r\nThe very devil of a business.”\r\n\r\nAnd Lord Caterham, running his hands through his hair in a frenzied\r\nfashion until it stood upright in little tufts, looked even less like a\r\npeer of the realm than usual.\r\n\r\n“Where’s the body?” asked the doctor, in curt business-like fashion.\r\n\r\nLord Caterham turned to him as though relieved at being asked a direct\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n“In the council chamber—just where it was found—I wouldn’t have it\r\ntouched. I believed—er—that that was the correct thing to do.”\r\n\r\n“Quite right, my lord,” said the inspector approvingly.\r\n\r\nHe produced a notebook and pencil.\r\n\r\n“And who discovered the body? Did you?”\r\n\r\n“Good Lord, no,” said Lord Caterham. “You don’t think I usually get up\r\nat this unearthly hour in the morning, do you? No, a housemaid found\r\nit. She screamed a good deal, I believe. I didn’t hear her myself. Then\r\nthey came to me about it, and of course I got up and came down—and\r\nthere it was, you know.”\r\n\r\n“You recognized the body as that of one of your guests?”\r\n\r\n“That’s right, inspector.”\r\n\r\n“By name?”\r\n\r\nThis perfectly simple question seemed to upset Lord Caterham. He\r\nopened his mouth once or twice, and then shut it again. Finally he\r\nasked feebly.\r\n\r\n“Do you mean—do you mean—what was his name?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my lord.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Lord Caterham, looking slowly round the room, as though\r\nhoping to gain inspiration. “His name was—I should say it was—yes,\r\ndecidedly so—Count Stanislaus.”\r\n\r\nThere was something so odd about Lord Caterham’s manner, that the\r\ninspector ceased using his pencil and stared at him instead. But at\r\nthat moment a diversion occurred which seemed highly welcome to the\r\nembarrassed peer.\r\n\r\nThe door opened and a girl came into the room. She was tall, slim and\r\ndark, with an attractive boyish face, and a very determined manner.\r\nThis was Lady Eileen Brent, commonly known as Bundle, Lord Caterham’s\r\neldest daughter. She nodded to the others, and addressed her father\r\ndirectly.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got him,” she announced.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the inspector was on the point of starting forward\r\nunder the impression that the young lady had captured the murderer\r\nred-handed, but almost immediately he realized that her meaning was\r\nquite different.\r\n\r\nLord Caterham uttered a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n“That’s a good job. What did he say?”\r\n\r\n“He’s coming over at once. We are to ‘use the utmost discretion.’”\r\n\r\nHer father made a sound of annoyance.\r\n\r\n“That’s just the sort of idiotic thing George Lomax would say. However,\r\nonce he comes, I shall wash my hands of the whole affair.”\r\n\r\nHe appeared to cheer up a little at the prospect.\r\n\r\n“And the name of the murdered man was Count Stanislaus?” queried the\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\nA lightning glance passed between father and daughter, and then the\r\nformer said with some dignity:\r\n\r\n“Certainly. I said so just now.”\r\n\r\n“I asked because you didn’t seem quite sure about it before,” explained\r\nCartwright.\r\n\r\nThere was a faint twinkle in his eye, and Lord Caterham looked at him\r\nreproachfully.\r\n\r\n“I’ll take you to the Council Chamber,” he said more briskly.\r\n\r\nThey followed him, the inspector bringing up the rear, and darting\r\nsharp glances all around him as he went, much as though he expected to\r\nfind a clue in a picture frame, or behind a door.\r\n\r\nLord Caterham took a key from his pocket and unlocked a door, flinging\r\nit open. They all passed into a big room panelled in oak, with three\r\nlong windows giving on the terrace. There was a long refectory table\r\nand a good many oak chests, and some beautiful old chairs. On the walls\r\nwere various paintings of dead and gone Caterhams and others.\r\n\r\nNear the left-hand wall, about half-way between the door and the\r\nwindow, a man was lying on his back, his arms flung wide.\r\n\r\nDr. Cartwright went over and knelt down by the body. The inspector\r\nstrode across to the windows, and examined them in turn. The centre\r\none was closed, but not fastened. On the steps outside were footprints\r\nleading up to the window, and a second set going away again.\r\n\r\n“Clear enough,” said the inspector, with a nod. “But there ought to be\r\nfootprints on the inside as well. They’d show up plain on this parquet\r\nfloor.”\r\n\r\n“I think I can explain that,” interposed Bundle. “The housemaid had\r\npolished half the floor this morning before she saw the body. You\r\nsee, it was dark when she came in here. She went straight across to\r\nthe windows, drew the curtains, and began on the floor, and naturally\r\ndidn’t see the body which is hidden from that side of the room by the\r\ntable. She didn’t see it until she came right on top of it.”\r\n\r\nThe inspector nodded.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Lord Caterham, eager to escape. “I’ll leave you here,\r\ninspector. You’ll be able to find me if you—er—want me. But Mr.\r\nGeorge Lomax is coming over from Wyverne Abbey shortly, and he’ll be\r\nable to tell you far more than I could. It’s his business really. I\r\ncan’t explain, but he will when he comes.”\r\n\r\nLord Caterham beat a precipitate retreat without waiting for a reply.\r\n\r\n“Too bad for Lomax,” he complained. “Letting me in for this. What’s the\r\nmatter, Tredwell?”\r\n\r\nThe white-haired butler was hovering deferentially at his elbow.\r\n\r\n“I have taken the liberty, my lord, of advancing the breakfast hour as\r\nfar as you are concerned. Everything is ready in the dining-room.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t suppose for a minute I can eat anything,” said Lord Caterham\r\ngloomily, turning his footsteps in that direction. “Not for a moment.”\r\n\r\nBundle slipped her hand through his arm, and they entered the\r\ndining-room together. On the sideboard were half a score of heavy\r\nsilver dishes, ingeniously kept hot by patent arrangements.\r\n\r\n“Omelet,” said Lord Caterham, lifting each lid in turn. “Eggs and\r\nbacon, kidneys, devilled bird, haddock, cold ham, cold pheasant. I\r\ndon’t like any of these things, Tredwell, ask the cook to poach me an\r\negg, will you?”\r\n\r\n“Very good, my lord.”\r\n\r\nTredwell withdrew. Lord Caterham, in an absent-minded fashion, helped\r\nhimself plentifully to kidneys and bacon, poured himself out a cup of\r\ncoffee, and sat down at the long table. Bundle was already busy with a\r\nplateful of eggs and bacon.\r\n\r\n“I’m damned hungry,” said Bundle with her mouth full. “It must be the\r\nexcitement.”\r\n\r\n“It’s all very well for you,” complained her father. “You young people\r\nlike excitement. But I’m in a very delicate state of health. Avoid all\r\nworry, that’s what Sir Abner Willis said—avoid all worry. So easy for\r\na man sitting in his consulting-room in Harley Street to say that. How\r\ncan I avoid worry when that ass Lomax lands me with a thing like this?\r\nI ought to have been firm at the time. I ought to have put my foot\r\ndown.”\r\n\r\nWith a sad shake of the head, Lord Caterham rose and carved himself a\r\nplate of ham.\r\n\r\n“Codders has certainly done it this time,” observed Bundle cheerfully.\r\n“He was almost incoherent over the telephone. He’ll be here in a minute\r\nor two, spluttering nineteen to the dozen about discretion and hushing\r\nit up.”\r\n\r\nLord Caterham groaned at the prospect.\r\n\r\n“Was he up?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“He told me,” replied Bundle, “that he had been up and dictating\r\nletters and memoranda ever since seven o’clock.”\r\n\r\n“Proud of it, too,” remarked her father. “Extraordinarily selfish,\r\nthese public men. They make their wretched secretaries get up at the\r\nmost unearthly hours in order to dictate rubbish to them. If a law was\r\npassed compelling them to stop in bed until eleven, what a benefit it\r\nwould be to the nation! I wouldn’t mind so much if they didn’t talk\r\nsuch balderdash. Lomax is always talking to me of my ‘position.’ As if\r\nI had any. Who wants to be a peer nowadays?”\r\n\r\n“Nobody,” said Bundle. “They’d much rather keep a prosperous public\r\nhouse.”\r\n\r\nTredwell reappeared silently with two poached eggs in a little silver\r\ndish which he placed on the table in front of Lord Caterham.\r\n\r\n“What’s that, Tredwell?” said the latter, looking at them with faint\r\ndistaste.\r\n\r\n“Poached eggs, my lord.”\r\n\r\n“I hate poached eggs,” said Lord Caterham peevishly. “They’re so\r\ninsipid. I don’t like to look at them even. Take them away, will you,\r\nTredwell?”\r\n\r\n“Very good, my lord.”\r\n\r\nTredwell and the poached eggs withdrew as silently as they came.\r\n\r\n“Thank God no one gets up early in this house,” remarked Lord Caterham\r\ndevoutly. “We shall have to break this to them when they do, I suppose.”\r\n\r\nHe sighed.\r\n\r\n“I wonder who murdered him,” said Bundle. “And why?”\r\n\r\n“That’s not our business, thank goodness,” said Lord Caterham. “That’s\r\nfor the police to find out. Not that Badgworthy will ever find out\r\nanything. On the whole I rather hope it was Nosystein.”\r\n\r\n“Meaning——”\r\n\r\n“The All British Syndicate.”\r\n\r\n“Why should Mr. Isaacstein murder him when he’d come down here on\r\npurpose to meet him?”\r\n\r\n“High finance,” said Lord Caterham vaguely. “And that reminds me, I\r\nshouldn’t be at all surprised if Isaacstein wasn’t an early riser. He\r\nmay blow in upon us at any minute. It’s a habit in the city. I believe\r\nthat, however rich you are, you always catch the 9.17.”\r\n\r\nThe sound of a motor being driven at great speed was heard through the\r\nopen window.\r\n\r\n“Codders,” cried Bundle.\r\n\r\nFather and daughter leaned out of the window and hailed the occupant of\r\nthe car as it drew up before the entrance.\r\n\r\n“In here, my dear fellow, in here,” cried Lord Caterham, hastily\r\nswallowing his mouthful of ham.\r\n\r\nGeorge had no intention of climbing in through the window. He\r\ndisappeared through the front door, and reappeared ushered in by\r\nTredwell, who withdrew at once.\r\n\r\n“Have some breakfast,” said Lord Caterham, shaking him by the hand.\r\n“What about a kidney?”\r\n\r\nGeorge waved the kidney aside impatiently.\r\n\r\n“This is a terrible calamity, terrible, terrible.”\r\n\r\n“It is indeed. Some haddock?”\r\n\r\n“No, no. It must be hushed up—at all costs it must be hushed up.”\r\n\r\nAs Bundle had prophesied, George began to splutter.\r\n\r\n“I understand your feelings,” said Lord Caterham sympathetically. “Try\r\nan egg and bacon, or some haddock.”\r\n\r\n“A totally unforeseen contingency—national calamity—concessions\r\njeopardized——”\r\n\r\n“Take time,” said Lord Caterham. “And take some food. What you need\r\nis some food, to pull you together. Poached eggs now? There were some\r\npoached eggs here a minute or two ago.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want any food,” said George. “I’ve had breakfast, and even if\r\nI hadn’t had any I shouldn’t want it. We must think what is to be done.\r\nYou have told no one as yet?”\r\n\r\n“Well, there’s Bundle and myself. And the local police. And Cartwright.\r\nAnd all the servants of course.”\r\n\r\nGeorge groaned.\r\n\r\n“Pull yourself together, my dear fellow,” said Lord Caterham kindly.\r\n“(I wish you’d have some breakfast.) You don’t seem to realize that\r\nyou can’t hush up a dead body. It’s got be buried and all that sort of\r\nthing. Very unfortunate, but there it is.”\r\n\r\nGeorge became suddenly calm.\r\n\r\n“You are right, Caterham. You have called in the local police, you say?\r\nThat will not do. We must have Battle.”\r\n\r\n“Battle, murder and sudden death,” inquired Lord Caterham, with a\r\npuzzled face.\r\n\r\n“No, no, you misunderstand me. I referred to Superintendent Battle of\r\nScotland Yard. A man of the utmost discretion. He worked with us in\r\nthat deplorable business of the Party Funds.”\r\n\r\n“What was that?” asked Lord Caterham, with some interest.\r\n\r\nBut George’s eye had fallen upon Bundle, as she sat half in and half\r\nout of the window, and he remembered discretion just in time. He rose.\r\n\r\n“We must waste no time. I must send off some wires at once.”\r\n\r\n“If you write them out, Bundle will send them through the telephone.”\r\n\r\nGeorge pulled out a fountain pen and began to write with incredible\r\nrapidity. He handed the first one to Bundle, who read it with a great\r\ndeal of interest.\r\n\r\n“God! what a name,” she remarked. “Baron How Much?”\r\n\r\n“Baron Lolopretjzyl.”\r\n\r\nBundle blinked.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got it, but it will take some conveying to the post office.”\r\n\r\nGeorge continued to write. Then he handed his labours to Bundle and\r\naddressed the master of the house:\r\n\r\n“The best thing that you can do, Caterham——”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Lord Caterham apprehensively.\r\n\r\n“Is to leave everything in my hands.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” said Lord Caterham, with alacrity. “Just what I was\r\nthinking myself. You’ll find the police and Dr. Cartwright in the\r\nCouncil Chamber. With the—er—with the body, you know. My dear Lomax,\r\nI place Chimneys unreservedly at your disposal. Do anything you like.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” said George. “If I should want to consult you——”\r\n\r\nBut Lord Caterham had faded unobtrusively through the farther door.\r\nBundle had observed his retreat with a grim smile.\r\n\r\n“I’ll send off those telegrams at once,” she said. “You know your way\r\nto the Council Chamber?”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Lady Eileen.”\r\n\r\nGeorge hurried from the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Battle Arrives\r\n\r\n\r\nSo apprehensive was Lord Caterham of being consulted by George that he\r\nspent the whole morning making a tour of his estate. Only the pangs of\r\nhunger drew him homeward. He also reflected that by now the worst would\r\nsurely be over.\r\n\r\nHe sneaked into the house quietly by a small side door. From there he\r\nslipped neatly into his sanctum. He flattered himself that his entrance\r\nhad not been observed, but there he was mistaken. The watchful Tredwell\r\nlet nothing escape him. He presented himself at the door.\r\n\r\n“You’ll excuse me, my lord——”\r\n\r\n“What is it, Tredwell?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Lomax, my lord, is anxious to see you in the library as soon as\r\nyou return.”\r\n\r\nBy this delicate method Tredwell conveyed that Lord Caterham had not\r\nyet returned unless he chose to say so.\r\n\r\nLord Caterham sighed, and then rose.\r\n\r\n“I suppose it will have to be done sooner or later. In the library, you\r\nsay?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my lord.”\r\n\r\nSighing again, Lord Caterham crossed the wide spaces of his ancestral\r\nhome, and reached the library door. The door was locked. As he rattled\r\nthe handle, it was unlocked from inside, opened a little way, and the\r\nface of George Lomax appeared, peering out suspiciously.\r\n\r\nHis face changed when he saw who it was.\r\n\r\n“Ah, Caterham, come in. We were just wondering what had become of you.”\r\n\r\nMurmuring something vague about duties on the estate, repairs for\r\ntenants, Lord Caterham sidled in apologetically. There were two other\r\nmen in the room. One was Colonel Melrose, the Chief Constable. The\r\nother was a squarely built middle-aged man with a face so singularly\r\ndevoid of expression as to be quite remarkable.\r\n\r\n“Superintendent Battle arrived half an hour ago,” explained George. “He\r\nhas been round with Inspector Badgworthy, and seen Dr. Cartwright. He\r\nnow wants a few facts from us.”\r\n\r\nThey all sat down, after Lord Caterham had greeted Melrose and\r\nacknowledged his introduction to Superintendent Battle.\r\n\r\n“I need hardly tell you, Battle,” said George, “that this is a case in\r\nwhich we must use the utmost discretion.”\r\n\r\nThe superintendent nodded in an offhand manner that rather took Lord\r\nCaterham’s fancy.\r\n\r\n“That will be all right, Mr. Lomax. But no concealments from us. I\r\nunderstand that the dead gentleman was called Count Stanislaus—at\r\nleast, that that is the name by which the household knew him. Now was\r\nthat his real name?”\r\n\r\n“It was not.”\r\n\r\n“What was his real name?”\r\n\r\n“Prince Michael of Herzoslovakia.”\r\n\r\nBattle’s eyes opened just a trifle, otherwise he gave no sign.\r\n\r\n“And what, if I may ask the question, was the purpose of his visit\r\nhere? Just pleasure?”\r\n\r\n“There was a further object, Battle. All this in the strictest\r\nconfidence of course.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, Mr. Lomax.”\r\n\r\n“Colonel Melrose?”\r\n\r\n“Of course.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, Prince Michael was here for the express purpose of meeting\r\nMr. Herman Isaacstein. A loan was to be arranged on certain terms.”\r\n\r\n“Which were?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know the exact details. Indeed, they had not yet been\r\narranged. But in the event of coming to the throne, Prince Michael\r\npledged himself to grant certain oil concessions to those companies in\r\nwhich Mr. Isaacstein is interested. The British Government was prepared\r\nto support the claim of Prince Michael to the throne in view of his\r\npronounced British sympathies.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Superintendent Battle, “I don’t suppose I need go further\r\ninto it than that. Prince Michael wanted the money, Mr. Isaacstein\r\nwanted oil, and the British Government was ready to do the heavy\r\nfather. Just one question. Was anyone else after those concessions?”\r\n\r\n“I believe an American group of financiers had made overtures to His\r\nHighness.”\r\n\r\n“And been turned down, eh?”\r\n\r\nBut George refused to be drawn.\r\n\r\n“Prince Michael’s sympathies were entirely pro-British,” he repeated.\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Battle did not press the point.\r\n\r\n“Lord Caterham, I understand that this is what occurred yesterday. You\r\nmet Prince Michael in town and journeyed down here in company with him.\r\nThe Prince was accompanied by his valet, a Herzoslovakian named Boris\r\nAnchoukoff, but his equerry, Captain Andrassy, remained in town. The\r\nPrince, on arriving, declared himself greatly fatigued, and retired to\r\nthe apartments set aside for him. Dinner was served to him there, and\r\nhe did not meet the other members of the house party. Is that correct?”\r\n\r\n“Quite correct.”\r\n\r\n“This morning a housemaid discovered the body at approximately 7.45\r\nA.M. Dr. Cartwright examined the dead man and found that death was the\r\nresult of a bullet fired from a revolver. No revolver was found, and no\r\none in the house seems to have heard the shot. On the other hand the\r\ndead man’s wrist watch was smashed by the fall, and marks the crime as\r\nhaving been committed at exactly a quarter to twelve. Now what time\r\ndid you retire to bed last night?”\r\n\r\n“We went early. Somehow or other the party didn’t seem to ‘go’ if you\r\nknow what I mean, superintendent. We went up about half-past ten, I\r\nshould say.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you. Now I will ask you, Lord Caterham, to give me a description\r\nof all the people staying in the house.”\r\n\r\n“But, excuse me, I thought the fellow who did it came from outside?”\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Battle smiled.\r\n\r\n“I dare say he did. I dare say he did. But all the same I’ve got to\r\nknow who was in the house. Matter of routine, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Well, there was Prince Michael and his valet and Mr. Herman\r\nIsaacstein. You know all about them. Then there was Mr. Eversleigh——”\r\n\r\n“Who works in my department,” put in George condescendingly.\r\n\r\n“And who was acquainted with the real reason of Prince Michael’s being\r\nhere?”\r\n\r\n“No, I should not say that,” replied George weightily. “Doubtless\r\nhe realized that something was in the wind, but I did not think it\r\nnecessary to take him fully into my confidence.”\r\n\r\n“I see. Will you go on, Lord Caterham?”\r\n\r\n“Let me see, there was Mr. Hiram Fish.”\r\n\r\n“Who is Mr. Hiram Fish?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Fish is an American. He brought over a letter of introduction from\r\nMr. Lucius Gott—you’ve heard of Lucius Gott?”\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Battle smiled acknowledgment. Who had not heard of\r\nLucius C. Gott, the multi-millionaire?\r\n\r\n“He was specially anxious to see my first editions. Mr. Gott’s\r\ncollection is, of course, unequalled, but I’ve got several treasures\r\nmyself. This Mr. Fish was an enthusiast. Mr. Lomax had suggested that\r\nI ask one or two extra people down here this week-end to make things\r\nseem more natural, so I took the opportunity of asking Mr. Fish. That\r\nfinishes the men. As for the ladies, there is only Mrs. Revel—and I\r\nexpect she brought a maid or something like that. Then there was my\r\ndaughter, and of course the children and their nurses and governesses\r\nand all the servants.”\r\n\r\nLord Caterham paused and took a breath.\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” said the detective. “A mere matter of routine, but\r\nnecessary as such.”\r\n\r\n“There is no doubt, I suppose,” asked George ponderously, “that the\r\nmurderer entered by the window?”\r\n\r\nBattle paused for a minute before replying slowly.\r\n\r\n“There were footsteps leading up to the window, and footsteps leading\r\naway from it. A car stopped outside the park at 11.40 last night. At\r\ntwelve o’clock a young man arrived at the _Jolly Cricketers_ in a car,\r\nand engaged a room. He put his boots outside to be cleaned—they were\r\nvery wet and muddy, as though he had been walking through the long\r\ngrass in the park.”\r\n\r\nGeorge leant forward eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Could not the boots be compared with the footprints?”\r\n\r\n“They were.”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“They exactly correspond.”\r\n\r\n“That settles it,” cried George. “We have the murderer. The young\r\nman—what is his name, by the way?”\r\n\r\n“At the inn he gave the name of Anthony Cade.”\r\n\r\n“This Anthony Cade must be pursued at once, and arrested.”\r\n\r\n“You won’t need to pursue him,” said Superintendent Battle.\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Because he’s still there.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Curious, isn’t it?”\r\n\r\nColonel Melrose eyed him keenly.\r\n\r\n“What’s in your mind, Battle? Out with it.”\r\n\r\n“I just say it’s curious, that’s all. Here’s a young man who ought to\r\ncut and run, but he doesn’t cut and run. He stays here, and gives us\r\nevery facility for comparing footmarks.”\r\n\r\n“What do you think, then?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what to think. And that’s a very disturbing state of\r\nmind.”\r\n\r\n“Do you imagine——” began Colonel Melrose, but broke off as a discreet\r\nknock came at the door.\r\n\r\nGeorge rose and went to it. Tredwell, inwardly suffering from having to\r\nknock at doors in this low fashion, stood dignified upon the threshold,\r\nand addressed his master.\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, my lord, but a gentleman wishes to see you on urgent and\r\nimportant business, connected, I understand, with this morning’s\r\ntragedy.”\r\n\r\n“What’s his name?” asked Battle suddenly.\r\n\r\n“His name, sir, is Mr. Anthony Cade, but he said it wouldn’t convey\r\nanything to anybody.”\r\n\r\nIt seemed to convey something to the four men present. They all sat up\r\nin varying degrees of astonishment.\r\n\r\nLord Caterham began to chuckle.\r\n\r\n“I’m really beginning to enjoy myself. Show him in, Tredwell. Show him\r\nin at once.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12\r\n\r\nAnthony Tells His Story\r\n\r\n\r\n“Mr. Anthony Cade,” announced Tredwell.\r\n\r\n“Enter suspicious stranger from village inn,” said Anthony.\r\n\r\nHe made his way toward Lord Caterham with a kind of instinct rare in\r\nstrangers. At the same time he summed up the other three men in his\r\nown mind thus: “1, Scotland Yard. 2, Local dignitary—probably chief\r\nconstable. 3, Harassed gentleman on the verge of apoplexy—possibly\r\nconnected with the Government.”\r\n\r\n“I must apologize,” continued Anthony, still addressing Lord Caterham.\r\n“For forcing my way in like this, I mean. But it was rumoured round the\r\n_Jolly Dog_, or whatever the name of your local pub may be, that you\r\nhad had a murder up here, and as I thought I might be able to throw\r\nsome light upon it I came along.”\r\n\r\nFor a moment or two, no one spoke. Superintendent Battle because he was\r\na man of ripe experience who knew how infinitely better it was to let\r\nevery one else speak if they could be persuaded upon to do so, Colonel\r\nMelrose because he was habitually taciturn, George because he was in\r\nthe habit of having notice given him of the question, Lord Caterham\r\nbecause he had not the least idea of what to say. The silence of the\r\nother three, however, and the fact that he had been directly addressed,\r\nfinally forced speech upon the last named.\r\n\r\n“Er—quite so—quite so,” he said nervously. “Won’t—you—er—sit down?”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” said Anthony.\r\n\r\nGeorge cleared his throat portentously.\r\n\r\n“Er—when you say you can throw light upon this matter, you mean——?”\r\n\r\n“I mean,” said Anthony, “that I was trespassing upon Lord Caterham’s\r\nproperty (for which I hope he will forgive me) last night at about\r\n11.45, and that I actually heard the shot fired. I can at any rate fix\r\nthe time of the crime for you.”\r\n\r\nHe looked round at the three in turn, his eyes resting longest on\r\nSuperintendent Battle, the impassivity of whose face he seemed to\r\nappreciate.\r\n\r\n“But I hardly think that that’s news to you,” he added gently.\r\n\r\n“Meaning by that, Mr. Cade?” asked Battle.\r\n\r\n“Just this. I put on shoes when I got up this morning. Later, when I\r\nasked for my boots, I couldn’t have them. Some nice young constable had\r\ncalled round for them. So I naturally put two and two together, and\r\nhurried up here to clear my character if possible.”\r\n\r\n“A very sensible move,” said Battle non-committally.\r\n\r\nAnthony’s eyes twinkled a little.\r\n\r\n“I appreciate your reticence, inspector. It is inspector, isn’t it?”\r\n\r\nLord Caterham interposed. He was beginning to take a fancy to Anthony.\r\n\r\n“Superintendent Battle of Scotland Yard. This is Colonel Melrose, our\r\nChief Constable, and Mr. Lomax.”\r\n\r\nAnthony looked sharply at George.\r\n\r\n“Mr. George Lomax?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“I think, Mr. Lomax,” said Anthony, “that I had the pleasure of\r\nreceiving a letter from you yesterday.”\r\n\r\nGeorge stared at him.\r\n\r\n“I think not,” he said coldly.\r\n\r\nBut he wished that Miss Oscar were here. Miss Oscar wrote all his\r\nletters for him, and remembered who they were to and what they were\r\nabout. A great man like George could not possibly remember all these\r\nannoying details.\r\n\r\n“I think, Mr. Cade,” he hinted, “that you were about to give us\r\nsome—er—explanation of what you were doing in the grounds last night\r\nat 11.45?”\r\n\r\nHis tone said plainly: “And whatever it may be, we are not likely to\r\nbelieve it.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Mr. Cade, what _were_ you doing?” said Lord Caterham, with lively\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Anthony regretfully. “I’m afraid it’s rather a long story.”\r\n\r\nHe drew out his cigarette case.\r\n\r\n“May I?”\r\n\r\nLord Caterham nodded, and Anthony lit a cigarette, and braced himself\r\nfor the ordeal.\r\n\r\nHe was aware, none better, of the peril in which he stood. In the short\r\nspace of twenty-four hours, he had become embroiled in two separate\r\ncrimes. His actions in connection with the first would not bear looking\r\ninto for a second. After deliberately disposing of one body, and so\r\ndefeating the aims of justice, he had arrived upon the scene of the\r\nsecond crime at the exact moment when it was being committed. For a\r\nyoung man looking for trouble, he could hardly have done better.\r\n\r\n“South America,” thought Anthony to himself, “simply isn’t in it with\r\nthis!”\r\n\r\nHe had already decided upon his course of action. He was going to tell\r\nthe truth—with one trifling alteration, and one grave suppression.\r\n\r\n“The story begins,” said Anthony, “about three weeks ago—in Bulawayo.\r\nMr. Lomax, of course, knows where that is—outpost of the Empire—‘What\r\ndo we know of England who only England know?’ all that sort of thing. I\r\nwas conversing with a friend of mine, a Mr. James McGrath—”\r\n\r\nHe brought out the name slowly, with a thoughtful eye on George. George\r\nbounded in his seat and repressed an exclamation with difficulty.\r\n\r\n“The upshot of our conversation was that I came to England to carry\r\nout a little commission for Mr. McGrath, who was unable to go himself.\r\nSince the passage was booked in his name, I travelled as James\r\nMcGrath. I don’t know what particular kind of offence that was—the\r\nsuperintendent can tell me, I dare say, and run me in for so many\r\nmonths’ hard if necessary.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll get on with the story, if you please, sir,” said Battle, but his\r\neyes twinkled a little.\r\n\r\n“On arrival in London I went to the Blitz Hotel, still as James\r\nMcGrath. My business in London was to deliver a certain manuscript to a\r\nfirm of publishers, but almost immediately I received deputations from\r\nthe representatives of two political parties of a foreign kingdom. The\r\nmethods of one were strictly constitutional, the methods of the other\r\nwere not. I dealt with them both accordingly. But my troubles were not\r\nover. That night my room was broken into, and an attempt at burglary\r\nwas made by one of the waiters at the hotel.”\r\n\r\n“That was not reported to the police, I think?” said Superintendent\r\nBattle.\r\n\r\n“You are right. It was not. Nothing was taken, you see. But I did\r\nreport the occurrence to the manager of the hotel, and he will confirm\r\nmy story, and tell you that the waiter in question decamped rather\r\nabruptly in the middle of the night. The next day, the publishers\r\nrang me up, and suggested that one of their representatives would\r\ncall upon me and receive the manuscript. I agreed to this, and the\r\narrangement was duly carried out on the following morning. Since I\r\nhave heard nothing further, I presume the manuscript reached them\r\nsafely. Yesterday, still as James McGrath, I received a letter from Mr.\r\nLomax——”\r\n\r\nAnthony paused. He was by now beginning to enjoy himself. George\r\nshifted uneasily.\r\n\r\n“I remember,” he murmured. “Such a large correspondence. The name, of\r\ncourse, being different, I could not be expected to know. And I may\r\nsay,” George’s voice rose a little, firm in the assurance of moral\r\nstability, “that I consider this—this—masquerading as another man in\r\nthe highest degree improper. I have no doubt, no doubt whatever, that\r\nyou have incurred a severe legal penalty.”\r\n\r\n“In this letter,” continued Anthony, unmoved, “Mr. Lomax made various\r\nsuggestions concerning the manuscript in my charge. He also extended an\r\ninvitation to me from Lord Caterham to join the house party here.”\r\n\r\n“Delighted to see you, my dear fellow,” said that nobleman. “Better\r\nlate than never—eh?”\r\n\r\nGeorge frowned at him.\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Battle bent an unmoved eye upon Anthony.\r\n\r\n“And is that your explanation of your presence here last night, sir?”\r\nhe asked.\r\n\r\n“Certainly not,” said Anthony warmly. “When I am asked to stay at a\r\ncountry-house, I don’t scale the wall late at night, tramp across the\r\npark, and try the downstairs windows. I drive up to the front door,\r\nring the bell and wipe my feet on the mat. I will proceed. I replied to\r\nMr. Lomax’s letter, explaining that the manuscript had passed out of\r\nmy keeping, and therefore regretfully declining Lord Caterham’s kind\r\ninvitation. But after I had done so, I remembered something which had\r\nup till then escaped my memory.” He paused. The moment had come for\r\nskating over thin ice. “I must tell you that in my struggle with the\r\nwaiter Giuseppe, I had wrested from him a small bit of paper with some\r\nwords scribbled on it. They had conveyed nothing to me at the time, but\r\nI still had them, and the mention of Chimneys recalled them to me. I\r\ngot the torn scrap out and looked at it. It was as I had thought. Here\r\nis the piece of paper, gentlemen, you can see for yourselves. The words\r\non it are ‘_Chimneys 11.45 Thursday._’”\r\n\r\nBattle examined the paper attentively.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” continued Anthony, “the word Chimneys might have nothing\r\nwhatever to do with this house. On the other hand, it might. And\r\nundoubtedly this Giuseppe was a thieving rascal. I made up my mind to\r\nmotor down here last night, satisfy myself that all was as it should\r\nbe, put up at the inn, and call upon Lord Caterham in the morning and\r\nput him on his guard in case some mischief should be intended during\r\nthe week-end.”\r\n\r\n“Quite so,” said Lord Caterham encouragingly. “Quite so.”\r\n\r\n“I was late in getting here—had not allowed enough time. Consequently\r\nI stopped the car, climbed over the wall and ran across the park. When\r\nI arrived on the terrace, the whole house was dark and silent. I was\r\njust turning away when I heard a shot. I fancied that it came from\r\ninside the house, and I ran back, crossed the terrace, and tried the\r\nwindows. But they were fastened, and there was no sound of any kind\r\nfrom inside the house. I waited a while, but the whole place was still\r\nas the grave, so I made up my mind that I had made a mistake, and that\r\nwhat I had heard was a stray poacher—quite a natural conclusion to\r\ncome to under the circumstances, I think.”\r\n\r\n“Quite natural,” said Superintendent Battle expressionlessly.\r\n\r\n“I went on to the inn, put up as I said—and heard the news\r\nthis morning. I realized, of course, that I was a suspicious\r\ncharacter—bound to be under the circumstances, and came up here to\r\ntell my story, hoping it wasn’t going to be handcuffs for one.”\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. Colonel Melrose looked sideways at Superintendent\r\nBattle.\r\n\r\n“I think the story seems clear enough,” he remarked.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Battle. “I don’t think we’ll be handing out any handcuffs\r\nthis morning.”\r\n\r\n“Any questions, Battle?”\r\n\r\n“There’s one thing I’d like to know. What was this manuscript?”\r\n\r\nHe looked across at George, and the latter replied with a trace of\r\nunwillingness:\r\n\r\n“The Memoirs of the late Count Stylptitch. You see——”\r\n\r\n“You needn’t say anything more,” said Battle. “I see perfectly.”\r\n\r\nHe turned to Anthony.\r\n\r\n“Do you know who it was that was shot, Mr. Cade?”\r\n\r\n“At the _Jolly Dog_ it was understood to be a Count Stanislaus or some\r\nsuch name.”\r\n\r\n“Tell him,” said Battle laconically to George Lomax.\r\n\r\nGeorge was clearly reluctant, but he was forced to speak:\r\n\r\n“The gentleman who was staying here incognito as Count Stanislaus was\r\nHis Highness Prince Michael of Herzoslovakia.”\r\n\r\nAnthony whistled.\r\n\r\n“That must be deuced awkward,” he remarked.\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Battle, who had been watching Anthony closely, gave a\r\nshort grunt as though satisfied of something, and rose abruptly to his\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n“There are one or two questions I’d like to ask Mr. Cade,” he\r\nannounced. “I’ll take him into the Council Chamber with me if I may.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, certainly,” said Lord Caterham. “Take him anywhere you\r\nlike.”\r\n\r\nAnthony and the detective went out together.\r\n\r\nThe body had been removed from the scene of the tragedy. There was a\r\ndark stain on the floor where it had lain, but otherwise there was\r\nnothing to suggest that a tragedy had ever occurred. The sun poured in\r\nthrough the three windows, flooding the room with light, and bringing\r\nout the mellow tone of the old panelling. Anthony looked around him\r\nwith approval.\r\n\r\n“Very nice,” he commented. “Nothing much to beat old England, is there?”\r\n\r\n“Did it seem to you at first it was in this room the shot was fired?”\r\nasked the superintendent, not replying to Anthony’s eulogium.\r\n\r\n“Let me see.”\r\n\r\nAnthony opened the window and went out on the terrace, looking up at\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\n“Yes, that’s the room all right,” he said. “It’s built out, and\r\noccupies all the corner. If the shot had been fired anywhere else, it\r\nwould have sounded from the _left_, but this was from behind me or to\r\nthe right if anything. That’s why I thought of poachers. It’s at the\r\nextremity of the wing, you see.”\r\n\r\nHe stepped back across the threshold, and asked suddenly, as though the\r\nidea had just struck him:\r\n\r\n“But why do you ask? You know he was shot here, don’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said the superintendent. “We never know as much as we’d like to\r\nknow. But, yes, he was shot here all right. Now you said something\r\nabout trying the windows, didn’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. They were fastened from the inside.”\r\n\r\n“How many of them did you try?”\r\n\r\n“All three of them.”\r\n\r\n“Sure of that, sir?”\r\n\r\n“I’m in the habit of being sure. Why do you ask?”\r\n\r\n“That’s a funny thing,” said the superintendent.\r\n\r\n“What’s a funny thing?”\r\n\r\n“When the crime was discovered this morning, the middle one was\r\nopen—not latched, that is to say.”\r\n\r\n“Whew!” said Anthony, sinking down on the window seat, and taking\r\nout his cigarette case. “That’s rather a blow. That opens up quite\r\na different aspect of the case. It leaves us two alternatives.\r\nEither he was killed by some one in the house, and that some one\r\nunlatched the window after I had gone to make it look like an outside\r\njob—incidentally with me as Little Willie—or else, not to mince\r\nmatters, I’m lying. I dare say you incline to the second possibility,\r\nbut, upon my honour, you’re wrong.”\r\n\r\n“Nobody’s going to leave this house until I’m through with them, I can\r\ntell you that,” said Superintendent Battle grimly.\r\n\r\nAnthony looked at him keenly.\r\n\r\n“How long have you had the idea that it might be an inside job?” he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\nBattle smiled.\r\n\r\n“I’ve had a notion that way all along. Your trail was a bit\r\ntoo—flaring, if I may put it that way. As soon as your boots fitted\r\nthe footmarks, I began to have my doubts.”\r\n\r\n“I congratulate Scotland Yard,” said Anthony lightly.\r\n\r\nBut at that moment, the moment when Battle apparently admitted\r\nAnthony’s complete absence of complicity in the crime, Anthony felt\r\nmore than ever the need of being upon his guard. Superintendent Battle\r\nwas a very astute officer. It would not do to make any slip with\r\nSuperintendent Battle about.\r\n\r\n“That’s where it happened, I suppose?” said Anthony, nodding towards\r\nthe dark patch upon the floor.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“What was he shot with—a revolver?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but we shan’t know what make until they get the bullet out at the\r\nautopsy.”\r\n\r\n“It wasn’t found, then?”\r\n\r\n“No, it wasn’t found.”\r\n\r\n“No clues of any kind?”\r\n\r\n“Well, we’ve got this.”\r\n\r\nRather after the manner of a conjurer, Superintendent Battle produced\r\na half-sheet of notepaper. And, as he did so, he again watched Anthony\r\nclosely without seeming to do so.\r\n\r\nBut Anthony recognized the design upon it without any sign of\r\nconsternation.\r\n\r\n“Aha! Comrades of the Red Hand again. If they’re going to scatter this\r\nsort of thing about, they ought to have it lithographed. It must be a\r\nfrightful nuisance doing every one separately. Where was this found?”\r\n\r\n“Underneath the body. You’ve seen it before, sir?”\r\n\r\nAnthony recounted to him in detail his short encounter with that\r\npublic-spirited association.\r\n\r\n“The idea is, I suppose, that the Comrades did him in.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think it likely, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Well, it would be in keeping with their propaganda. But I’ve always\r\nfound that those who talk most about blood have never actually seen\r\nit run. I shouldn’t have said the Comrades had the guts myself. And\r\nthey’re such picturesque people too. I don’t see one of them disguising\r\nhimself as a suitable guest for a country house. Still, one never\r\nknows.”\r\n\r\n“Quite right, Mr. Cade. One never knows.”\r\n\r\nAnthony looked suddenly amused.\r\n\r\n“I see the big idea now. Open window, trail of footprints, suspicious\r\nstranger at village inn. But I can assure you, my dear superintendent,\r\nthat, whatever I am, I am not the local agent of the Red Hand.”\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Battle smiled a little. Then he played his last card.\r\n\r\n“Would you have any objection to seeing the body?” he shot out suddenly.\r\n\r\n“None whatever,” rejoined Anthony.\r\n\r\nBattle took a key from his pocket, and preceding Anthony down the\r\ncorridor, paused at a door and unlocked it. It was one of the smaller\r\ndrawing-rooms. The body lay on a table covered with a sheet.\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Battle waited until Anthony was beside him, and then\r\nwhisked away the sheet suddenly.\r\n\r\nAn eager light sprang into his eyes at the half-uttered exclamation and\r\nthe start of surprise which the other gave.\r\n\r\n“So you _do_ recognize him, Mr. Cade,” he said, in a voice that he\r\nstrove to render devoid of triumph.\r\n\r\n“I’ve seen him before, yes,” said Anthony, recovering himself. “But\r\nnot as Prince Michael Obolovitch. He purported to come from Messrs.\r\nBalderson and Hodgkins, and he called himself Mr. Holmes.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13\r\n\r\nThe American Visitor\r\n\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Battle replaced the sheet with the slightly crest-fallen\r\nair of a man whose best point has fallen flat. Anthony stood with his\r\nhands in his pockets lost in thought.\r\n\r\n“So that’s what old Lollipop meant when he talked about ‘other means,’”\r\nhe murmured at last.\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon, Mr. Cade?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing, superintendent. Forgive my abstraction. You see, I—or rather\r\nmy friend, Jimmy McGrath, has been very neatly done out of a thousand\r\npounds.”\r\n\r\n“A thousand pounds is a nice sum of money,” said Battle.\r\n\r\n“It isn’t the thousand pounds so much,” said Anthony, “though I agree\r\nwith you that it’s a nice sum of money. It’s being done that maddens\r\nme. I handed over that manuscript like a little woolly lamb. It hurts,\r\nsuperintendent, indeed it hurts.”\r\n\r\nThe detective said nothing.\r\n\r\n“Well, well,” said Anthony. “Regrets are vain, and all may not yet be\r\nlost. I’ve only got to get hold of dear old Stylptitch’s Reminiscences\r\nbetween now and next Wednesday and all will be gas and gaiters.”\r\n\r\n“Would you mind coming back to the Council Chamber, Mr. Cade? There’s\r\none little thing I want to point out to you.”\r\n\r\nBack in the Council Chamber, the detective strode over at once to the\r\nmiddle window.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been thinking, Mr. Cade. This particular window is very stiff,\r\nvery stiff indeed. You might have been mistaken in thinking that it was\r\nfastened. It might just have stuck. I’m sure—yes, I’m almost sure,\r\nthat you _were_ mistaken.”\r\n\r\nAnthony eyed him keenly.\r\n\r\n“And supposing I say that I’m quite sure I was not?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you think you could have been?” said Battle, looking at him very\r\nsteadily.\r\n\r\n“Well, to oblige you, superintendent, yes.”\r\n\r\nBattle smiled in a satisfied fashion.\r\n\r\n“You’re quick in the uptake, sir. And you’ll have no objection to\r\nsaying so, careless like, at a suitable moment?”\r\n\r\n“None whatever. I——”\r\n\r\nHe paused, as Battle gripped his arm. The superintendent was bent\r\nforward, listening.\r\n\r\nEnjoining silence on Anthony with a gesture, he tiptoed noiselessly to\r\nthe door, and flung it suddenly open.\r\n\r\nOn the threshold stood a tall man with black hair neatly parted in the\r\nmiddle, china blue eyes with a particularly innocent expression, and a\r\nlarge placid face.\r\n\r\n“Your pardon, gentlemen,” he said in a slow drawling voice with a\r\npronounced transatlantic accent. “But is it permitted to inspect the\r\nscene of the crime? I take it that you are both gentlemen from Scotland\r\nYard?”\r\n\r\n“I have not that honour,” said Anthony. “But this gentleman is\r\nSuperintendent Battle of Scotland Yard.”\r\n\r\n“Is that so?” said the American gentleman, with a great appearance of\r\ninterest. “Pleased to meet you, sir. My name is Hiram P. Fish, of New\r\nYork City.”\r\n\r\n“What was it you wanted to see, Mr. Fish?” asked the detective.\r\n\r\nThe American walked gently into the room, and looked with much interest\r\nat the dark patch on the floor.\r\n\r\n“I am interested in crime, Mr. Battle. It is one of my hobbies. I have\r\ncontributed a monograph to one of our weekly periodicals on the subject\r\n‘Degeneracy and the Criminal.’”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, his eyes went gently round the room, seeming to note\r\neverything in it. They rested just a shade longer on the window.\r\n\r\n“The body,” said Superintendent Battle, stating a self-evident fact,\r\n“has been removed.”\r\n\r\n“Surely,” said Mr. Fish. His eyes went on to the panelled walls.\r\n“Some remarkable pictures in this room, gentlemen. A Holbein, two\r\nVan Dycks, and, if I am not mistaken, a Velasquez. I am interested\r\nin pictures—and likewise in first editions. It was to see his first\r\neditions that Lord Caterham was so kind as to invite me down here.”\r\n\r\nHe sighed gently.\r\n\r\n“I guess that’s all off now. It would show a proper feeling I suppose,\r\nfor the guests to return to town immediately?”\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid that can’t be done, sir,” said Superintendent Battle.\r\n“Nobody must leave the house until after the inquest.”\r\n\r\n“Is that so? And when is the inquest?”\r\n\r\n“May be to-morrow, may not be until Monday. We’ve got to arrange for\r\nthe autopsy and see the Coroner.”\r\n\r\n“I get you,” said Mr. Fish. “Under the circumstances, though, it will\r\nbe a melancholy party.”\r\n\r\nBattle led the way to the door.\r\n\r\n“We’d best get out of here,” he said. “We’re keeping it locked still.”\r\n\r\nHe waited for the other two to pass through, and then turned the key\r\nand removed it.\r\n\r\n“I opine,” said Mr. Fish, “that you are seeking for fingerprints?”\r\n\r\n“Maybe,” said the superintendent laconically.\r\n\r\n“I should say to that, on a night such as last night, an intruder would\r\nhave left footprints on the hardwood floor.”\r\n\r\n“None inside, plenty outside.”\r\n\r\n“Mine,” explained Anthony cheerfully.\r\n\r\nThe innocent eyes of Mr. Fish swept over him.\r\n\r\n“Young man,” he said, “you surprise me.”\r\n\r\nThey turned a corner, and came out into the big wide hall, panelled like\r\nthe Council Chamber in old oak, and with a wide gallery above it. Two\r\nother figures came into sight at the far end.\r\n\r\n“Aha!” said Mr. Fish. “Our genial host.”\r\n\r\nThis was such a ludicrous description of Lord Caterham that Anthony had\r\nto turn his head away to conceal a smile.\r\n\r\n“And with him,” continued the American, “is a lady whose name I did not\r\ncatch last night. But she is bright—she is very bright.”\r\n\r\nWith Lord Caterham was Virginia Revel.\r\n\r\nAnthony had been anticipating this meeting all along. He had no\r\nidea how to act. He must leave it to Virginia. Although he had full\r\nconfidence in her presence of mind, he had not the slightest idea what\r\nline she would take. He was not long left in doubt.\r\n\r\n“Why, it’s Mr. Cade,” said Virginia. She held out both hands to him.\r\n“So you found you could come down after all?”\r\n\r\n“My dear Mrs. Revel, I had no idea Mr. Cade was a friend of yours,”\r\nsaid Lord Caterham.\r\n\r\n“He’s a very old friend,” said Virginia, smiling at Anthony with a\r\nmischievous glint in her eye. “I ran across him in London unexpectedly\r\nyesterday, and told him I was coming down here.”\r\n\r\nAnthony was quick to give her her pointer.\r\n\r\n“I explained to Mrs. Revel,” he said, “that I had been forced to refuse\r\nyour kind invitation—since it had really been extended to quite a\r\ndifferent man. And I couldn’t very well foist a perfect stranger on you\r\nunder false pretences.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well, my dear fellow,” said Lord Caterham, “that’s all over and\r\ndone with now. I’ll send down to the _Cricketers_ for your bag.”\r\n\r\n“It’s very kind of you, Lord Caterham, but——”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense, of course you must come to Chimneys. Horrible place, the\r\n_Cricketers_—to stay in, I mean.”\r\n\r\n“Of course you must come, Mr. Cade,” said Virginia softly.\r\n\r\nAnthony realized the altered tone of his surroundings. Already Virginia\r\nhad done much for him. He was no longer an ambiguous stranger. Her\r\nposition was so assured and unassailable that anyone for whom she\r\nvouched was accepted as a matter of course. He thought of the pistol in\r\nthe tree at Burnham Beeches, and smiled inwardly.\r\n\r\n“I’ll send for your traps,” said Lord Caterham to Anthony. “I suppose,\r\nin the circumstances, we can’t have any shooting. A pity. But there it\r\nis. And I don’t know what the devil to do with Isaacstein. It’s all\r\nvery unfortunate.”\r\n\r\nThe depressed peer sighed heavily.\r\n\r\n“That’s settled, then,” said Virginia. “You can begin to be useful\r\nright away, Mr. Cade, and take me out on the lake. It’s very peaceful\r\nthere and far from crime and all that sort of thing. Isn’t it awful for\r\npoor Lord Caterham having a murder done in his house? But it’s George’s\r\nfault really. This is George’s party, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Lord Caterham. “But I should never have listened to him!”\r\n\r\nHe assumed the air of a strong man betrayed by a single weakness.\r\n\r\n“One can’t help listening to George,” said Virginia. “He always holds\r\nyou so that you can’t get away. I’m thinking of patenting a detachable\r\nlapel.”\r\n\r\n“I wish you would,” chuckled her host. “I’m glad you’re coming to us,\r\nCade. I need support.”\r\n\r\n“I appreciate your kindness very much, Lord Caterham,” said Anthony.\r\n“Especially,” he added, “when I’m such a suspicious character. But my\r\nstaying here makes it easier for Battle.”\r\n\r\n“In what way, sir?” asked the superintendent.\r\n\r\n“It won’t be so difficult to keep an eye on me,” explained Anthony\r\ngently.\r\n\r\nAnd by the momentary flicker of the superintendent’s eyelids he knew\r\nthat his shot had gone home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14\r\n\r\nMainly Political and Financial\r\n\r\n\r\nExcept for that involuntary twitch of the eyelids, Superintendent\r\nBattle’s impassivity was unimpaired. If he had been surprised at\r\nVirginia’s recognition of Anthony, he did not show it. He and Lord\r\nCaterham stood together and watched those two go out through the garden\r\ndoor. Mr. Fish also watched them.\r\n\r\n“Nice young fellow, that,” said Lord Caterham.\r\n\r\n“Vurry nice for Mrs. Revel to meet an old friend,” murmured the\r\nAmerican. “They have been acquainted some time, presoomably?”\r\n\r\n“Seems so,” said Lord Caterham. “But I’ve never heard her mention him\r\nbefore. Oh, by the way, Battle, Mr. Lomax has been asking for you. He’s\r\nin the Blue morning-room.”\r\n\r\n“Very good, Lord Caterham. I’ll go there at once.”\r\n\r\nBattle found his way to the Blue morning-room without difficulty. He\r\nwas already familiar with the geography of the house.\r\n\r\n“Ah, there you are, Battle,” said Lomax.\r\n\r\nHe was striding impatiently up and down the carpet. There was one other\r\nperson in the room, a big man sitting in a chair by the fireplace. He\r\nwas dressed in very correct English shooting clothes which nevertheless\r\nsat strangely upon him. He had a fat yellow face, and black eyes, as\r\nimpenetrable as those of a cobra. There was a generous curve to the big\r\nnose and power in the square lines of the vast jaw.\r\n\r\n“Come in, Battle,” said Lomax irritably. “And shut the door behind\r\nyou. This is Mr. Herman Isaacstein.”\r\n\r\nBattle inclined his head respectfully.\r\n\r\nHe knew all about Mr. Herman Isaacstein, and though the great financier\r\nsat there silent, whilst Lomax strode up and down and talked, he knew\r\nwho was the real power in the room.\r\n\r\n“We can speak more freely now,” said Lomax. “Before Lord Caterham and\r\nColonel Melrose, I was anxious not to say too much. You understand,\r\nBattle? These things mustn’t get about.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Battle. “But they always do, more’s the pity.”\r\n\r\nJust for a second he saw a trace of a smile on the fat yellow face. It\r\ndisappeared as suddenly as it had come.\r\n\r\n“Now what do you really think of this young fellow—this Anthony Cade?”\r\ncontinued George. “Do you still assume him to be innocent?”\r\n\r\nBattle shrugged his shoulders very slightly.\r\n\r\n“He tells a straight story. Part of it we shall be able to verify.\r\nOn the face of it, it accounts for his presence here last night. I\r\nshall cable to South Africa, of course, for information about his\r\nantecedents.”\r\n\r\n“Then you regard him as cleared of all complicity?”\r\n\r\nBattle raised a large square hand.\r\n\r\n“Not so fast, sir. I never said that.”\r\n\r\n“What is your own idea about the crime, Superintendent Battle?” asked\r\nIsaacstein, speaking for the first time.\r\n\r\nHis voice was deep and rich, and had a certain compelling quality about\r\nit. It had stood him in good stead at board meetings in his younger\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n“It’s rather too soon to have ideas, Mr. Isaacstein. I’ve not got\r\nbeyond asking myself the first question.”\r\n\r\n“What is that?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, it’s always the same. Motive. Who benefits by the death of Prince\r\nMichael? We’ve got to answer that before we can get anywhere.”\r\n\r\n“The Revolutionary party of Herzoslovakia——” began George.\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Battle waved him aside with something less than his\r\nusual respect.\r\n\r\n“It wasn’t the Comrades of the Red Hand, sir, if you’re thinking of\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\n“But the paper—with the scarlet hand on it?”\r\n\r\n“Put there to suggest the obvious solution.”\r\n\r\nGeorge’s dignity was a little ruffled.\r\n\r\n“Really, Battle, I don’t see how you can be so sure of that.”\r\n\r\n“Bless you, Mr. Lomax, we know all about the Comrades of the Red Hand.\r\nWe’ve had our eye on them ever since Prince Michael landed in England.\r\nThat sort of thing is the elementary work of the department. They’d\r\nnever be allowed to get within a mile of him.”\r\n\r\n“I agree with Superintendent Battle,” said Isaacstein. “We must look\r\nelsewhere.”\r\n\r\n“You see, sir,” said Battle, encouraged by his support, “we do know a\r\nlittle about the case. If we don’t know who gains by his death, we do\r\nknow who loses by it.”\r\n\r\n“Meaning?” said Isaacstein.\r\n\r\nHis black eyes were bent upon the detective. More than ever, he\r\nreminded Battle of a hooded cobra.\r\n\r\n“You and Mr. Lomax, not to mention the Loyalist party of Herzoslovakia.\r\nIf you’ll pardon the expression, sir, you’re in the soup.”\r\n\r\n“Really, Battle,” interposed George, shocked to the core.\r\n\r\n“Go on, Battle,” said Isaacstein. “In the soup describes the situation\r\nvery accurately. You’re an intelligent man.”\r\n\r\n“You’ve got to have a King. You’ve lost your King—like that!” He\r\nsnapped his large fingers. “You’ve got to find another in a hurry, and\r\nthat’s not an easy job. No, I don’t want to know the details of your\r\nscheme, the bare outline is enough for me, but, I take it, it’s a big\r\ndeal?”\r\n\r\nIsaacstein bent his head slowly.\r\n\r\n“It’s a very big deal.”\r\n\r\n“That brings me to my second question. Who is the next heir to the\r\nthrone of Herzoslovakia?”\r\n\r\nIsaacstein looked across at Lomax. The latter answered the question,\r\nwith a certain reluctance, and a good deal of hesitation:\r\n\r\n“That would be—I should say—yes, in all probability Prince Nicholas\r\nwould be the next heir.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Battle. “And who is Prince Nicholas?”\r\n\r\n“A first cousin of Prince Michael’s.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Battle. “I should like to hear all about Prince Nicholas,\r\nespecially where he is at present.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing much is known of him,” said Lomax. “As a young man, he was\r\nmost peculiar in his ideas, consorted with Socialists and Republicans,\r\nand acted in a way highly unbecoming to his position. He was sent down\r\nfrom Oxford, I believe, for some wild escapade. There was a rumour\r\nof his death two years later in the Congo, but it was only a rumour.\r\nHe turned up a few months ago when news of the Royalist reaction got\r\nabout.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?” said Battle. “Where did he turn up?”\r\n\r\n“In America.”\r\n\r\n“America!”\r\n\r\nBattle turned to Isaacstein with one laconic word:\r\n\r\n“Oil?”\r\n\r\nThe financier nodded.\r\n\r\n“He represented that if the Herzoslovakians chose a King, they would\r\nprefer him to Prince Michael as being more in sympathy with modern\r\nenlightened ideas, and he drew attention to his early democratic views\r\nand his sympathy with Republican ideals. In return for financial\r\nsupport, he was prepared to grant concessions to a certain group of\r\nAmerican financiers.”\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Battle so far forgot his habitual impassivity as to give\r\nvent to a prolonged whistle.\r\n\r\n“So that is it,” he muttered. “In the meantime, the Loyalist party\r\nsupported Prince Michael, and you felt sure you’d come out on top. And\r\nthen this happens!”\r\n\r\n“You surely don’t think——” began George.\r\n\r\n“It was a big deal,” said Battle. “Mr. Isaacstein says so. And I\r\nshould say that what he calls a big deal _is_ a big deal.”\r\n\r\n“There are always unscrupulous tools to be got hold of,” said\r\nIsaacstein quietly. “For the moment, Wall Street wins. But they’ve not\r\ndone with me yet. Find out who killed Prince Michael, Superintendent\r\nBattle, if you want to do your country a service.”\r\n\r\n“One thing strikes me as highly suspicious,” put in George. “Why did\r\nthe equerry, Captain Andrassy, not come down with the Prince yesterday?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve inquired into that,” said Battle. “It’s perfectly simple. He\r\nstayed in town to make arrangements with a certain lady, on behalf of\r\nPrince Michael, for next week-end. The Baron rather frowned on such\r\nthings, thinking them injudicious at the present stage of affairs, so\r\nHis Highness had to go about them in a hole and corner manner. He was,\r\nif I may say so, inclined to be a rather—er—dissipated young man.”\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid so,” said George ponderously. “Yes, I’m afraid so.”\r\n\r\n“There’s one other point we ought to take into account, I think,” said\r\nBattle, speaking with a certain amount of hesitation. “King Victor’s\r\nsupposed to be in England.”\r\n\r\n“King Victor?”\r\n\r\nLomax frowned in an effort at recollection.\r\n\r\n“Notorious French crook, sir. We’ve had a warning from the Sûreté in\r\nParis.”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said George. “I remember now. Jewel thief, isn’t he? Why,\r\nthat’s the man——”\r\n\r\nHe broke off abruptly. Isaacstein, who had been frowning abstractedly\r\nat the fireplace, looked up just too late to catch the warning glance\r\ntelegraphed from Superintendent Battle to the other. But being a man\r\nsensitive to vibrations in the atmosphere, he was conscious of a sense\r\nof strain.\r\n\r\n“You don’t want me any longer, do you, Lomax?” he inquired.\r\n\r\n“No, thank you, my dear fellow.”\r\n\r\n“Would it upset your plans if I returned to London, Superintendent\r\nBattle?”\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid so, sir,” said the Superintendent civilly. “You see, if you\r\ngo, there will be others who’ll want to go also. And that would never\r\ndo.”\r\n\r\n“Quite so.”\r\n\r\nThe great financier left the room, closing the door behind him.\r\n\r\n“Splendid fellow, Isaacstein,” murmured George Lomax perfunctorily.\r\n\r\n“Very powerful personality,” agreed Superintendent Battle.\r\n\r\nGeorge began to pace up and down again.\r\n\r\n“What you say disturbs me greatly,” he began. “King Victor! I thought\r\nhe was in prison?”\r\n\r\n“Came out a few months ago. French police meant to keep on his heels,\r\nbut he managed to give them the slip straight away. He would too. One\r\nof the coolest customers that ever lived. For some reason or other,\r\nthey believe he’s in England, and have notified us to that effect.”\r\n\r\n“But what should he be doing in England?”\r\n\r\n“That’s for you to say, sir,” said Battle significantly.\r\n\r\n“You mean——? You think——? You know the story, of course—ah, yes,\r\nI can see you do. I was not in office, of course, at the time, but I\r\nheard the whole story from the late Lord Caterham. An unparalleled\r\ncatastrophe.”\r\n\r\n“The Koh-i-noor,” said Battle reflectively.\r\n\r\n“Hush, Battle!” George glanced suspiciously round him. “I beg of you,\r\nmention no names. Much better not. If you must speak of it, call it the\r\nK.”\r\n\r\nThe superintendent looked wooden again.\r\n\r\n“You don’t connect King Victor with this crime, do you, Battle?”\r\n\r\n“It’s just a possibility, that’s all. If you’ll cast your mind back,\r\nsir, you’ll remember that there were four places where a—er—certain\r\nRoyal visitor might have concealed the jewel. Chimneys was one of them.\r\nKing Victor was arrested in Paris three days after the—disappearance,\r\nif I may call it that, of the K. It was always hoped that he would some\r\nday lead us to the jewel.”\r\n\r\n“But Chimneys has been ransacked and overhauled a dozen times.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Battle sapiently. “But it’s never much good looking when\r\nyou don’t know where to look. Only suppose now, that this King Victor\r\ncame here to look for the thing, was surprised by Prince Michael, and\r\nshot him.”\r\n\r\n“It’s possible,” said George. “A most likely solution of the crime.”\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t go as far as that. It’s possible, but not much more.”\r\n\r\n“Why is that?”\r\n\r\n“Because King Victor has never been known to take a life,” said Battle\r\nseriously.\r\n\r\n“Oh, but a man like that—a dangerous criminal——”\r\n\r\nBut Battle shook his head in a dissatisfied manner.\r\n\r\n“Criminals always act true to type, Mr. Lomax. It’s surprising. All the\r\nsame——”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“I’d rather like to question the Prince’s servant. I’ve left him\r\npurposely to the last. We’ll have him in here, sir, if you don’t mind.”\r\n\r\nGeorge signified his assent. The superintendent rang the bell. Tredwell\r\nanswered it, and departed with his instructions.\r\n\r\nHe returned shortly accompanied by a tall fair man with high\r\ncheek-bones, and very deep-set blue eyes, and an impassivity of\r\ncountenance which almost rivalled Battle’s.\r\n\r\n“Boris Anchoukoff?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“You were valet to Prince Michael?”\r\n\r\n“I was His Highness’s valet, yes.”\r\n\r\nThe man spoke good English, though with a markedly harsh foreign accent.\r\n\r\n“You know that your master was murdered last night?”\r\n\r\nA deep snarl, like the snarl of a wild beast, was the man’s only\r\nanswer. It alarmed George, who withdrew prudently towards the window.\r\n\r\n“When did you see your master last?”\r\n\r\n“His Highness retired to bed at half-past ten. I slept, as always,\r\nin the ante-room next to him. He must have gone down to the room\r\ndownstairs by the other door, the door that gave on to the corridor.\r\nI did not hear him go. It may be that I was drugged. I have been an\r\nunfaithful servant, I slept while my master woke. I am accursed.”\r\n\r\nGeorge gazed at him, fascinated.\r\n\r\n“You loved your master, eh?” said Battle, watching the man closely.\r\n\r\nBoris’s features contracted painfully. He swallowed twice. Then his\r\nvoice came, harsh with emotion.\r\n\r\n“I say this to you, English Policeman, I would have died for him! And\r\nsince he is dead, and I still live, my eyes shall not know sleep, or\r\nmy heart rest, until I have avenged him. Like a dog will I nose out\r\nhis murderer and when I have discovered him—— Ah!” His eyes lit up.\r\nSuddenly he drew an immense knife from beneath his coat and brandished\r\nit aloft. “Not all at once will I kill him—oh, no!—first I will slit\r\nhis nose, and cut off his ears and put out his eyes, and then—then,\r\ninto his black heart I will thrust this knife.”\r\n\r\nSwiftly he replaced the knife, and turning, left the room. George\r\nLomax, his eyes always protuberant, but now goggling almost out of his\r\nhead, stared at the closed door.\r\n\r\n“Pure bred Herzoslovakian, of course,” he muttered. “Most uncivilized\r\npeople. A race of brigands.”\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Battle rose alertly to his feet.\r\n\r\n“Either that man’s sincere,” he remarked, “or he’s the best bluffer\r\nI’ve ever seen. And, if it’s the former, God help Prince Michael’s\r\nmurderer when that human bloodhound gets hold of him.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15\r\n\r\nThe French Stranger\r\n\r\n\r\nVirginia and Anthony walked side by side down the path which led to the\r\nlake. For some minutes after leaving the house they were silent. It was\r\nVirginia who broke the silence at last with a little laugh.\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear,” she said, “isn’t it dreadful? Here I am so bursting with\r\nthe things I want to tell you, and the things I want to know, that\r\nI simply don’t know where to begin. First of all”—she lowered her\r\nvoice—“_What have you done with the body?_ How awful it sounds,\r\ndoesn’t it! I never dreamt that I should be so steeped in crime.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose it’s quite a novel sensation for you,” agreed Anthony.\r\n\r\n“But not for you?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ve never disposed of a corpse before, certainly.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me about it.”\r\n\r\nBriefly and succinctly, Anthony ran over the steps he had taken on the\r\nprevious night. Virginia listened attentively.\r\n\r\n“I think you were very clever,” she said approvingly when he had\r\nfinished. “I can pick up the trunk again when I go back to Paddington.\r\nThe only difficulty that might arise is if you had to give an account\r\nof where you were yesterday evening.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t see that that can arise. The body can’t have been found until\r\nlate last night—or possibly this morning. Otherwise there would have\r\nbeen something about it in this morning’s papers. And whatever you may\r\nimagine from reading detective stories, doctors aren’t such magicians\r\nthat they can tell you exactly how many hours a man has been dead. The\r\nexact time of his death will be pretty vague. An alibi for last night\r\nwould be far more to the point.”\r\n\r\n“I know. Lord Caterham was telling me all about it. But the Scotland\r\nYard man is quite convinced of your innocence now, isn’t he?”\r\n\r\nAnthony did not reply at once.\r\n\r\n“He doesn’t look particularly astute,” continued Virginia.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know about that,” said Anthony slowly. “I’ve an impression\r\nthat there are no flies on Superintendent Battle. He appears to be\r\nconvinced of my innocence—but I’m not so sure. He’s stumped at present\r\nby my apparent lack of motive.”\r\n\r\n“Apparent?” cried Virginia. “But what possible reason could you have\r\nfor murdering an unknown foreign Count?”\r\n\r\nAnthony darted a sharp glance at her.\r\n\r\n“You were at one time or other in Herzoslovakia, weren’t you?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes. I was there with my husband, for two years, at the Embassy.”\r\n\r\n“That was just before the assassination of the King and Queen. Did you\r\never run across Prince Michael Obolovitch?”\r\n\r\n“Michael? Of course I did. Horrid little wretch! He suggested, I\r\nremember, that I should marry him morganatically.”\r\n\r\n“Did he really? And what did he suggest you should do about your\r\nexisting husband?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, he had a sort of David and Uriah scheme all made out.”\r\n\r\n“And how did you respond to this amiable offer?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Virginia, “unfortunately one had to be diplomatic. So poor\r\nlittle Michael didn’t get it as straight from the shoulder as he might\r\nhave done. But he retired hurt all the same. Why all this interest\r\nabout Michael?”\r\n\r\n“Something I’m getting at in my own blundering fashion. I take it that\r\nyou didn’t meet the murdered man?”\r\n\r\n“No. To put it like a book, he ‘retired to his own apartments\r\nimmediately on arrival.’”\r\n\r\n“And of course you haven’t seen the body?”\r\n\r\nVirginia, eyeing him with a good deal of interest, shook her head.\r\n\r\n“Could you get to see it, do you think?”\r\n\r\n“By means of influence in high places—meaning Lord Caterham—I dare\r\nsay I could. Why? Is it an order?”\r\n\r\n“Good Lord, no,” said Anthony, horrified. “Have I been as dictatorial\r\nas all that? No, it’s simply this. Count Stanislaus was the incognito\r\nof Prince Michael of Herzoslovakia.”\r\n\r\nVirginia’s eyes opened very wide.\r\n\r\n“I see.” Suddenly her face broke into its fascinating one-sided smile.\r\n“I hope you don’t suggest that Michael went to his rooms simply to\r\navoid seeing me?”\r\n\r\n“Something of the kind,” admitted Anthony. “You see, if I’m right in\r\nmy idea that some one wanted to prevent your coming to Chimneys, the\r\nreason seems to lie in your knowing Herzoslovakia. Do you realize that\r\nyou’re the only person here who knew Prince Michael by sight?”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean that this man who was murdered was an impostor?” asked\r\nVirginia abruptly.\r\n\r\n“That is the possibility that crossed my mind. If you can get Lord\r\nCaterham to show you the body, we can clear up that point at once.”\r\n\r\n“He was shot at 11.45,” said Virginia thoughtfully. “The time mentioned\r\non that scrap of paper. The whole thing’s horribly mysterious.”\r\n\r\n“That reminds me. Is that your window up there? The second from the end\r\nover the Council Chamber?”\r\n\r\n“No, my room is in the Elizabethan wing, the other side. Why?”\r\n\r\n“Simply because as I walked away last night, after thinking I heard a\r\nshot, the light went up in that room.”\r\n\r\n“How curious! I don’t know who has that room, but I can find out by\r\nasking Bundle. Perhaps they heard the shot?”\r\n\r\n“If so, they haven’t come forward to say so. I understood from Battle\r\nthat nobody in the house heard the shot fired. It’s the only clue of\r\nany kind that I’ve got, and I dare say it’s a pretty rotten one, but I\r\nmean to follow it up for what it’s worth.”\r\n\r\n“It’s curious, certainly,” said Virginia thoughtfully.\r\n\r\nThey had arrived at the boat-house by the lake, and had been leaning\r\nagainst it as they talked.\r\n\r\n“And now for the whole story,” said Anthony. “We’ll paddle gently about\r\non the lake, secure from the prying ears of Scotland Yard, American\r\nvisitors, and curious house-maids.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve heard something from Lord Caterham,” said Virginia. “But not\r\nnearly enough. To begin with, which are you really, Anthony Cade or\r\nJimmy McGrath?”\r\n\r\nFor the second time that morning, Anthony unfolded the history of the\r\nlast six weeks of his life—with this difference that the account given\r\nto Virginia needed no editing. He finished up with his own astonished\r\nrecognition of “Mr. Holmes.”\r\n\r\n“By the way, Mrs. Revel,” he ended, “I’ve never thanked you for\r\nimperilling your immortal soul by saying that I was an old friend of\r\nyours.”\r\n\r\n“Of course you’re an old friend,” cried Virginia. “You don’t suppose\r\nI’d cumber you with a corpse, and then pretend you were a mere\r\nacquaintance next time I met you? No, indeed!”\r\n\r\nShe paused.\r\n\r\n“Do you know one thing that strikes me about all this?” she went on.\r\n“That there’s some extra mystery about those Memoirs that we haven’t\r\nfathomed yet.”\r\n\r\n“I think you’re right,” agreed Anthony. “There’s one thing I’d like you\r\nto tell me,” he continued.\r\n\r\n“What’s that?”\r\n\r\n“Why did you seem so surprised when I mentioned the name of Jimmy\r\nMcGrath to you yesterday at Pont Street? Had you heard it before?”\r\n\r\n“I had, Sherlock Holmes. George—my cousin, George Lomax, you\r\nknow—came to see me the other day, and suggested a lot of frightfully\r\nsilly things. His idea was that I should come down here and make\r\nmyself agreeable to this man McGrath and Delilah the Memoirs out of\r\nhim somehow. He didn’t put it like that, of course. He talked a lot of\r\nnonsense about English gentlewomen, and things like that, but his real\r\nmeaning was never obscure for a moment. It was just the sort of rotten\r\nthing poor old George would think of. And then I wanted to know too\r\nmuch, and he tried to put me off with lies that wouldn’t have deceived\r\na child of two.”\r\n\r\n“Well, his plan seems to have succeeded, anyhow,” observed Anthony.\r\n“Here am I, the James McGrath he had in mind, and here are you being\r\nagreeable to me.”\r\n\r\n“But, alas, for poor old George, no Memoirs! Now I’ve got a question\r\nfor you. When I said I hadn’t written those letters, you said you knew\r\nI hadn’t—you couldn’t know any such thing?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, I could,” said Anthony, smiling. “I’ve got a good working\r\nknowledge of psychology.”\r\n\r\n“You mean your belief in the sterling worth of my moral character was\r\nsuch that——”\r\n\r\nBut Anthony was shaking his head vigorously.\r\n\r\n“Not at all. I don’t know anything about your moral character. You\r\nmight have a lover, and you might write to him. But you’d never lie\r\ndown to be blackmailed. The Virginia Revel of those letters was scared\r\nstiff. You’d have fought.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder who the real Virginia Revel is—where she is, I mean. It\r\nmakes me feel as though I had a double somewhere.”\r\n\r\nAnthony lit a cigarette.\r\n\r\n“You know that one of the letters was written from Chimneys?” he asked\r\nat last.\r\n\r\n“What?” Virginia was clearly startled. “When was it written?”\r\n\r\n“It wasn’t dated. But it’s odd, isn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“I’m perfectly certain no other Virginia Revel has ever stayed at\r\nChimneys. Bundle or Lord Caterham would have said something about the\r\ncoincidence of the name if she had.”\r\n\r\n“Yes. It’s rather queer. Do you know, Mrs. Revel, I am beginning to\r\ndisbelieve profoundly in this other Virginia Revel.”\r\n\r\n“She’s very elusive,” agreed Virginia.\r\n\r\n“Extraordinarily elusive. I am beginning to think that the person who\r\nwrote those letters deliberately used your name.”\r\n\r\n“But why?” cried Virginia. “Why should they do such a thing?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, that’s just the question. There’s the devil of a lot to find out\r\nabout everything.”\r\n\r\n“Who do you really think killed Michael?” asked Virginia suddenly. “The\r\nComrades of the Red Hand?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose they might have done so,” said Anthony in a dissatisfied\r\nvoice. “Pointless killing would be rather characteristic of them.”\r\n\r\n“Let’s get to work,” said Virginia. “I see Lord Caterham and Bundle\r\nstrolling together. The first thing to do is to find out definitely\r\nwhether the dead man is Michael or not.”\r\n\r\nAnthony paddled to shore and a few moments later they had joined Lord\r\nCaterham and his daughter.\r\n\r\n“Lunch is late,” said his lordship in a depressed voice. “Battle has\r\ninsulted the cook, I expect.”\r\n\r\n“This is a friend of mine, Bundle,” said Virginia. “Be nice to him.”\r\n\r\nBundle looked earnestly at Anthony for some minutes, and then addressed\r\na remark to Virginia as though he had not been there.\r\n\r\n“Where do you pick up these nice-looking men, Virginia? ‘How do you do\r\nit?’ says she enviously.”\r\n\r\n“You can have him,” said Virginia generously. “I want Lord Caterham.”\r\n\r\nShe smiled upon the flattered peer, slipped her hand through his arm\r\nand they moved off together.\r\n\r\n“Do you talk?” asked Bundle. “Or are you just strong and silent?”\r\n\r\n“Talk?” said Anthony. “I babble. I murmur. I gurgle—like the running\r\nbrook, you know. Sometimes I even ask questions.”\r\n\r\n“As for instance?”\r\n\r\n“Who occupies the second room on the left from the end?”\r\n\r\nHe pointed to it as he spoke.\r\n\r\n“What an extraordinary question!” said Bundle. “You intrigue me\r\ngreatly. Let me see—yes—that’s Mademoiselle Brun’s room. The French\r\ngoverness. She endeavours to keep my young sisters in order. Dulcie and\r\nDaisy—like the song, you know. I dare say they’d have called the next\r\none, Dorothy May. But mother got tired of having nothing but girls and\r\ndied. Thought some one else could take on the job of providing an heir.”\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle Brun,” said Anthony thoughtfully. “How long has she been\r\nwith you?”\r\n\r\n“Two months. She came to us when we were in Scotland.”\r\n\r\n“Ha!” said Anthony. “I smell a rat.”\r\n\r\n“I wish I could smell some lunch,” said Bundle. “Do I ask the Scotland\r\nYard man to have lunch with us, Mr. Cade? You’re a man of the world,\r\nyou know about the etiquette of such things. We’ve never had a murder\r\nin the house before. Exciting, isn’t it? I’m sorry your character\r\nwas so completely cleared this morning. I’ve always wanted to meet a\r\nmurderer and see for myself if they’re as genial and charming as the\r\nSunday papers always say they are. God! what’s that?”\r\n\r\n“What” seemed to be a taxi approaching the house. Its two occupants\r\nwere a tall man with a bald head and a black beard, and a smaller\r\nand younger man with a black moustache. Anthony recognized the\r\nformer, and guessed that it was he—rather than the vehicle which\r\ncontained him—that had wrung the exclamation of astonishment from his\r\ncompanion’s lips.\r\n\r\n“Unless I much mistake,” he remarked, “that is my old friend, Baron\r\nLollipop.”\r\n\r\n“Baron what?”\r\n\r\n“I call him Lollipop for convenience. The pronouncing of his own name\r\ntends to harden the arteries.”\r\n\r\n“It nearly wrecked the telephone this morning,” remarked Bundle. “So\r\nthat’s the Baron, is it? I foresee he’ll be turned on to me this\r\nafternoon—and I’ve had Isaacstein all the morning. Let George do his\r\nown dirty work, say I, and to hell with politics. Excuse me leaving\r\nyou, Mr. Cade, but I must stand by poor old Father.”\r\n\r\nBundle retreated rapidly to the house.\r\n\r\nAnthony stood looking after her for a minute or two and thoughtfully\r\nlighted a cigarette. As he did so, his ear was caught by a stealthy\r\nsound quite near him. He was standing by the boat-house, and the sound\r\nseemed to come from just round the corner. The mental picture conveyed\r\nto him was that of a man vainly trying to stifle a sudden sneeze.\r\n\r\n“Now I wonder—I very much wonder who’s behind the boat-house,” said\r\nAnthony to himself. “We’d better see, I think.”\r\n\r\nSuiting the action to the word, he threw away the match he had just\r\nblown out, and ran lightly and noiselessly round the corner of the\r\nboat-house.\r\n\r\nHe came upon a man who had evidently been kneeling on the ground and\r\nwas just struggling to rise to his feet. He was tall, wore a light\r\ncoloured overcoat and glasses, and for the rest, had a short pointed\r\nblack beard and a slightly foppish manner. He was between thirty and\r\nforty years of age, and altogether of a most respectable appearance.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing here?” asked Anthony.\r\n\r\nHe was pretty certain that the man was not one of Lord Caterham’s\r\nguests.\r\n\r\n“I ask your pardon,” said the stranger, with a marked foreign accent\r\nand what was meant to be an engaging smile. “It is that I wish to\r\nreturn to the _Jolly Crickets_, and I have lost my way. Would Monsieur\r\nbe so good as to direct me?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” said Anthony. “But you don’t go there by water, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Eh?” said the stranger, with the air of one at a loss.\r\n\r\n“I said,” repeated Anthony, with a meaning glance at the boat-house,\r\n“that you won’t get there by water. There’s a right of way across the\r\npark—some distance away, but all this is the private part. You’re\r\ntrespassing.”\r\n\r\n“I am most sorry,” said the stranger. “I lost my direction entirely. I\r\nthought I would come up here and inquire.”\r\n\r\nAnthony refrained from pointing out that kneeling behind a boat-house\r\nwas a somewhat peculiar manner of prosecuting inquiries. He took the\r\nstranger kindly by the arm.\r\n\r\n“You go this way,” he said. “Right round the lake and straight on—you\r\ncan’t miss the path. When you get on it, turn to the left, and it will\r\nlead you to the village. You’re staying at the _Cricketers_, I suppose?”\r\n\r\n“I am, monsieur. Since this morning. Many thanks for your kindness in\r\ndirecting me.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t mention it,” said Anthony. “I hope you haven’t caught cold.”\r\n\r\n“Eh?” said the stranger.\r\n\r\n“From kneeling on the damp ground, I mean,” explained Anthony. “I\r\nfancied I heard you sneezing.”\r\n\r\n“I may have sneezed,” admitted the other.\r\n\r\n“Quite so,” said Anthony. “But you shouldn’t suppress a sneeze, you\r\nknow. One of the most eminent doctors said so only the other day.\r\nIt’s frightfully dangerous. I don’t remember exactly what it does to\r\nyou—whether it’s an inhibition or whether it hardens your arteries,\r\nbut you must never do it. Good morning.”\r\n\r\n“Good morning, and thank you, monsieur, for setting me on the right\r\nroad.”\r\n\r\n“Second suspicious stranger from village inn,” murmured Anthony to\r\nhimself, as he watched the other’s retreating form. “And one that I\r\ncan’t quite place, either. Appearance that of a French commercial\r\ntraveller. I don’t quite see him as a Comrade of the Red Hand. Does he\r\nrepresent yet a third party in the harassed state of Herzoslovakia?\r\nThe French governess has the second window from the end. A mysterious\r\nFrenchman is found slinking round the grounds, listening to\r\nconversations that are not meant for his ears. I’ll bet my hat there’s\r\nsomething in it.”\r\n\r\nMusing thus, Anthony retraced his steps to the house. On the terrace\r\nhe encountered Lord Caterham, looking suitably depressed, and two new\r\narrivals. He brightened a little at the sight of Anthony.\r\n\r\n“Ah, there you are,” he remarked. “Let me introduce you to\r\nBaron—er—er—and Captain Andrassy. Mr. Anthony Cade.”\r\n\r\nThe Baron stared at Anthony with growing suspicion.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Cade?” he said stiffly. “I think not.”\r\n\r\n“A word alone with you, Baron,” said Anthony. “I can explain\r\neverything.”\r\n\r\nThe Baron bowed, and the two men walked down the terrace together.\r\n\r\n“Baron,” said Anthony. “I must throw myself upon your mercy. I have so\r\nfar strained the honour of an English gentleman as to travel to this\r\ncountry under an assumed name. I represented myself to you as Mr. James\r\nMcGrath—but you must see for yourself that the deception involved\r\nwas infinitesimal. You are doubtless acquainted with the works of\r\nShakespeare, and his remarks about the unimportance of the nomenclature\r\nof roses? This case is the same. The man you wanted to see was the man\r\nin possession of the Memoirs. I was that man. As you know only too\r\nwell, I am no longer in possession of them. A neat trick. Baron, a very\r\nneat trick. Who thought of it, you or your principal?”\r\n\r\n“His Highness’s own idea it was. And for anyone but him to carry it out\r\nhe would not permit.”\r\n\r\n“He did it jolly well,” said Anthony, with approval. “I never took him\r\nfor anything but an Englishman.”\r\n\r\n“The education of an English gentleman did the Prince receive,”\r\nexplained the Baron. “The custom of Herzoslovakia it is.”\r\n\r\n“No professional could have pinched those papers better,” said Anthony.\r\n“May I ask, without indiscretion, what has become of them?”\r\n\r\n“Between gentlemen,” began the Baron.\r\n\r\n“You are too kind, Baron,” murmured Anthony. “I’ve never been called a\r\ngentleman so often as I have in the last forty-eight hours.”\r\n\r\n“I to you say this—I believe them to be burnt.”\r\n\r\n“You believe, but you don’t know, eh? Is that it?”\r\n\r\n“His Highness in his own keeping retained them. His purpose it was to\r\nread them and then by the fire to destroy them.”\r\n\r\n“I see,” said Anthony. “All the same, they are not the kind of light\r\nliterature you’d skim through in half an hour.”\r\n\r\n“Among the effects of my martyred master they have not discovered been.\r\nIt is clear, therefore, that burnt they are.”\r\n\r\n“H’m!” said Anthony. “I wonder?”\r\n\r\nHe was silent for a minute or two and then went on.\r\n\r\n“I have asked you these questions, Baron, because, as you may have\r\nheard, I myself have been implicated in the crime. I must clear myself\r\nabsolutely, so that no suspicion attaches to me.”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly,” said the Baron. “Your honour demands it.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” said Anthony. “You put these things so well. I haven’t got\r\nthe knack of it. To continue, I can only clear myself by discovering\r\nthe real murderer, and to do that I must have all the facts. This\r\nquestion of the Memoirs is very important. It seems to me possible that\r\nto gain possession of them might be the motive of the crime. Tell me,\r\nBaron, is that a very far-fetched idea?”\r\n\r\nThe Baron hesitated for a moment or two.\r\n\r\n“You yourself the Memoirs have read?” he asked cautiously at length.\r\n\r\n“I think I am answered,” said Anthony, smiling. “Now Baron, there’s\r\njust one thing more. I should like to give you fair warning that it\r\nis still my intention to deliver that manuscript to the publishers on\r\nWednesday next, the 13th of October.”\r\n\r\nThe Baron stared at him.\r\n\r\n“But you have no longer got it?”\r\n\r\n“On Wednesday next, I said. To-day is Friday. That gives me five days\r\nto get hold of it again.”\r\n\r\n“But if it is burnt?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think it is burnt. I have good reasons for not believing so.”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke they turned the corner of the terrace. A massive figure was\r\nadvancing towards them. Anthony, who had not yet seen the great Mr.\r\nHerman Isaacstein, looked at him with considerable interest.\r\n\r\n“Ah, Baron,” said Isaacstein, waving the big black cigar he was\r\nsmoking, “this is a bad business—a very bad business.”\r\n\r\n“My good friend, Mr. Isaacstein, it is indeed,” cried the Baron. “All\r\nour noble edifice in ruins is.”\r\n\r\nAnthony tactfully left the two gentlemen to their lamentations, and\r\nretraced his steps along the terrace.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he came to a halt. A thin spiral of smoke was rising into the\r\nair apparently from the very centre of the yew hedge.\r\n\r\n“It must be hollow in the middle,” reflected Anthony. “I’ve heard of\r\nsuch things before.”\r\n\r\nHe looked swiftly to right and left of him. Lord Caterham was at the\r\nfarther end of the terrace with Captain Andrassy. Their backs were\r\ntowards him. Anthony bent down and wriggled his way through the massive\r\nyew.\r\n\r\nHe had been quite right in his supposition. The yew hedge was really\r\nnot one, but two, a narrow passage divided them. The entrance to this\r\nwas about half-way up, on the side of the house. There was no mystery\r\nabout it, but no one seeing the yew hedge from the front would have\r\nguessed at the probability.\r\n\r\nAnthony looked down the narrow vista. About half-way down, a man was\r\nreclining in a basket chair. A half-smoked cigar rested on the arm of\r\nthe chair, and the gentleman himself appeared to be asleep.\r\n\r\n“H’m!” said Anthony to himself. “Evidently Mr. Hiram Fish prefers\r\nsitting in the shade.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16\r\n\r\nTea in the Schoolroom\r\n\r\n\r\nAnthony regained the terrace with the feeling uppermost in his mind\r\nthat the only safe place for private conversations was the middle of\r\nthe lake.\r\n\r\nThe resonant boom of a gong sounded from the house, and Tredwell\r\nappeared in a stately fashion from a side door.\r\n\r\n“Luncheon is served, my lord.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Lord Caterham, brisking up a little. “Lunch.”\r\n\r\nAt that moment two children burst out of the house. They were\r\nhigh-spirited young women of twelve and ten, and though their names\r\nmight be Dulcie and Daisy, as Bundle had affirmed, they appeared to be\r\nmore generally known as Guggle and Winkle. They executed a kind of war\r\ndance, interspersed with shrill whoops till Bundle emerged and quelled\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“Where’s Mademoiselle?” she demanded.\r\n\r\n“She’s got the _migraine_, the _migraine_, the _migraine_!” chanted\r\nWinkle.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah!” said Guggle, joining in.\r\n\r\nLord Caterham had succeeded in shepherding most of his guests into the\r\nhouse. Now he laid a restraining hand on Anthony’s arm.\r\n\r\n“Come to my study,” he breathed. “I’ve got something rather special\r\nthere.”\r\n\r\nSlinking down the hall, far more like a thief than like the master of\r\nthe house, Lord Caterham gained the shelter of his sanctum. Here he\r\nunlocked a cupboard and produced various bottles.\r\n\r\n“Talking to foreigners always makes me so thirsty,” he explained\r\napologetically. “I don’t know why it is.”\r\n\r\nThere was a knock on the door, and Virginia popped her head round the\r\ncorner of it.\r\n\r\n“Got a special cocktail for me?” she demanded.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said Lord Caterham hospitably. “Come in.”\r\n\r\nThe next few minutes were taken up with serious rites.\r\n\r\n“I needed that,” said Lord Caterham with a sigh, as he replaced his\r\nglass on the table. “As I said just now, I find talking to foreigners\r\nparticularly fatiguing. I think it’s because they’re so polite. Come\r\nalong. Let’s have some lunch.”\r\n\r\nHe led the way to the dining-room. Virginia put her hand on Anthony’s\r\narm, and drew him back a little.\r\n\r\n“I’ve done my good deed for the day,” she whispered. “I got Lord\r\nCaterham to take me to see the body.”\r\n\r\n“Well?” demanded Anthony eagerly.\r\n\r\nOne theory of his was to be proved or disproved.\r\n\r\nVirginia was shaking her head.\r\n\r\n“You were wrong,” she whispered. “It’s Prince Michael all right.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” Anthony was deeply chagrined.\r\n\r\n“And Mademoiselle has the _migraine_,” he added aloud, in a\r\ndissatisfied tone.\r\n\r\n“What has that got to do with it?”\r\n\r\n“Probably nothing, but I wanted to see her. You see, I’ve found out\r\nthat Mademoiselle has the second room from the end—the one where I saw\r\nthe light last night.”\r\n\r\n“That’s interesting.”\r\n\r\n“Probably there’s nothing in it. All the same, I mean to see\r\nMademoiselle before the day is out.”\r\n\r\nLunch was somewhat of an ordeal. Even the cheerful impartiality of\r\nBundle failed to reconcile the heterogeneous assembly. The Baron and\r\nAndrassy were correct, formal, full of etiquette, and had the air of\r\nattending a meal in a mausoleum. Lord Caterham was lethargic and\r\ndepressed. Bill Eversleigh stared longingly at Virginia. George, very\r\nmindful of the trying position in which he found himself, conversed\r\nweightily with the Baron and Mr. Isaacstein. Guggle and Winkle,\r\ncompletely beside themselves with joy of having a murder in the house,\r\nhad to be continually checked and kept under, whilst Mr. Hiram Fish\r\nslowly masticated his food, and drawled out dry remarks in his own\r\npeculiar idiom. Superintendent Battle had considerately vanished, and\r\nnobody knew what had become of him.\r\n\r\n“Thank God that’s over,” murmured Bundle to Anthony, as they left the\r\ntable. “And George is taking the foreign contingent over to the Abbey\r\nthis afternoon to discuss State secrets.”\r\n\r\n“That will possibly relieve the atmosphere,” agreed Anthony.\r\n\r\n“I don’t mind the American so much,” continued Bundle. “He and Father\r\ncan talk first editions together quite happily in some secluded spot.\r\nMr. Fish”—as the object of their conversation drew near—“I’m planning\r\na peaceful afternoon for you.”\r\n\r\nThe American bowed.\r\n\r\n“That’s too kind of you, Lady Eileen.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Fish,” said Anthony, “had quite a peaceful morning.”\r\n\r\nMr. Fish shot a quick glance at him.\r\n\r\n“Ah, sir, you observed me, then, in my seclooded retreat? There are\r\nmoments, sir, when far from the madding crowd is the only motto for a\r\nman of quiet tastes.”\r\n\r\nBundle had drifted on, and the American and Anthony were left together.\r\nThe former dropped his voice a little.\r\n\r\n“I opine,” he said, “that there is considerable mystery about this\r\nlittle dust up?”\r\n\r\n“Any amount of it,” said Anthony.\r\n\r\n“That guy with the bald head was perhaps a family connection?”\r\n\r\n“Something of the kind.”\r\n\r\n“These Central European nations beat the band,” declared Mr. Fish.\r\n“It’s kind of being rumoured around that the deceased gentleman was a\r\nRoyal Highness. Is that so, do you know?”\r\n\r\n“He was staying here as Count Stanislaus,” replied Anthony evasively.\r\n\r\nTo this Mr. Fish offered no further rejoinder than the somewhat cryptic:\r\n\r\n“Oh! boy.”\r\n\r\nAfter which he relapsed into silence for some moments.\r\n\r\n“This police captain of yours,” he observed at last, “Battle, or\r\nwhatever his name is, is he the goods all right?”\r\n\r\n“Scotland Yard thinks so,” replied Anthony dryly.\r\n\r\n“He seems kind of hide-bound to me,” remarked Mr. Fish. “No hustle to\r\nhim. This big idea of his, letting no one leave the house, what is\r\nthere to it?”\r\n\r\nHe darted a very sharp look at Anthony as he spoke.\r\n\r\n“Everyone’s got to attend the inquest to-morrow morning, you see.”\r\n\r\n“That’s the idea, is it? No more to it than that? No question of Lord\r\nCaterham’s guests being suspected?”\r\n\r\n“My dear Mr. Fish!”\r\n\r\n“I was getting a mite uneasy—being a stranger in this country. But of\r\ncourse it was an outside job—I remember now. Window found unfastened,\r\nwasn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“It was,” said Anthony, looking straight in front of him.\r\n\r\nMr. Fish sighed. After a minute or two he said in a plaintive tone:\r\n\r\n“Young man, do you know how they get the water out of a mine?”\r\n\r\n“How?”\r\n\r\n“By pumping—but its almighty hard work! I observe the figure of my\r\ngenial host detaching itself from the group over yonder. I must join\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nMr. Fish walked gently away, and Bundle drifted back again.\r\n\r\n“Funny Fish, isn’t he?” she remarked.\r\n\r\n“He is.”\r\n\r\n“It’s no good looking at Virginia,” said Bundle sharply.\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t.”\r\n\r\n“You were. I don’t know how she does it. It isn’t what she says, I\r\ndon’t even believe it’s what she looks. But, oh, boy! she gets there\r\nevery time. Anyway, she’s on duty elsewhere for the time. She told\r\nme to be nice to you, and I’m going to be nice to you—by force if\r\nnecessary.”\r\n\r\n“No force required,” Anthony assured her. “But, if it’s all the same to\r\nyou, I’d rather you were nice to me on the water, in a boat.”\r\n\r\n“It’s not a bad idea,” said Bundle meditatively.\r\n\r\nThey strolled down to the lake together.\r\n\r\n“There’s just one question I’d like to ask you,” said Anthony as\r\nhe paddled gently out from the shore, “before we turn to really\r\ninteresting topics. Business before pleasure.”\r\n\r\n“Whose bedroom do you want to know about now?” asked Bundle with weary\r\npatience.\r\n\r\n“Nobody’s bedroom for the moment. But I would like to know where you\r\ngot your French governess from.”\r\n\r\n“The man’s bewitched,” said Bundle. “I got her from an Agency, and I\r\npay her a hundred pounds a year, and her Christian name is Genevieve.\r\nAnything more you want to know?”\r\n\r\n“We’ll assume the Agency,” said Anthony. “What about her references?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, glowing! She’d lived for ten years with the Countess of What Not.”\r\n\r\n“What Not being——?”\r\n\r\n“The Comtesses de Breteuil, Chateau de Breteuil, Dinard.”\r\n\r\n“You didn’t actually see the Comtesse yourself? It was all done by\r\nletter?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly.”\r\n\r\n“H’m!” said Anthony.\r\n\r\n“You intrigue me,” said Bundle. “You intrigue me enormously. Is it love\r\nor crime?”\r\n\r\n“Probably sheer idiocy on my part. Let’s forget it.”\r\n\r\n“‘Let’s forget it,’ said he negligently, having extracted all the\r\ninformation he wants. Mr. Cade, who do you suspect? I rather suspect\r\nVirginia as being the most unlikely person. Or possibly Bill.”\r\n\r\n“What about you?”\r\n\r\n“Member of the aristocracy joins in secret the Comrades of the Red\r\nHand. It would create a sensation all right.”\r\n\r\nAnthony laughed. He liked Bundle, though he was a little afraid of the\r\nshrewd penetration of her sharp grey eyes.\r\n\r\n“You must be proud of all this,” he said suddenly, waving his hand\r\ntowards the great house in the distance.\r\n\r\nBundle screwed up her eyes and tilted her head on one side.\r\n\r\n“Yes—it means something, I suppose. But one’s too used to it. Anyway,\r\nwe’re not here very much—too deadly dull. We’ve been at Cowes and\r\nDeauville all the summer after town, and then up to Scotland. Chimneys\r\nhas been swathed in dust sheets for about five months. Once a week\r\nthey take the dust sheets off and chars-à-bancs full of tourists come\r\nand gape, and listen to Tredwell. ‘On your right is the portrait of\r\nthe fourth Marchioness of Caterham, painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds,’\r\netc., and Ed or Bert, the humorist of the party, nudges his girl and\r\nsays ‘Eh! Gladys, they’ve got two pennyworth of pictures here, right\r\nenough.’ And then they go and look at more pictures and yawn and\r\nshuffle their feet and wish it was time to go home.”\r\n\r\n“Yet history has been made here once or twice, by all accounts.”\r\n\r\n“You’ve been listening to George,” said Bundle sharply. “That’s the\r\nkind of thing he’s always saying.”\r\n\r\nBut Anthony had raised himself on his elbow, and was staring at the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\n“Is that a third suspicious stranger I see standing disconsolately by\r\nthe boat-house? Or is it one of the house party?”\r\n\r\nBundle lifted her head from the scarlet cushion.\r\n\r\n“It’s Bill,” she said.\r\n\r\n“He seems to be looking for something.”\r\n\r\n“He’s probably looking for me,” said Bundle, without enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n“Shall we row quickly in the opposite direction?”\r\n\r\n“That’s quite the right answer, but it should be delivered with more\r\nenthusiasm.”\r\n\r\n“I shall row with double vigour after that rebuke.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” said Bundle. “I have my pride. Row me to where that young\r\nass is waiting. Somebody’s got to look after him, I suppose. Virginia\r\nmust have given him the slip. One of these days, inconceivable as it\r\nseems, I might want to marry George, so I might as well practise being\r\n‘one of our well known political hostesses.’”\r\n\r\nAnthony pulled obediently towards the shore.\r\n\r\n“And what’s to become of me, I should like to know?” he complained.\r\n“I refuse to be the unwanted third. Is that the children I see in the\r\ndistance?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Be careful, or they’ll rope you in.”\r\n\r\n“I’m rather fond of children,” said Anthony. “I might teach them some\r\nnice quiet intellectual game.”\r\n\r\n“Well, don’t say I didn’t warn you.”\r\n\r\nHaving relinquished Bundle to the care of her gallant captain, Anthony\r\nstrolled off to where various shrill cries disturbed the peace of the\r\nafternoon. He was received with acclamation.\r\n\r\n“Are you any good at playing Red Indians?” asked Guggle sternly.\r\n\r\n“Rather,” said Anthony. “You should hear the noise I make when I’m\r\nbeing scalped. Like this.” He illustrated.\r\n\r\n“Not so bad,” said Winkle grudgingly. “Now do the scalper’s yell.”\r\n\r\nAnthony obliged with a blood-curdling noise. In another minute the game\r\nof Red Indians was in full swing.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour later, Anthony wiped his forehead, and ventured to\r\ninquire after Mademoiselle’s _migraine_. He was pleased to hear that\r\nthat lady had entirely recovered. So popular had he become that he was\r\nurgently invited to come and have tea in the schoolroom.\r\n\r\n“And then you can tell us about the man you saw hung,” urged Guggle.\r\n\r\n“Did you say you’d got a bit of the rope with you?” asked Winkle.\r\n\r\n“It’s in my suit-case,” said Anthony solemnly. “You shall each have a\r\npiece of it.”\r\n\r\nWinkle immediately let out a Wild Indian yell of satisfaction.\r\n\r\n“We’ll have to go and get washed, I suppose,” said Guggle gloomily.\r\n“You will come to tea, won’t you? You won’t forget?”\r\n\r\nAnthony swore solemnly that nothing should prevent his keeping the\r\nengagement. Satisfied, the youthful pair beat a retreat towards the\r\nhouse. Anthony stood for a minute looking after them, and, as he did\r\nso, he became aware of a man leaving the other side of a little copse\r\nof trees and hurrying away across the park. He felt almost sure that it\r\nwas the same black-bearded stranger he had encountered that morning.\r\nWhilst he was hesitating whether to go after him or not the trees just\r\nahead of him were parted and Mr. Hiram Fish stepped out into the open.\r\nHe stared slightly when he saw Anthony.\r\n\r\n“A peaceful afternoon, Mr. Fish?” inquired the latter.\r\n\r\n“I thank you, yes.”\r\n\r\nMr. Fish did not look as peaceful as usual, however. His face was\r\nflushed, and he was breathing hard as though he had been running. He\r\ndrew out his watch and consulted it.\r\n\r\n“I guess,” he said softly, “it’s just about time for your British\r\ninstitution of afternoon tea.”\r\n\r\nClosing his watch with a snap, Mr. Fish ambled gently away in the\r\ndirection of the house.\r\n\r\nAnthony stood in a brown study and awoke with a start to the fact that\r\nSuperintendent Battle was standing beside him. Not the faintest sound\r\nhad heralded his approach, and he seemed literally to have materialized\r\nfrom space.\r\n\r\n“Where did you spring from?” asked Anthony irritably.\r\n\r\nWith a slight jerk of his head, Battle indicated the little copse of\r\ntrees behind them.\r\n\r\n“It seems a popular spot this afternoon,” remarked Anthony.\r\n\r\n“You were very lost in thought, Mr. Cade?”\r\n\r\n“I was indeed. Do you know what I was doing, Battle? I was trying to\r\nput two and one and five and three together so as to make four. And it\r\ncan’t be done, Battle, it simply can’t be done.”\r\n\r\n“There’s difficulties that way,” agreed the detective.\r\n\r\n“But you’re just the man I wanted to see. Battle, I want to go away.\r\nCan it be done?”\r\n\r\nTrue to his creed, Superintendent Battle showed neither emotion nor\r\nsurprise. His reply was easy and matter of fact.\r\n\r\n“That depends, sir, as to where you want to go.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you exactly, Battle. I’ll lay my cards upon the table.\r\nI want to go to Dinard, to the Chateau of Madame la Comtesse de\r\nBreteuil. Can it be done?”\r\n\r\n“When do you want to go, Mr. Cade?”\r\n\r\n“Say to-morrow after the inquest. I could be back here by Sunday\r\nevening.”\r\n\r\n“I see,” said the superintendent, with peculiar solidity.\r\n\r\n“Well, what about it?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve no objection, provided you go where you say you’re going, and\r\ncome straight back here.”\r\n\r\n“You’re a man in a thousand, Battle. Either you have taken an\r\nextraordinary fancy to me or else you’re extraordinarily deep. Which is\r\nit?”\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Battle smiled a little, but did not answer.\r\n\r\n“Well, well,” said Anthony, “I expect you’ll take your precautions.\r\nDiscreet minions of the law will follow my suspicious footsteps. So be\r\nit. But I do wish I knew what it was all about.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t get you, Mr. Cade.”\r\n\r\n“The Memoirs—what all the fuss is about. Were they only Memoirs? Or\r\nhave you got something up your sleeve?”\r\n\r\nBattle smiled again.\r\n\r\n“Take it like this. I’m doing you a favour because you’ve made a\r\nfavourable impression on me, Mr. Cade. I’d like you to work in with\r\nme over this case. The amateur and the professional, they go well\r\ntogether. The one has the intimacy, so to speak, and the other the\r\nexperience.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Anthony slowly, “I don’t mind admitting that I’ve always\r\nwanted to try my hand at unravelling a murder mystery.”\r\n\r\n“Any ideas about the case at all, Mr. Cade?”\r\n\r\n“Plenty of them,” said Anthony. “But they’re mostly questions.”\r\n\r\n“As, for instance?”\r\n\r\n“Who steps into the murdered Michael’s shoes? It seems to me that that\r\nis important?”\r\n\r\nA rather wry smile came over Superintendent Battle’s face.\r\n\r\n“I wondered if you’d think of that, sir. Prince Nicolas Obolovitch is\r\nthe next heir—first cousin of this gentleman.”\r\n\r\n“And where is he at the present moment?” asked Anthony, turning away\r\nto light a cigarette. “Don’t tell me you don’t know, Battle, because I\r\nshan’t believe you.”\r\n\r\n“We’ve reason to believe that he’s in the United States. He was until\r\nquite lately, at all events. Raising money on his expectations.”\r\n\r\nAnthony gave vent to a surprised whistle.\r\n\r\n“I get you,” said Anthony. “Michael was backed by England, Nicholas\r\nby America. In both countries a group of financiers are anxious to\r\nobtain the oil concessions. The Loyalist party adopted Michael as their\r\ncandidate—now they’ll have to look elsewhere. Gnashing of teeth on the\r\npart of Isaacstein and Co. and Mr. George Lomax. Rejoicings in Wall\r\nStreet. Am I right?”\r\n\r\n“You’re not far off,” said Superintendent Battle.\r\n\r\n“H’m!” said Anthony. “I almost dare swear that I know what you were\r\ndoing in that copse.”\r\n\r\nThe detective smiled, but made no reply.\r\n\r\n“International politics are very fascinating,” said Anthony, “but I\r\nfear I must leave you. I have an appointment in the schoolroom.”\r\n\r\nHe strode briskly away towards the house. Inquiries of the dignified\r\nTredwell showed him the way to the schoolroom. He tapped on the door\r\nand entered, to be greeted by squeals of joy.\r\n\r\nGuggle and Winkle immediately rushed at him and bore him in triumph to\r\nbe introduced to Mademoiselle.\r\n\r\nFor the first time, Anthony felt a qualm. Mademoiselle Brun was a\r\nsmall, middle-aged woman with a sallow face, pepper and salt hair, and\r\na budding moustache!\r\n\r\nAs the notorious foreign adventuress she did not fit into the picture\r\nat all.\r\n\r\n“I believe,” said Anthony to himself, “I’m making the most utter fool\r\nof myself. Never mind, I must go through with it now.”\r\n\r\nHe was extremely pleasant to Mademoiselle, and she, on her part,\r\nwas evidently delighted to have a good-looking young man invade her\r\nschoolroom. The meal was a great success.\r\n\r\nBut that evening, alone in the charming bedchamber that had been\r\nallotted to him, Anthony shook his head several times.\r\n\r\n“I’m wrong,” he said to himself. “For the second time, I’m wrong.\r\nSomehow or other, I can’t get the hang of this thing.”\r\n\r\nHe stopped in his pacing of the floor.\r\n\r\n“What the devil——” began Anthony.\r\n\r\nThe door was being softly opened. In another minute a man had slipped\r\ninto the room, and stood deferentially by the door.\r\n\r\nHe was a big fair man, squarely built, with high Slavonic cheek-bones,\r\nand dreamy fanatic eyes.\r\n\r\n“Who the devil are you?” asked Anthony, staring at him.\r\n\r\nThe man replied in perfect English.\r\n\r\n“I am Boris Anchoukoff.”\r\n\r\n“Prince Michael’s servant, eh?”\r\n\r\n“That is so. I served my master. He is dead. Now I serve you.”\r\n\r\n“It’s very kind of you,” said Anthony. “But I don’t happen to want a\r\nvalet.”\r\n\r\n“You are my master now. I will serve you faithfully.”\r\n\r\n“Yes—but—look here—I don’t need a valet. I can’t afford one.”\r\n\r\nBoris Anchoukoff looked at him with a touch of scorn.\r\n\r\n“I do not ask for money. I served my master. So will I serve you—to\r\nthe death!”\r\n\r\nStepping quickly forward, he dropped on one knee, caught Anthony’s hand\r\nand placed it on his forehead. Then he rose swiftly and left the room\r\nas suddenly as he had come.\r\n\r\nAnthony stared after him, his face a picture of astonishment.\r\n\r\n“That’s damned odd,” he said to himself. “A faithful sort of dog.\r\nCurious the instincts these fellows have.”\r\n\r\nHe rose and paced up and down.\r\n\r\n“All the same,” he muttered, “it’s awkward—damned awkward—just at\r\npresent.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n17\r\n\r\nA Midnight Adventure\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inquest took place on the following morning. It was extraordinarily\r\nunlike the inquests as pictured in sensational fiction. It satisfied\r\neven George Lomax in its rigid suppression of all interesting details.\r\nSuperintendent Battle and the Coroner, working together with the\r\nsupport of the Chief Constable, had reduced the proceedings to the\r\nlowest level of boredom.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the inquest, Anthony took an unostentatious departure.\r\n\r\nHis departure was the one bright spot in the day for Bill Eversleigh.\r\nGeorge Lomax, obsessed with the fear that something damaging to his\r\nDepartment might leak out, had been exceedingly trying. Miss Oscar and\r\nBill had been in constant attendance. Everything useful and interesting\r\nhad been done by Miss Oscar. Bill’s part had been to run to and fro\r\nwith countless messages, to decode telegrams, and to listen by the hour\r\nto George repeating himself.\r\n\r\nIt was a completely exhausted young man who retired to bed on Saturday\r\nnight. He had had practically no chance to talk to Virginia all\r\nday, owing to George’s exactions, and he felt injured and ill-used.\r\nThank goodness, that Colonial fellow had taken himself off. He had\r\nmonopolized far too much of Virginia’s society anyway. And of course\r\nif George Lomax went on making an ass of himself like this—— His\r\nmind seething with resentment, Bill fell asleep. And, in dreams, came\r\nconsolation. For he dreamt of Virginia.\r\n\r\nIt was an heroic dream, a dream of burning timbers in which he played\r\nthe part of the gallant rescuer. He brought down Virginia from the\r\ntopmost story in his arms. She was unconscious. He laid her on the\r\ngrass. Then he went off to find a packet of sandwiches. It was most\r\nimportant that he should find that packet of sandwiches. George had it,\r\nbut instead of giving it up to Bill, he began to dictate telegrams.\r\nThey were now in the vestry of a church, and any minute Virginia might\r\narrive to be married to him. Horror! He was wearing pyjamas. He must\r\nget home at once and find his proper clothes. He rushed out to the\r\ncar. The car would not start. No petrol in the tank! He was getting\r\ndesperate. And then a big General ’bus drew up and Virginia got out\r\nof it on the arm of the bald headed Baron. She was deliciously cool,\r\nand exquisitely dressed in grey. She came over to him and shook him by\r\nthe shoulders playfully. “Bill,” she said. “Oh, Bill.” She shook him\r\nharder. “Bill,” she said. “Wake up. Oh, do wake up!”\r\n\r\nVery dazed, Bill woke up. He was in his bedroom at Chimneys. But part\r\nof the dream was with him still. Virginia was leaning over him, and was\r\nrepeating the same words with variations.\r\n\r\n“Wake up, Bill. Oh, do wake up. Bill.”\r\n\r\n“Hullo!” said Bill, sitting up in bed. “What’s the matter?”\r\n\r\nVirginia gave a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n“Thank goodness. I thought you’d never wake up. I’ve been shaking you\r\nand shaking you. Are you properly awake now?”\r\n\r\n“I think so,” said Bill doubtfully.\r\n\r\n“You great lump,” said Virginia. “The trouble I’ve had! My arms are\r\naching.”\r\n\r\n“These insults are uncalled for,” said Bill, with dignity. “Let me say,\r\nVirginia, that I consider your conduct most unbecoming. Not at all that\r\nof a pure young widow.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be an idiot, Bill. Things are happening.”\r\n\r\n“What kind of things?”\r\n\r\n“Queer things. In the Council Chamber. I thought I heard a door bang\r\nsomewhere, and I came down to see. And then saw a light in the Council\r\nChamber. I crept along the passage, and peeped through the crack of the\r\ndoor. I couldn’t see much, but what I could see was so extraordinary\r\nthat I felt I must see more. And then, all of a sudden, I felt that I\r\nshould like a nice, big, strong man with me. And you were the nicest\r\nand biggest and strongest man I could think of, so I came in and tried\r\nto wake you up quietly. But I’ve been ages doing it.”\r\n\r\n“I see,” said Bill. “And what do you want me to do now? Get up and\r\ntackle the burglars?”\r\n\r\nVirginia wrinkled her brows.\r\n\r\n“I’m not sure that they are burglars. Bill, it’s very queer—— But\r\ndon’t let’s waste time talking. Get up.”\r\n\r\nBill slipped obediently out of bed.\r\n\r\n“Wait while I don a pair of boots—the big ones with nails in them.\r\nHowever big and strong I am, I’m not going to tackle hardened criminals\r\nwith bare feet.”\r\n\r\n“I like your pyjamas, Bill,” said Virginia dreamily. “Brightness\r\nwithout vulgarity.”\r\n\r\n“While we’re on the subject,” remarked Bill, reaching for his second\r\nboot, “I like that thingummybob of yours. It’s a pretty shade of green.\r\nWhat do you call it? It’s not just a dressing-gown, is it?”\r\n\r\n“It’s a _négligé_” said Virginia. “I’m glad you’ve led such a pure\r\nlife, Bill.”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t,” said Bill indignantly.\r\n\r\n“You’ve just betrayed the fact. You’re very nice, Bill, and I like you.\r\nI dare say that to-morrow morning—say about ten o’clock, a good safe\r\nhour for not unduly exciting the emotions—I might even kiss you.”\r\n\r\n“I always think these things are best carried out on the spur of the\r\nmoment,” suggested Bill.\r\n\r\n“We’ve other fish to fry,” said Virginia. “If you don’t want to put on\r\na gas mask and a shirt of chain mail, shall we start?”\r\n\r\n“I’m ready,” said Bill.\r\n\r\nHe wriggled into a lurid silk dressing-gown, and picked up a poker.\r\n\r\n“The orthodox weapon,” he observed.\r\n\r\n“Come on,” said Virginia, “and don’t make a noise.”\r\n\r\nThey crept out of the room and along the corridor, and then down the\r\nwide double staircase. Virginia frowned as they reached the bottom of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“Those boots of yours aren’t exactly domes of silence, are they, Bill?”\r\n\r\n“Nails will be nails,” said Bill. “I’m doing my best.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll have to take them off,” said Virginia firmly.\r\n\r\nBill groaned.\r\n\r\n“You can carry them in your hand. I want to see if you can make out\r\nwhat’s going on in the Council Chamber. Bill, it’s awfully mysterious.\r\nWhy should burglars take a man in armour to pieces?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I suppose they can’t take him away whole very well. They\r\ndisarticulate him, and pack him neatly.”\r\n\r\nVirginia shook her head, dissatisfied.\r\n\r\n“What should they want to steal a mouldy old suit of armour for? Why,\r\nChimneys is full of treasures that are much easier to take away.”\r\n\r\nBill shook his head.\r\n\r\n“How many of them are there?” he asked, taking a firmer grip of his\r\npoker.\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t see properly. You know what a keyhole is. And they only had\r\na flashlight.”\r\n\r\n“I expect they’ve gone by now,” said Bill hopefully.\r\n\r\nHe sat down on the bottom stair and drew off his boots. Then, holding\r\nthem in his hand, he crept along the passage that led to the Council\r\nChamber, Virginia close behind him. They halted outside the massive oak\r\ndoor. All was silent within, but suddenly Virginia pressed his arm, and\r\nhe nodded. A bright light had shown for a minute through the keyhole.\r\n\r\nBill went down on his knees, and applied his eye to the orifice. What\r\nhe saw was confusing in the extreme. The scene of the drama that was\r\nbeing enacted inside was evidently just to the left, out of his line\r\nof vision. A subdued chink every now and then seemed to point to the\r\nfact that the invaders were still dealing with the figure in armour.\r\nThere were two of these, Bill remembered. They stood together by the\r\nwall just under the Holbein portrait. The light of the electric torch\r\nwas evidently being directed upon the operations in progress. It\r\nleft the rest of the room nearly in darkness. Once a figure flitted\r\nacross Bill’s line of vision, but there was not sufficient light to\r\ndistinguish anything about it. It might have been that of a man or a\r\nwoman. In a minute or two it flitted back again and then the subdued\r\nchinking sounded again. Presently there came a new sound, a faint\r\ntap-tap as of knuckles on wood.\r\n\r\nBill sat back on his heels suddenly.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” whispered Virginia.\r\n\r\n“Nothing. It’s no good going on like this. We can’t see anything, and\r\nwe can’t guess what they’re up to. I must go in and tackle them.”\r\n\r\nHe drew on his boots and stood up.\r\n\r\n“Now, Virginia, listen to me. We’ll open the door as softly as\r\npossible. You know where the switch of the electric light is?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, just by the door.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think there are more than two of them. There may be only one.\r\nI want to get well into the room. Then, when I say ‘Go’ I want you to\r\nswitch on the lights. Do you understand?”\r\n\r\n“Perfectly.”\r\n\r\n“And don’t scream or faint or anything. I won’t let anyone hurt you.”\r\n\r\n“My hero!” murmured Virginia.\r\n\r\nBill peered at her suspiciously through the darkness. He heard a faint\r\nsound which might have been either a sob or a laugh. Then he grasped\r\nthe poker firmly and rose to his feet. He felt that he was fully alive\r\nto the situation.\r\n\r\nVery softly he turned the handle of the door. It yielded and swung\r\ngently inwards. Bill felt Virginia close beside him. Together they\r\nmoved noiselessly into the room.\r\n\r\nAt the farther end of the room, the torch was playing upon the Holbein\r\npicture. Silhouetted against it was the figure of a man, standing on a\r\nchair and gently tapping on the panelling! His back, of course, was to\r\nthem, and he merely loomed up as a monstrous shadow.\r\n\r\nWhat more they might have seen cannot be told, for at that moment\r\nBill’s nails squeaked upon the parquet floor. The man swung round,\r\ndirecting the powerful torch full upon them and almost dazzling them\r\nwith the sudden glare.\r\n\r\nBill did not hesitate.\r\n\r\n“Go,” he roared to Virginia, and sprang for his man, as she obediently\r\npressed down the switch of the electric lights.\r\n\r\nThe big chandelier should have been flooded with light; but, instead,\r\nall that happened was the click of the switch. The room remained in\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nVirginia heard Bill curse freely. The next minute the air was filled\r\nwith panting, scuffling sounds. The torch had fallen to the ground and\r\nextinguished itself in the fall. There was the sound of a desperate\r\nstruggle going on in the darkness, but as to who was getting the better\r\nof it, and indeed as to who was taking part in it, Virginia had no\r\nidea. Had there been anyone else in the room besides the man who was\r\ntapping the panelling? There might have been. Their glimpse had been\r\nonly a momentary one.\r\n\r\nVirginia felt paralysed. She hardly knew what to do. She dared not try\r\nand join in the struggle. To do so might hamper and not aid Bill. Her\r\none idea was to stay in the doorway, so that anyone trying to escape\r\nshould not leave the room that way. At the same time, she disobeyed\r\nBill’s express instructions and screamed loudly and repeatedly for help.\r\n\r\nShe heard doors opening upstairs, and a sudden gleam of light from the\r\nhall and the big staircase. If only Bill could hold his man until help\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nBut at that minute there was a final terrific upheaval. They must have\r\ncrashed into one of the figures in armour, for it fell to the ground\r\nwith a deafening noise. Virginia saw dimly a figure springing for the\r\nwindow, and at the same time heard Bill cursing and disengaging himself\r\nfrom fragments of armour.\r\n\r\nFor the first time, she left her post, and rushed wildly for the figure\r\nat the window. But the window was already unlatched. The intruder had\r\nno need to stop and fumble for it. He sprang out and raced away down\r\nthe terrace and round the corner of the house. Virginia raced after\r\nhim. She was young and athletic, and she turned the corner of the\r\nterrace not many seconds after her quarry.\r\n\r\nBut there she ran headlong into the arms of a man who was emerging from\r\na small side door. It was Mr. Hiram P. Fish.\r\n\r\n“Gee! It’s a lady,” he exclaimed. “Why, I beg your pardon, Mrs. Revel.\r\nI took you for one of the thugs fleeing from justice.”\r\n\r\n“He’s just passed this way,” cried Virginia breathlessly. “Can’t we\r\ncatch him?”\r\n\r\nBut, even as she spoke, she knew it was too late. The man must have\r\ngained the park by now, and it was a dark night with no moon. She\r\nretraced her steps to the Council Chamber, Mr. Fish by her side,\r\ndiscoursing in a soothing monotone upon the habits of burglars in\r\ngeneral, of which he seemed to have a wide experience.\r\n\r\nLord Caterham, Bundle, and various frightened servants were standing in\r\nthe doorway of the Council Chamber.\r\n\r\n“What the devil’s the matter?” asked Bundle. “Is it burglars? What are\r\nyou and Mr. Fish doing, Virginia? Taking a midnight stroll?”\r\n\r\nVirginia explained the events of the evening.\r\n\r\n“How frightfully exciting,” commented Bundle. “You don’t usually get\r\na murder and a burglary crowded into one week-end. What’s the matter\r\nwith the lights in here? They’re all right everywhere else.”\r\n\r\nThat mystery was soon explained. The bulbs had simply been removed\r\nand laid in a row against the wall. Mounted on a pair of steps, the\r\ndignified Tredwell, dignified even in undress, restored illumination to\r\nthe stricken apartment.\r\n\r\n“If I am not mistaken,” said Lord Caterham in his sad voice as he\r\nlooked around him, “this room has recently been the centre of somewhat\r\nviolent activity.”\r\n\r\nThere was some justice in the remark. Everything that could have\r\nbeen knocked over had been knocked over. The floor was littered with\r\nsplintered chairs, broken china, and fragments of armour.\r\n\r\n“How many of them were there?” asked Bundle. “It seems to have been a\r\ndesperate fight.”\r\n\r\n“Only one, I think,” said Virginia. But, even as she spoke, she\r\nhesitated a little. Certainly only one person—a man—had passed out\r\nthrough the window. But as she had rushed after him, she had had a\r\nvague impression of a rustle somewhere close at hand. If so, the second\r\noccupant of the room could have escaped through the door. Perhaps,\r\nthough, the rustle had been an effect of her own imagination.\r\n\r\nBill appeared suddenly at the window. He was out of breath and panting\r\nhard.\r\n\r\n“Damn the fellow!” he exclaimed wrathfully. “He’s escaped. I’ve been\r\nhunting all over the place. Not a sign of him.”\r\n\r\n“Cheer up, Bill,” said Virginia, “better luck next time.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Lord Caterham, “what do you think we’d better do now? Go\r\nback to bed? I can’t get hold of Badgworthy at this time of night.\r\nTredwell, you know the sort of thing that’s necessary. Just see to it,\r\nwill you?”\r\n\r\n“Very good, my lord.”\r\n\r\nWith a sigh of relief, Lord Caterham prepared to retreat.\r\n\r\n“That beggar, Isaacstein, sleeps soundly,” he remarked, with a touch of\r\nenvy. “You’d have thought all this row would have brought him down.” He\r\nlooked across at Mr. Fish. “You found time to dress, I see,” he added.\r\n\r\n“I flung on a few articles of clothing, yes,” admitted the American.\r\n\r\n“Very sensible of you,” said Lord Caterham. “Damned chilly things,\r\npyjamas.”\r\n\r\nHe yawned. In a rather depressed mood, the house party retired to bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18\r\n\r\nSecond Midnight Adventure\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first person that Anthony saw as he alighted from his train on the\r\nfollowing afternoon was Superintendent Battle. His face broke into a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n“I’ve returned according to contract,” he remarked. “Did you come down\r\nhere to assure yourself of the fact?”\r\n\r\nBattle shook his head.\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t worrying about that, Mr. Cade. I happen to be going to\r\nLondon, that’s all.”\r\n\r\n“You have such a trustful nature, Battle.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think so, sir?”\r\n\r\n“No. I think you’re deep—very deep. Still waters, you know, and all\r\nthat sort of thing. So you’re going to London?”\r\n\r\n“I am, Mr. Cade.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder why.”\r\n\r\nThe detective did not reply.\r\n\r\n“You’re so chatty,” remarked Anthony. “That’s what I like about you.”\r\n\r\nA far-off twinkle showed in Battle’s eyes.\r\n\r\n“What about your own little job, Mr. Cade?” he inquired. “How did that\r\ngo off?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve drawn blank, Battle. For the second time I’ve been proved\r\nhopelessly wrong. Galling, isn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“What was the idea, sir, if I may ask?”\r\n\r\n“I suspected the French governess, Battle. A: Upon the grounds of her\r\nbeing the most unlikely person, according to the canons of the best\r\nfiction. B: Because there was a light in her room on the night of the\r\ntragedy.”\r\n\r\n“That wasn’t much to go upon.”\r\n\r\n“You are quite right. It was not. But I discovered that she had only\r\nbeen here a short time, and I also found a suspicious Frenchman spying\r\nround the place. You know all about him, I suppose?”\r\n\r\n“You mean the man who calls himself M. Chelles? Staying at the\r\n_Cricketers_? A traveller in silk.”\r\n\r\n“That’s it, is it? What about him? What does Scotland Yard think?”\r\n\r\n“His actions have been suspicious,” said Superintendent Battle\r\nexpressionlessly.\r\n\r\n“Very suspicious, I should say. Well, I put two and two together.\r\nFrench governess in the house, French stranger outside. I decided that\r\nthey were in league together, and I hurried off to interview the lady\r\nwith whom Mademoiselle Brun had lived for the last ten years. I was\r\nfully prepared to find that she had never heard of any such person as\r\nMademoiselle Brun, but I was wrong, Battle. Mademoiselle is the genuine\r\narticle.”\r\n\r\nBattle nodded.\r\n\r\n“I must admit,” said Anthony, “that as soon as I spoke to her I had an\r\nuneasy conviction that I was barking up the wrong tree. She seemed so\r\nabsolutely the governess.”\r\n\r\nAgain Battle nodded.\r\n\r\n“All the same, Mr. Cade, you can’t always go by that. Women especially\r\ncan do a lot with make up. I’ve seen quite a pretty girl with the color\r\nof her hair altered, a sallow complexion stain, slightly reddened\r\neyelids and, most efficacious of all, dowdy clothes, who would fail to\r\nbe identified by nine people out of ten who had seen her in her former\r\ncharacter. Men haven’t got quite the same pull. You can do something\r\nwith the eyebrows, and of course different sets of false teeth alter\r\nthe whole expression. But there are always the ears—there’s an\r\nextraordinary lot of character in ears, Mr. Cade.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t look so hard at mine, Battle,” complained Anthony. “You make me\r\nquite nervous.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not talking of false beard and grease paint,” continued the\r\nsuperintendent. “That’s only for books. No, there are very few men\r\nwho can escape identification and put it over on you. In fact there’s\r\nonly one man I know who has a positive genius for impersonation. King\r\nVictor. Ever heard of King Victor, Mr. Cade?”\r\n\r\nThere was something so sharp and sudden about the way the detective put\r\nthe question that Anthony half checked the words that were rising to\r\nhis lips.\r\n\r\n“King Victor?” he said reflectively instead. “Somehow, I seem to have\r\nheard the name.”\r\n\r\n“One of the most celebrated jewel thieves in the world. Irish father,\r\nFrench mother. Can speak five languages at least. He’s been serving a\r\nsentence, but his time was up a few months ago.”\r\n\r\n“Really? And where is he supposed to be now?”\r\n\r\n“Well, Mr. Cade, that’s what we’d rather like to know.”\r\n\r\n“The plot thickens,” said Anthony lightly. “No chance of his turning up\r\nhere, is there? But I suppose he wouldn’t be interested in political\r\nMemoirs—only in jewels.”\r\n\r\n“There’s no saying,” said Superintendent Battle. “For all we know, he\r\nmay be here already.”\r\n\r\n“Disguised as the second footman? Splendid. You’ll recognize him by his\r\nears and cover yourself with glory.”\r\n\r\n“Quite fond of your little joke, aren’t you, Mr. Cade? By the way, what\r\ndo you think of that curious business at Staines?”\r\n\r\n“Staines?” said Anthony. “What’s been happening at Staines?”\r\n\r\n“It was in Saturday’s papers. I thought you might have seen about it.\r\nMan found by the roadside shot. A foreigner. It was in the papers again\r\nto-day, of course.”\r\n\r\n“I did see something about it,” said Anthony carelessly. “Not suicide,\r\napparently.”\r\n\r\n“No. There was no weapon. As yet the man hasn’t been identified.”\r\n\r\n“You seem very interested,” said Anthony, smiling. “No connection with\r\nPrince Michael’s death, is there?”\r\n\r\nHis hand was quite steady. So were his eyes. Was it his fancy that\r\nSuperintendent Battle was looking at him with peculiar intentness?\r\n\r\n“Seems to be quite an epidemic of that sort of thing,” said Battle.\r\n“But, well, I dare say there’s nothing in it.”\r\n\r\nHe turned away, beckoning to a porter as the London train came\r\nthundering in. Anthony drew a faint sigh of relief.\r\n\r\nHe strolled across the park in an unusually thoughtful mood. He\r\npurposely chose to approach the house from the same direction as that\r\nfrom which he had come on the fateful Thursday night, and as he drew\r\nnear to it he looked up at the windows cudgelling his brains to make\r\nsure of the one where he had seen the light. Was he quite sure that it\r\nwas the second from the end?\r\n\r\nAnd, doing so, he made a discovery. There was an angle at the corner of\r\nthe house in which was a window set farther back. Standing on one spot,\r\nyou counted this window as the first, and the first one built out over\r\nthe Council Chamber as the second, but move a few yards to the right\r\nand the part built out over the Council Chamber appeared to be the end\r\nof the house. The first window was invisible, and the two windows of\r\nthe rooms over the Council Chamber would have appeared the first and\r\nsecond from the end. Where exactly had he been standing when he had\r\nseen the light flash up?\r\n\r\nAnthony found the question very hard to determine. A matter of a yard\r\nor so made all the difference. But one point was made abundantly clear.\r\nIt was quite possible that he had been mistaken in describing the light\r\nas occurring in the second room from the end. It might equally well\r\nhave been the _third_.\r\n\r\nNow who occupied the third room? Anthony was determined to find that\r\nout as soon as possible. Fortune favoured him. In the hall Tredwell had\r\njust set the massive silver urn in its place on the tea tray. Nobody\r\nelse was there.\r\n\r\n“Hullo, Tredwell,” said Anthony. “I wanted to ask you something. Who\r\nhas the third room from the end on the West side? Over the Council\r\nChamber, I mean.”\r\n\r\nTredwell reflected for a minute or two.\r\n\r\n“That would be the American gentleman’s room, sir. Mr. Fish.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, is it? Thank you.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all, sir.”\r\n\r\nTredwell prepared to depart, then paused. The desire to be the first to\r\nimpart news makes even pontifical butlers human.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you have heard, sir, of what occurred last night?”\r\n\r\n“Not a word,” said Anthony. “What did occur last night?”\r\n\r\n“An attempt at robbery, sir!”\r\n\r\n“Not really? Was anything taken?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir. The thieves were dismantling the suits of armour in\r\nthe Council Chamber when they were surprised and forced to flee.\r\nUnfortunately they got clear away.”\r\n\r\n“That’s very extraordinary,” said Anthony. “The Council Chamber again.\r\nDid they break in that way?”\r\n\r\n“It is supposed, sir, that they forced the window.”\r\n\r\nSatisfied with the interest his information had aroused Tredwell\r\nresumed his retreat, but brought up short with a dignified apology.\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon, sir. I didn’t hear you come in, and I didn’t know\r\nyou were standing just behind me.”\r\n\r\nMr. Isaacstein who had been the victim of the impact waved his hand in\r\na friendly fashion.\r\n\r\n“No harm done, my good fellow. I assure you no harm done.”\r\n\r\nTredwell retired looking contemptuous, and Isaacstein came forward and\r\ndropped into an easy-chair.\r\n\r\n“Hullo, Cade, so you’re back again. Been hearing all about last night’s\r\nlittle show?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Anthony. “Rather an exciting week-end, isn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“I should imagine that last night was the work of local men,” said\r\nIsaacstein. “It seems a clumsy, amateurish affair.”\r\n\r\n“Is there anyone about here who collects armour?” asked Anthony. “It\r\nseems a curious thing to select.”\r\n\r\n“Very curious,” agreed Mr. Isaacstein. He paused a minute, and then\r\nsaid slowly: “The whole position here is very unfortunate.”\r\n\r\nThere was something almost menacing in his tone.\r\n\r\n“I don’t quite understand,” said Anthony.\r\n\r\n“Why are we all being kept here in this way? The inquest was over\r\nyesterday. The Prince’s body will be removed to London where it is\r\nbeing given out that he died of heart failure. And still nobody is\r\nallowed to leave the house. Mr. Lomax knows no more than I do. He\r\nrefers me to Superintendent Battle.”\r\n\r\n“Superintendent Battle has something up his sleeve,” said Anthony\r\nthoughtfully. “And it seems the essence of his plan that nobody should\r\nleave.”\r\n\r\n“But, excuse me, Mr. Cade, you have been away.”\r\n\r\n“With a string tied to my leg. I’ve no doubt that I was shadowed the\r\nwhole time. I shouldn’t have been given a chance of disposing of the\r\nrevolver or anything of that kind.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, the revolver,” said Isaacstein thoughtfully. “That has not yet\r\nbeen found, I think?”\r\n\r\n“Not yet.”\r\n\r\n“Possibly thrown into the lake in passing.”\r\n\r\n“Very possibly.”\r\n\r\n“Where is Superintendent Battle? I have not seen him this afternoon.”\r\n\r\n“He’s gone to London. I met him at the station.”\r\n\r\n“Gone to London? Really? Did he say when he would be back?”\r\n\r\n“Early to-morrow, so I understood.”\r\n\r\nVirginia came in with Lord Caterham and Mr. Fish. She smiled a welcome\r\nat Anthony.\r\n\r\n“So you’re back, Mr. Cade. Have you heard all about our adventures last\r\nnight?”\r\n\r\n“Why, trooly, Mr. Cade,” said Hiram Fish. “It was a night of strenuous\r\nexcitement. Did you hear that I mistook Mrs. Revel for one of the\r\nthugs?”\r\n\r\n“And in the meantime,” said Anthony, “the thug——?”\r\n\r\n“Got clear away,” said Mr. Fish mournfully.\r\n\r\n“Do pour out,” said Lord Caterham to Virginia. “I don’t know where\r\nBundle is.”\r\n\r\nVirginia officiated. Then she came and sat down near Anthony.\r\n\r\n“Come to the boat-house after tea,” she said in a low voice. “Bill and\r\nI have got a lot to tell you.”\r\n\r\nThen she joined lightly in the general conversation.\r\n\r\nThe meeting at the boat-house was duly held.\r\n\r\nVirginia and Bill were bubbling over with their news. They agreed\r\nthat a boat in the middle of the lake was the only safe place for\r\nconfidential conversation. Having paddled out a sufficient distance,\r\nthe full story of last night’s adventure was related to Anthony. Bill\r\nlooked a little sulky. He wished Virginia would not insist on bringing\r\nthis Colonial fellow into it.\r\n\r\n“It’s very odd,” said Anthony, when the story was finished. “What do\r\nyou make of it?” he asked Virginia.\r\n\r\n“I think they were looking for something,” she returned promptly. “The\r\nburglar idea is absurd.”\r\n\r\n“They thought the something, whatever it was, might be concealed in\r\nthe suits of armour, that’s clear enough. But why tap the panelling?\r\nThat looks more as though they were looking for a secret staircase, or\r\nsomething of that kind.”\r\n\r\n“There’s a Priest’s Hole at Chimneys, I know,” said Virginia. “And I\r\nbelieve there’s a secret staircase as well. Lord Caterham would tell us\r\nall about it. What I want to know is, what can they have been looking\r\nfor?”\r\n\r\n“It can’t be the Memoirs,” said Anthony. “They’re a great bulky\r\npackage. It must have been something small.”\r\n\r\n“George knows, I expect,” said Virginia. “I wonder whether I could get\r\nit out of him. All along I’ve felt there was something behind all this.”\r\n\r\n“You say there was only one man,” pursued Anthony, “but that there\r\nmight possibly be another, as you thought you heard some one going\r\ntowards the door as you sprang to the window.”\r\n\r\n“The sound was very slight,” said Virginia. “It might have been just my\r\nimagination.”\r\n\r\n“That’s quite possible, but in case it wasn’t your imagination the\r\nsecond person must have been an inmate of the house. I wonder now——”\r\n\r\n“What are you wondering at?” asked Virginia.\r\n\r\n“The thoroughness of Mr. Hiram Fish who dresses himself completely when\r\nhe hears screams for help downstairs.”\r\n\r\n“There’s something in that,” agreed Virginia. “And then there’s\r\nIsaacstein who sleeps through it all. That’s suspicious too. Surely he\r\ncouldn’t?”\r\n\r\n“There’s that fellow Boris,” suggested Bill. “He looks an unmitigated\r\nruffian. Michael’s servant, I mean.”\r\n\r\n“Chimneys is full of suspicious characters,” said Virginia. “I dare\r\nsay the others are just as suspicious of us. I wish Superintendent\r\nBattle hadn’t gone to London. I think it’s rather stupid of him. By the\r\nway, Mr. Cade, I’ve seen that peculiar-looking Frenchman about once or\r\ntwice, spying round the park.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a mix up,” confessed Anthony. “I’ve been away on a wild-goose\r\nchase. Made a thorough ass of myself. Look here, to me the whole\r\nquestion seems to resolve itself into this: Did the men find what they\r\nwere looking for last night?”\r\n\r\n“Supposing they didn’t?” said Virginia. “I’m pretty sure they didn’t,\r\nas a matter of fact.”\r\n\r\n“Just this, I believe they’ll come again. They know, or they soon will\r\nknow, that Battle’s in London. They’ll take the risk and come again\r\nto-night.”\r\n\r\n“Do you really think so?”\r\n\r\n“It’s a chance. Now we three will form a little syndicate. Eversleigh\r\nand I will conceal ourselves with due precautions in the Council\r\nChamber——”\r\n\r\n“What about me?” interrupted Virginia. “Don’t think you’re going to\r\nleave me out of it.”\r\n\r\n“Listen to me, Virginia,” said Bill. “This is man’s work——”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be an idiot, Bill. I’m in on this. Don’t you make any mistake\r\nabout it. The syndicate will keep watch to-night.”\r\n\r\nIt was settled thus, and the details of the plan were laid. After the\r\nparty had retired to bed, first one and then another of the syndicate\r\ncrept down. They were all armed with powerful electric torches, and in\r\nthe pocket of Anthony’s coat lay a revolver.\r\n\r\nAnthony had said that he believed another attempt to resume the search\r\nwould be made. Nevertheless, he did not expect that the attempt would\r\nbe made from outside. He believed that Virginia had been correct in her\r\nguess that some one had passed her in the dark the night before, and as\r\nhe stood in the shadow of an old oak dresser it was towards the door\r\nand not the window that his eyes were directed. Virginia was crouching\r\nbehind a figure in armour on the opposite wall, and Bill was by the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nThe minutes passed, at interminable length. One o’clock chimed, then\r\nthe half-hour, then two, then another half-hour. Anthony felt stiff and\r\ncramped. He was coming slowly to the conclusion that he had been wrong.\r\nNo attempt would be made to-night.\r\n\r\nAnd then he stiffened suddenly, all his senses on the alert. He had\r\nheard a footstep on the terrace outside. Silence again, then a low\r\nscratching noise at the window. Suddenly it ceased, and the window\r\nswung open. A man stepped across the sill into the room.\r\n\r\nHe stood quite still for a moment, peering round as though listening.\r\nAfter a minute or two, seemingly satisfied, he switched on a torch\r\nhe carried, and turned it rapidly round the room. Apparently he saw\r\nnothing unusual. The three watchers held their breath.\r\n\r\nHe went over to the same bit of panelled wall he had been examining the\r\nnight before.\r\n\r\nAnd then a terrible knowledge smote Bill. He was going to sneeze! The\r\nwild race through the dew-laden park the night before had given him a\r\nchill. All day he had sneezed intermittently. A sneeze was due now, and\r\nnothing on earth would stop it.\r\n\r\nHe adopted all the remedies he could think of. He pressed his upper\r\nlip, swallowed hard, threw back his head and looked at the ceiling. As\r\na last resort he held his nose, and pinched it violently. It was of no\r\navail. He sneezed.\r\n\r\nA stifled, checked, emasculated sneeze, but a startling sound in the\r\ndeadly quiet of the room.\r\n\r\nThe stranger sprang round, and in the same minute Anthony acted. He\r\nflashed on his torch, and jumped full for the stranger. In another\r\nminute they were down on the floor together.\r\n\r\n“Lights,” shouted Anthony.\r\n\r\nVirginia was ready at the switch. The lights came on true and full\r\nto-night. Anthony was on top of his man, Bill leant down to give him a\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n“And now,” said Anthony, “let’s see who you are, my fine fellow.”\r\n\r\nHe rolled his victim over. It was the neat, dark-bearded stranger from\r\nthe _Cricketers_.\r\n\r\n“Very nice indeed,” said an approving voice.\r\n\r\nThey all looked up startled. The bulky form of Superintendent Battle\r\nwas standing in the open doorway.\r\n\r\n“I thought you were in London, Superintendent Battle,” said Anthony.\r\n\r\nBattle’s eyes twinkled.\r\n\r\n“Did you, sir?” he said. “Well, I thought it would be a good thing if I\r\nwas thought to be going.”\r\n\r\n“And it has been,” agreed Anthony, looking down at his prostrate foe.\r\n\r\nTo his surprise there was a slight smile on the stranger’s face.\r\n\r\n“May I get up, gentlemen?” he inquired. “You are three to one.”\r\n\r\nAnthony kindly hauled him on to his legs. The stranger settled his\r\ncoat, pulled up his collar, and directed a keen look at Battle.\r\n\r\n“I demand pardon,” he said, “but do I understand that you are a\r\nrepresentative from Scotland Yard?”\r\n\r\n“That’s right,” said Battle.\r\n\r\n“Then I will present to you my credentials.” He smiled rather ruefully.\r\n“I would have been wise to do so before.”\r\n\r\nHe took some papers from his pocket and handed them to the Scotland\r\nYard detective. At the same time, he turned back the lapel of his coat\r\nand showed something pinned there.\r\n\r\nBattle gave an exclamation of astonishment. He looked through the\r\npapers and handed them back with a little bow.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry you’ve been man-handled, monsieur,” he said, “but you\r\nbrought it on yourself, you know.”\r\n\r\nHe smiled, noting the astonished expression on the faces of the other.\r\n\r\n“This is a colleague we have been expecting for some time,” he said.\r\n“M. Lemoine, of the Sûreté in Paris.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19\r\n\r\nSecret History\r\n\r\n\r\nThey all stared at the French detective, who smiled back at them.\r\n\r\n“But yes,” he said, “it is true.”\r\n\r\nThere was a pause for a general readjusting of ideas. Then Virginia\r\nturned to Battle.\r\n\r\n“Do you know what I think, Superintendent Battle?”\r\n\r\n“What do you think, Mrs. Revel?”\r\n\r\n“I think the time has come to enlighten us a little.”\r\n\r\n“To enlighten you? I don’t quite understand, Mrs. Revel.”\r\n\r\n“Superintendent Battle, you understand perfectly. I dare say Mr. Lomax\r\nhas hedged you about with recommendations of secrecy—George would,\r\nbut surely it’s better to tell us than have us stumbling on the secret\r\nall by ourselves, and perhaps doing untold harm. M. Lemoine, don’t you\r\nagree with me?”\r\n\r\n“Madame, I agree with you entirely.”\r\n\r\n“You can’t go on keeping things dark for ever,” said Battle. “I’ve\r\ntold Mr. Lomax so. Mr. Eversleigh is Mr. Lomax’s secretary, there’s no\r\nobjection to his knowing what there is to know. As for Mr. Cade, he’s\r\nbeen brought into the thing willy-nilly, and I consider he’s a right to\r\nknow where he stands. But——”\r\n\r\nBattle paused.\r\n\r\n“I know,” said Virginia. “Women are so indiscreet! I’ve often heard\r\nGeorge say so.”\r\n\r\nLemoine had been studying Virginia attentively. Now he turned to the\r\nScotland Yard man.\r\n\r\n“Did I hear you just now address Madame by the name of Revel?”\r\n\r\n“That is my name,” said Virginia.\r\n\r\n“Your husband was in the Diplomatic Service, was he not? And you were\r\nwith him in Herzoslovakia just before the assassination of the late\r\nKing and Queen.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nLemoine turned again.\r\n\r\n“I think Madame has a right to hear the story. She is indirectly\r\nconcerned. Moreover”—his eyes twinkled a little—“Madame’s reputation\r\nfor discretion stands very high in Diplomatic circles.”\r\n\r\n“I’m glad they give me a good character,” said Virginia, laughing. “And\r\nI’m glad I’m not going to be left out of it.”\r\n\r\n“What about refreshments?” said Anthony. “Where does the conference\r\ntake place? Here?”\r\n\r\n“If you please, sir,” said Battle, “I’ve a fancy for not leaving this\r\nroom until morning. You’ll see why when you’ve heard the story.”\r\n\r\n“Then I’ll go and forage,” said Anthony.\r\n\r\nBill went with him and they returned with a tray of glasses, siphons\r\nand other necessaries of life.\r\n\r\nThe augmented syndicate established itself comfortably in the corner by\r\nthe window, being grouped round a long oak table.\r\n\r\n“It’s understood, of course,” said Battle, “that anything that’s said\r\nhere is said in strict confidence. There must be no leakage. I’ve\r\nalways felt it would come out one of these days. Gentlemen like Mr.\r\nLomax who want everything hushed up take bigger risks than they think.\r\nThe start of this business was just over seven years ago. There was a\r\nlot of what they call Reconstruction going on—especially in the Near\r\nEast. There was a good deal going on in England, strictly on the Q.T.\r\nwith that old gentleman, Count Stylptitch, pulling the strings. All\r\nthe Balkan States were interested parties, and there were a lot of\r\nRoyal Personages in England just then. I’m not going into details,\r\nbut Something disappeared—disappeared in a way that seemed incredible\r\nunless you admitted two things—that the thief was a Royal Personage\r\nand that at the same time it was the work of a high-class professional.\r\nM. Lemoine here will tell you how that well might be.”\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman bowed courteously and took up the tale.\r\n\r\n“It is possible that you in England may not even have heard of our\r\nfamous and fantastic King Victor. What his real name is, no one knows,\r\nbut he is a man of singular courage and daring, one who speaks five\r\nlanguages and is unequalled in the art of disguise. Though his father\r\nis known to have been either English or Irish, he himself has worked\r\nchiefly in Paris. It was there, nearly eight years ago, that he was\r\ncarrying out a daring series of robberies and living under the name of\r\nCaptain O’Neill.”\r\n\r\nA faint exclamation escaped Virginia. M. Lemoine darted a keen glance\r\nat her.\r\n\r\n“I think I understand what agitates Madame. You will see in a minute.\r\nNow we of the Sûreté had our suspicions that this Captain O’Neill was\r\nnone other than ‘King Victor,’ but we could not obtain the necessary\r\nproof. There was also in Paris at the time a clever young actress,\r\nAngèle Mory, of the Folies Bergères. For some time we had suspected\r\nthat she was associated with the operations of King Victor. But again\r\nno proof was forthcoming.\r\n\r\n“About that time, Paris was preparing for the visit of the young King\r\nNicholas IV of Herzoslovakia. At the Sûreté we were given special\r\ninstructions as to the course to be adopted to ensure the safety of His\r\nMajesty. In particular we were warned to superintend the activities of\r\na certain Revolutionary organization which called itself the Comrades\r\nof the Red Hand. It is fairly certain now that the Comrades approached\r\nAngèle Mory and offered her a huge sum if she would aid them in their\r\nplans. Her part was to infatuate the young King, and decoy him to\r\nsome spot agreed upon with them. Angèle Mory accepted the bribe and\r\npromised to perform her part.\r\n\r\n“But the young lady was cleverer and more ambitious than her employers\r\nsuspected. She succeeded in captivating the King who fell desperately\r\nin love with her and loaded her with jewels. It was then that she\r\nconceived the idea of being—not a King’s mistress, but a Queen! As\r\nevery one knows, she realized her ambition. She was introduced into\r\nHerzoslovakia as the Countess Varaga Popoleffsky, an offshoot of the\r\nRomanoffs, and became eventually Queen Varaga of Herzoslovakia. Not\r\nbad for a little Parisian actress! I have always heard that she played\r\nthe part extremely well. But her triumph was not to be long lived. The\r\nComrades of the Red Hand, furious at her betrayal, twice attempted\r\nher life. Finally they worked up the country to such a pitch that a\r\nRevolution broke out in which both the King and Queen perished. Their\r\nbodies, horribly mutilated and hardly recognizable, were recovered,\r\nattesting to the fury of the populace against the low-born foreign\r\nQueen.\r\n\r\n“Now, in all this, it seems certain that Queen Varaga still kept in\r\nwith her confederate, King Victor. It is possible that the bold plan\r\nwas his all along. What is known is that she continued to correspond\r\nwith him, in a secret code, from the Court of Herzoslovakia. For safety\r\nthe letters were written in English, and signed with the name of an\r\nEnglish lady then at the Embassy. If any inquiry had been made, and\r\nthe lady in question had denied her signature, it is possible that she\r\nwould not have been believed, for the letters were those of a guilty\r\nwoman to her lover. It was your name she used, Mrs. Revel.”\r\n\r\n“I know,” said Virginia. Her colour was coming and going unevenly. “So\r\nthat is the truth of the letters! I have wondered and wondered.”\r\n\r\n“What a blackguardly trick,” cried Bill indignantly.\r\n\r\n“The letters were addressed to Captain O’Neill at his rooms in Paris,\r\nand their principal purpose may have light shed upon it by a curious\r\nfact which came to light later. After the assassination of the King\r\nand Queen, many of the Crown Jewels which had fallen, of course, into\r\nthe hands of the mob, found their way to Paris, and it was discovered\r\nthat in nine cases out of ten the principal stones had been replaced\r\nby paste—and mind you, there were some very famous stones among the\r\njewels of Herzoslovakia. So as a Queen, Angèle Mory still practised her\r\nformer activities.\r\n\r\n“You see now where we have arrived. Nicholas IV and Queen Varaga came\r\nto England and were the guests of the late Marquis of Caterham, then\r\nSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Herzoslovakia is a small\r\ncountry, but it could not be left out. Queen Varaga was necessarily\r\nreceived. And there we have a Royal Personage and at the same time an\r\nexpert thief. There is also no doubt that the—er—substitute which was\r\nso wonderful as to deceive anyone but an expert could only have been\r\nfashioned by King Victor, and indeed the whole plan, in its daring and\r\naudacity, pointed to him as the author.”\r\n\r\n“What happened?” asked Virginia.\r\n\r\n“Hushed up,” said Superintendent Battle laconically. “Not a mention of\r\nit’s ever been made public to this day. We did all that could be done\r\non the quiet—and that was a good deal more than you’d ever imagine, by\r\nthe way. We’ve got methods of our own that would surprise. That jewel\r\ndidn’t leave England with the Queen of Herzoslovakia—I can tell you\r\nthat much. No, Her Majesty hid it somewhere—but where we’ve never been\r\nable to discover. But I shouldn’t wonder”—Superintendent Battle let\r\nhis eyes wander gently round—“if it wasn’t somewhere in this room.”\r\n\r\nAnthony leapt to his feet.\r\n\r\n“What? After all these years?” he cried incredulously. “Impossible.”\r\n\r\n“You do not know the peculiar circumstances, monsieur,” said the\r\nFrenchman quickly. “Only a fortnight later, the Revolution in\r\nHerzoslovakia broke out, and the King and Queen were murdered. Also,\r\nCaptain O’Neill was arrested in Paris and sentenced on a minor charge.\r\nWe hoped to find the packet of code letters in his house, but it\r\nappears that this had been stolen by some Herzoslovakian go-between.\r\nThe man turned up in Herzoslovakia just before the Revolution, and then\r\ndisappeared completely.”\r\n\r\n“He probably went abroad,” said Anthony thoughtfully. “To Africa as\r\nlikely as not. And you bet he hung on to that packet. It was as good\r\nas a gold mine to him. It’s odd how things come about. They probably\r\ncalled him Dutch Pedro or something like that out there.”\r\n\r\nHe caught Superintendent Battle’s expressionless glance bent upon him,\r\nand smiled.\r\n\r\n“It’s not really clairvoyance, Battle,” he said, “though it sounds like\r\nit. I’ll tell you presently.”\r\n\r\n“There is one thing you have not explained,” said Virginia. “Where does\r\nthis link up with the Memoirs? There must be a link, surely?”\r\n\r\n“Madame is very quick,” said Lemoine approvingly. “Yes, there is a\r\nlink. Count Stylptitch was also staying at Chimneys at the time.”\r\n\r\n“So that he might have known about it?”\r\n\r\n“_Parfaitement._”\r\n\r\n“And, of course,” said Battle, “if he’s blurted it out in his precious\r\nMemoirs, the fat will be in the fire. Especially after the way the\r\nwhole thing was hushed up.”\r\n\r\nAnthony lit a cigarette.\r\n\r\n“There’s no possibility of there being a clue in the Memoirs as to\r\nwhere the stone was hidden?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Very unlikely,” said Battle decisively. “He was never in with the\r\nQueen—opposed the marriage tooth and nail. She’s not likely to have\r\ntaken him into her confidence.”\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t suggesting such a thing for a minute,” said Anthony. “But\r\nby all accounts he was a cunning old boy. Unknown to her, he may have\r\ndiscovered where she hid the jewel. In that case, what would he have\r\ndone, do you think?”\r\n\r\n“Sat tight,” said Battle, after a moment’s reflection.\r\n\r\n“I agree,” said the Frenchman. “It was a ticklish moment, you see. To\r\nreturn the stone anonymously would have presented great difficulties.\r\nAlso, the knowledge of its whereabouts would give him great power—and\r\nhe liked power, that strange old man. Not only did he hold the Queen\r\nin the hollow of his hand, but he had a powerful weapon to negotiate\r\nwith at any time. It was not the only secret he possessed—oh, no!—he\r\ncollected secrets like some men collect rare pieces of china. It is\r\nsaid that, once or twice before his death, he boasted to people of the\r\nthings he could make public if the fancy took him. And once at least\r\nhe declared that he intended to make some startling revelations in\r\nhis Memoirs. Hence”—the Frenchman smiled rather dryly—“the general\r\nanxiety to get hold of them. Our own secret police intended to seize\r\nthem, but the Count took the precaution to have them conveyed away\r\nbefore his death.”\r\n\r\n“Still, there’s no real reason to believe that he knew this particular\r\nsecret,” said Battle.\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon,” said Anthony quietly. “There are his own words.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\nBoth detectives stared at him as though unable to believe their ears.\r\n\r\n“When Mr. McGrath gave me that manuscript to bring to England, he\r\ntold me the circumstances of his one meeting with Count Stylptitch.\r\nIt was in Paris. At some considerable risk to himself, Mr. McGrath\r\nrescued the Count from a band of Apaches. He was, I understand—shall\r\nwe say a trifle—exhilarated? Being in that condition, he made two\r\nrather interesting remarks. One of them was to the effect that he knew\r\nwhere the Koh-i-noor was—a statement to which my friend paid very\r\nlittle attention. He also said that the gang in question were King\r\nVictor’s men. Taken together, those two remarks are very significant.”\r\n\r\n“Good Lord,” ejaculated Superintendent Battle, “I should say they were.\r\nEven the murder of Prince Michael wears a different aspect.”\r\n\r\n“King Victor has never taken a life,” the Frenchman reminded him.\r\n\r\n“Supposing he were surprised when he was searching for the jewel?”\r\n\r\n“Is he in England, then?” asked Anthony sharply. “You say that he was\r\nreleased a few months ago. Didn’t you keep track of him?”\r\n\r\nA rather rueful smile overspread the French detective’s face.\r\n\r\n“We tried to, monsieur. But he is a devil, that man. He gave us the\r\nslip at once—at once. We thought, of course, that he would make\r\nstraight for England. But no. He went—where do you think?”\r\n\r\n“Where?” said Anthony.\r\n\r\nHe was staring intently at the Frenchman, and absent-mindedly his\r\nfingers played with a box of matches.\r\n\r\n“To America. To the United States.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\nThere was sheer amazement in Anthony’s tone.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and what do you think he called himself? What part do you think\r\nhe played over there? The part of Prince Nicholas of Herzoslovakia.”\r\n\r\nThe match-box fell from Anthony’s hand, but his amazement was fully\r\nequalled by that of Battle.\r\n\r\n“Impossible.”\r\n\r\n“Not so, my friend. You, too, will get the news in the morning. It\r\nhas been the most colossal bluff. As you know, Prince Nicholas was\r\nrumoured to have died in the Congo years ago. Our friend, King Victor,\r\nseizes on that—difficult to prove a death of that kind. He resurrects\r\nPrince Nicholas, and plays him to such purpose that he gets away with a\r\ntremendous haul of American dollars—all on account of the supposed oil\r\nconcessions. But by a mere accident, he was unmasked, and had to leave\r\nthe country hurriedly. This time he did come to England. And that is\r\nwhy I am here. Sooner or later he will come to Chimneys. That is, if he\r\nis not already here!”\r\n\r\n“You think—that?”\r\n\r\n“I think he was here the night Prince Michael died, and again last\r\nnight.”\r\n\r\n“It was another attempt, eh?” said Battle.\r\n\r\n“It was another attempt.”\r\n\r\n“What has bothered me,” continued Battle, “was wondering what had\r\nbecome of M. Lemoine here. I’d had word from Paris that he was on his\r\nway over to work with me, and I couldn’t make out why he hadn’t turned\r\nup.”\r\n\r\n“I must indeed apologize,” said Lemoine. “You see, I arrived on the\r\nmorning after the murder. It occurred to me at once that it would\r\nbe as well for me to study things from an unofficial standpoint\r\nwithout appearing officially as your colleague. I thought that great\r\npossibilities lay that way. I was, of course, aware that I was bound to\r\nbe an object of suspicion, but that in a way furthered my plan since it\r\nwould not put people I was after on their guard. I can assure you that\r\nI have seen a good deal that is interesting in the last two days.”\r\n\r\n“But look here,” said Bill, “what really did happen last night?”\r\n\r\n“I am afraid,” said M. Lemoine, “that I gave you rather violent\r\nexercise.”\r\n\r\n“It was you I chased then?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I will recount things to you. I came up here to watch, convinced\r\nthat the secret had to do with this room since the Prince had been\r\nkilled here. I stood outside on the terrace. Presently I became aware\r\nthat some one was moving about in this room. I could see the flash of a\r\ntorch now and again. I tried the middle window and found it unlatched.\r\nWhether the man had entered that way earlier, or whether he had left\r\nit so as a blind in case he was disturbed, I do not know. Very gently,\r\nI pushed it back and slipped inside the room. Step by step I felt\r\nmy way until I was in a spot where I could watch operations without\r\nlikelihood of being discovered myself. The man himself I could not see\r\nclearly. His back was to me, of course, and he was silhouetted against\r\nthe light of the torch so that his outline only could be seen. But his\r\nactions filled me with surprise. He took to pieces first one and then\r\nthe other of those two suits of armour, examining each one piece by\r\npiece. When he had convinced himself that what he sought was not there,\r\nhe began tapping the panelling of the wall under that picture. What he\r\nwould have done next, I do not know. The interruption came. _You_ burst\r\nin——” He looked at Bill.\r\n\r\n“Our well-meant interference was really rather a pity,” said Virginia\r\nthoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“In a sense, madame, it was. The man switched out his torch, and I, who\r\nhad no wish as yet to be forced to reveal my identity, sprang for the\r\nwindow. I collided with the other two in the dark, and fell headlong. I\r\nsprang up and out through the window. Mr. Eversleigh, taking me for his\r\nassailant, followed.”\r\n\r\n“I followed you first,” said Virginia. “Bill was only second in the\r\nrace.”\r\n\r\n“And the other fellow had the sense to stay still and sneak out through\r\nthe door. I wonder he didn’t meet the rescuing crowd.”\r\n\r\n“That would present no difficulties,” said Lemoine. “He would be a\r\nrescuer in advance of the rest, that was all.”\r\n\r\n“Do you really think this Arsène Lupin fellow is actually among the\r\nhousehold now?” asked Bill, his eyes sparkling.\r\n\r\n“Why not?” said Lemoine. “He could pass perfectly as a servant. For all\r\nwe may know, he may be Boris Anchoukoff, the trusted servant of the\r\nlate Prince Michael.”\r\n\r\n“He is an odd-looking bloke,” agreed Bill.\r\n\r\nBut Anthony was smiling.\r\n\r\n“That’s hardly worthy of you, M. Lemoine,” he said gently.\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman smiled too.\r\n\r\n“You’ve taken him on as your valet now, haven’t you, Mr. Cade?” asked\r\nSuperintendent Battle.\r\n\r\n“Battle, I take off my hat to you. You know everything. But just as a\r\nmatter of detail, he’s taken me on, not I him.”\r\n\r\n“Why was that, I wonder, Mr. Cade?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” said Anthony lightly. “It’s a curious taste, but\r\nperhaps he may have liked my face. Or he may think I murdered his\r\nmaster and wish to establish himself in a handy position for executing\r\nrevenge upon me.”\r\n\r\nHe rose and went over to the windows, pulling the curtains.\r\n\r\n“Daylight,” he said, with a slight yawn. “There won’t be any more\r\nexcitements now.”\r\n\r\nLemoine rose also.\r\n\r\n“I will leave you,” he said. “We shall perhaps meet again later in the\r\nday.”\r\n\r\nWith a graceful bow to Virginia, he stepped out of the window.\r\n\r\n“Bed,” said Virginia, yawning. “It’s all been very exciting. Come on,\r\nBill, go to bed like a good little boy. The breakfast table will see us\r\nnot, I fear.”\r\n\r\nAnthony stayed at the window looking after the retreating form of M.\r\nLemoine.\r\n\r\n“You wouldn’t think it,” said Battle behind him, “but that’s supposed\r\nto be the cleverest detective in France.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know that I wouldn’t,” said Anthony thoughtfully. “I rather\r\nthink I would.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Battle, “he was right about the excitements of this night\r\nbeing over. By the way, do you remember my telling you about that man\r\nthey’d found shot near Staines?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Why?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing. They’ve identified him, that’s all. It seems he was called\r\nGiuseppe Manelli. He was a waiter at the Blitz in London. Curious,\r\nisn’t it?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n20\r\n\r\nBattle and Anthony Confer\r\n\r\n\r\nAnthony said nothing. He continued to stare out of the window.\r\nSuperintendent Battle looked for some time at his motionless back.\r\n\r\n“Well, good night, sir,” he said at last, and moved to the door.\r\n\r\nAnthony stirred.\r\n\r\n“Wait a minute, Battle.”\r\n\r\nThe superintendent halted obediently. Anthony left the window. He drew\r\nout a cigarette from his case and lighted it. Then, between two puffs\r\nof smoke, he said:\r\n\r\n“You seem very interested in this business at Staines?”\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t go as far as that, sir. It’s unusual, that’s all.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think the man was shot where he was found, or do you think\r\nhe was killed elsewhere and the body brought to that particular spot\r\nafterwards?”\r\n\r\n“I think he was shot somewhere else, and the body brought there in a\r\ncar.”\r\n\r\n“I think so too,” said Anthony.\r\n\r\nSomething in the emphasis of his tone made the detective look up\r\nsharply.\r\n\r\n“Any ideas of your own, sir? Do you know who brought him there?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Anthony. “I did.”\r\n\r\nHe was a little annoyed at the absolutely unruffled calm preserved by\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n“I must say you take these shocks very well, Battle,” he remarked.\r\n\r\n“‘Never display emotion.’ That was a rule that was given to me once,\r\nand I’ve found it very useful.”\r\n\r\n“You live up to it, certainly,” said Anthony. “I can’t say I’ve ever\r\nseen you ruffled. Well, do you want to hear the whole story?”\r\n\r\n“If you please, Mr. Cade.”\r\n\r\nAnthony pulled up two of the chairs, both men sat down, and Anthony\r\nrecounted the events of the preceding Thursday night.\r\n\r\nBattle listened immovably. There was a far-off twinkle in his eyes as\r\nAnthony finished.\r\n\r\n“You know, sir,” he said, “You’ll get into trouble one of these days.”\r\n\r\n“Then, for the second time, I’m not to be taken into custody?”\r\n\r\n“We always like to give a man plenty of rope,” said Superintendent\r\nBattle.\r\n\r\n“Very delicately put,” said Anthony. “Without unduly stressing the end\r\nof the proverb.”\r\n\r\n“What I can’t quite make out, sir,” said Battle, “is why you decided to\r\ncome across with this now?”\r\n\r\n“It’s rather difficult to explain,” said Anthony. “You see, Battle,\r\nI’ve come to have really a very high opinion of your abilities. When\r\nthe moment comes, you’re always there. Look at to-night. And it\r\noccurred to me that, in withholding this knowledge of mine, I was\r\nseriously cramping your style. You deserve to have access to all the\r\nfacts. I’ve done what I could, and up to now I’ve made a mess of\r\nthings. Until to-night, I couldn’t speak for Mrs. Revel’s sake. But now\r\nthat those letters have been definitely proved to have nothing whatever\r\nto do with her, any idea of her complicity becomes absurd. Perhaps\r\nI advised her badly in the first place, but it struck me that her\r\nstatement of having paid this man money to suppress the letters, simply\r\nas a whim, might take a bit of believing.”\r\n\r\n“It might, by a jury,” agreed Battle. “Juries never have any\r\nimagination.”\r\n\r\n“But you accept it quite easily?” said Anthony, looking curiously at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Well, you see, Mr. Cade, most of my work has lain amongst these\r\npeople. What they call the upper classes, I mean. You see, the majority\r\nof people are always wondering what the neighbours will think. But\r\ntramps and aristocrats don’t—they just do the first thing that comes\r\ninto their heads, and they don’t bother to think what anyone thinks\r\nof them. I’m not meaning just the idle rich, the people who give big\r\nparties, and so on, I mean those that have had it born and bred in\r\nthem for generations that nobody else’s opinion counts but their own.\r\nI’ve always found the upper classes the same—fearless, truthful and\r\nsometimes extraordinarily foolish.”\r\n\r\n“This is a very interesting lecture, Battle. I suppose you’ll be\r\nwriting your Reminiscences one of these days. They ought to be worth\r\nreading too.”\r\n\r\nThe detective acknowledged the suggestion with a smile, but said\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n“I’d rather like to ask you one question,” continued Anthony. “Did you\r\nconnect me at all with the Staines affair? I fancied, from your manner,\r\nthat you did.”\r\n\r\n“Quite right. I had a hunch that way. But nothing definite to go upon.\r\nYour manner was very good, if I may say so, Mr. Cade. You never overdid\r\nthe carelessness.”\r\n\r\n“I’m glad of that,” said Anthony. “I’ve a feeling that ever since I met\r\nyou you’ve been laying little traps for me. On the whole I’ve managed\r\nto avoid falling into them, but the strain has been acute.”\r\n\r\nBattle smiled grimly.\r\n\r\n“That’s how you get a crook in the end, sir. Keep him on the run, to\r\nand fro, turning and twisting. Sooner or later, his nerve goes, and\r\nyou’ve got him.”\r\n\r\n“You’re a cheerful fellow, Battle. When will you get me, I wonder?”\r\n\r\n“Plenty of rope, sir,” quoted the superintendent, “plenty of rope.”\r\n\r\n“In the meantime,” said Anthony, “I am still the amateur assistant?”\r\n\r\n“That’s it, Mr. Cade.”\r\n\r\n“Watson to your Sherlock, in fact?”\r\n\r\n“Detective stories are mostly bunkum,” said Battle unemotionally. “But\r\nthey amuse people,” he added, as an afterthought. “And they’re useful\r\nsometimes.”\r\n\r\n“In what way?” asked Anthony curiously.\r\n\r\n“They encourage the universal idea that the police are stupid. When we\r\nget an amateur crime, such as a murder, that’s very useful indeed.”\r\n\r\nAnthony looked at him for some minutes in silence. Battle sat quite\r\nstill, blinking now and then, with no expression whatsoever on his\r\nsquare placid face. Presently he rose.\r\n\r\n“Not much good going to bed now,” he observed. “As soon as he’s up, I\r\nwant to have a few words with his lordship. Anyone who wants to leave\r\nthe house can do so now. At the same time I should be much obliged to\r\nhis lordship if he’ll extend an informal invitation to his guests to\r\nstay on. You’ll accept it, sir, if you please, and Mrs. Revel also.”\r\n\r\n“Have you ever found the revolver?” asked Anthony suddenly.\r\n\r\n“You mean the one Prince Michael was shot with? No, I haven’t. Yet\r\nit must be in the house or grounds. I’ll take a hint from you, Mr.\r\nCade, and send some boys up bird’s-nesting. If I could get hold of the\r\nrevolver, we might get forward a bit. That, and the bundle of letters.\r\nYou say that a letter with the heading, Chimneys, was amongst them?\r\nDepend upon it that was the last one written. The instructions for\r\nfinding the diamond are written in code in that letter.”\r\n\r\n“What’s your theory of the killing of Giuseppe?” asked Anthony.\r\n\r\n“I should say he was a regular thief, and that he was got hold of,\r\neither by King Victor or by the Comrades of the Red Hand, and employed\r\nby them. I shouldn’t wonder at all if the Comrades and King Victor\r\naren’t working together. The organization has plenty of money and\r\npower, but it isn’t very strong in brains. Giuseppe’s task was to steal\r\nthe Memoirs—they couldn’t have known that you had the letters—it’s a\r\nvery odd coincidence that you should have, by the way.”\r\n\r\n“I know,” said Anthony. “It’s amazing when you come to think of it.”\r\n\r\n“Giuseppe gets hold of the letters instead. Is at first vastly\r\nchagrined. Then sees the cutting from the paper and has the brilliant\r\nidea of turning them to account on his own by blackmailing the lady. He\r\nhas, of course, no idea of their real significance. The Comrades find\r\nout what he is doing, believe that he is deliberately double crossing\r\nthem, and decree his death. They’re very fond of executing traitors.\r\nIt has a picturesque element which seems to appeal to them. What I\r\ncan’t quite make out is the revolver with ‘Virginia’ engraved upon it.\r\nThere’s too much finesse about that for the Comrades. As a rule, they\r\nenjoy plastering their Red Hand sign about—in order to strike terror\r\ninto other would-be traitors. No, it looks to me as though King Victor\r\nhad stepped in there. But what his motive was, I don’t know. It looks\r\nlike a very deliberate attempt to saddle Mrs. Revel with the murder,\r\nand, on the surface, there doesn’t seem any particular point in that.”\r\n\r\n“I had a theory,” said Anthony. “But it didn’t work out according to\r\nplan.”\r\n\r\nHe told Battle of Virginia’s recognition of Michael. Battle nodded his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, no doubt as to his identity. By the way, that old Baron has a\r\nvery high opinion of you. He speaks of you in most enthusiastic terms.”\r\n\r\n“That’s very kind of him,” said Anthony. “Especially as I’ve given him\r\nfull warning that I mean to do my utmost to get hold of the missing\r\nMemoirs before Wednesday next.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll have a job to do that,” said Battle.\r\n\r\n“Y—es. You think so? I suppose King Victor and Co. have got the\r\nletters.”\r\n\r\nBattle nodded.\r\n\r\n“Pinched them off Giuseppe that day in Pont Street. Prettily planned\r\npiece of work, that. Yes, they’ve got ’em all right, and they’ve\r\ndecoded them, and they know where to look.”\r\n\r\nBoth men were on the point of passing out of the room.\r\n\r\n“In here?” said Anthony, jerking his head back.\r\n\r\n“Exactly, in here. But they haven’t found the prize yet, and they’re\r\ngoing to run a pretty risk trying to get it.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose,” said Anthony, “that you’ve got a plan in that subtle head\r\nof yours?”\r\n\r\nBattle returned no answer. He looked particularly stolid and\r\nunintelligent. Then, very slowly, he winked.\r\n\r\n“Want my help?” asked Anthony.\r\n\r\n“I do. And I shall want some one else’s.”\r\n\r\n“Who is that?”\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Revel’s. You may not have noticed it, Mr. Cade, but she’s a lady\r\nwho has a particularly beguiling way with her.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve noticed it all right,” said Anthony.\r\n\r\nHe glanced at his watch.\r\n\r\n“I’m inclined to agree with you about bed, Battle. A dip in the lake\r\nand a hearty breakfast will be far more to the point.”\r\n\r\nHe ran lightly upstairs to his bedroom. Whistling to himself, he\r\ndiscarded his evening clothes, and picked up a dressing-gown and a bath\r\ntowel.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly he stopped dead in front of the dressing-table, staring\r\nat the object that reposed demurely in front of the looking-glass.\r\n\r\nFor a moment he could not believe his eyes. He took it up, examined it\r\nclosely. Yes, there was no mistake.\r\n\r\nIt was the bundle of letters signed Virginia Revel. They were intact.\r\nNot one was missing.\r\n\r\nAnthony dropped into a chair, the letters in his hand.\r\n\r\n“My brain must be cracking,” he murmured. “I can’t understand a quarter\r\nof what is going on in this house. Why should the letters reappear like\r\na damned conjuring trick? Who put them on my dressing-table? Why?”\r\n\r\nAnd to all these very pertinent questions he could find no satisfactory\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21\r\n\r\nMr. Isaacstein’s Suit-case\r\n\r\n\r\nAt ten o’clock that morning, Lord Caterham and his daughter were\r\nbreakfasting. Bundle was looking very thoughtful.\r\n\r\n“Father,” she said at last.\r\n\r\nLord Caterham, absorbed in _The Times_, did not reply.\r\n\r\n“Father,” said Bundle again, more sharply.\r\n\r\nLord Caterham, torn from his interested perusal of forthcoming sales of\r\nrare books, looked up absent-mindedly.\r\n\r\n“Eh?” he said. “Did you speak?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Who is it who’s had breakfast?”\r\n\r\nShe nodded towards a place that had evidently been occupied. The rest\r\nwere all expectant.\r\n\r\n“Oh, what’s-his-name.”\r\n\r\n“Fat Iky?”\r\n\r\nBundle and her father had enough sympathy between them to comprehend\r\neach other’s somewhat misleading observations.\r\n\r\n“That’s it.”\r\n\r\n“Did I see you talking to the detective this morning before breakfast?”\r\n\r\nLord Caterham sighed.\r\n\r\n“Yes, he buttonholed me in the hall. I do think the hours before\r\nbreakfast should be sacred. I shall have to go abroad. The strain on my\r\nnerves——”\r\n\r\nBundle interrupted unceremoniously.\r\n\r\n“What did he say?”\r\n\r\n“Said every one who wanted to could clear out.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Bundle, “that’s all right. That’s what you’ve been\r\nwanting.”\r\n\r\n“I know. But he didn’t leave it at that. He went on to say that\r\nnevertheless he wanted me to ask every one to stay on.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand,” said Bundle, wrinkling her nose.\r\n\r\n“So confusing and contradictory,” complained Lord Caterham. “And before\r\nbreakfast too.”\r\n\r\n“What did you say?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I agreed, of course. It’s never any good arguing with these\r\npeople. Especially before breakfast,” continued Lord Caterham,\r\nreverting to his principal grievance.\r\n\r\n“Who have you asked so far?”\r\n\r\n“Cade. He was up very early this morning. He’s going to stop on. I\r\ndon’t mind that. I can’t quite make the fellow out; but I like him—I\r\nlike him very much.”\r\n\r\n“So does Virginia,” said Bundle, drawing a pattern on the table with\r\nher fork.\r\n\r\n“Eh?”\r\n\r\n“And so do I. But that doesn’t seem to matter.”\r\n\r\n“And I asked Isaacstein,” continued Lord Caterham.\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“But fortunately he’s got to go back to town. Don’t forget to order the\r\ncar for the 10.40, by the way.”\r\n\r\n“All right.”\r\n\r\n“Now if I can only get rid of Fish too,” continued Lord Caterham, his\r\nspirits rising.\r\n\r\n“I thought you liked talking to him about your mouldy old books.”\r\n\r\n“So I do, so I do. So I did, rather. But it gets monotonous when\r\none finds that one is always doing all the talking. Fish is very\r\ninterested, but he never volunteers any statements of his own.”\r\n\r\n“It’s better than doing all the listening,” said Bundle. “Like one does\r\nwith George Lomax.”\r\n\r\nLord Caterham shuddered at the remembrance.\r\n\r\n“George is all very well on platforms,” said Bundle. “I’ve clapped\r\nhim myself, though of course I know all the time that he’s talking\r\nbalderdash. And anyway I’m a Socialist——”\r\n\r\n“I know, my dear, I know,” said Lord Caterham hastily.\r\n\r\n“It’s all right,” said Bundle. “I’m not going to bring politics into\r\nthe house. That’s what George does—public speaking in private life. It\r\nought to be abolished by Act of Parliament.”\r\n\r\n“Quite so,” said Lord Caterham.\r\n\r\n“What about Virginia?” asked Bundle. “Is she to be asked to stop on?”\r\n\r\n“Battle said everybody.”\r\n\r\n“Says he firmly! Have you asked her to be my stepma yet?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think it would be any good,” said Lord Caterham mournfully.\r\n“Although she did call me a darling last night. But that’s the worst of\r\nthese attractive young women with affectionate dispositions. They’ll\r\nsay anything, and they mean absolutely nothing by it.”\r\n\r\n“No,” agreed Bundle. “It would have been much more hopeful if she’d\r\nthrown a boot at you or tried to bite you.”\r\n\r\n“You modern young people seem to have such unpleasant ideas about\r\nlove-making,” said Lord Caterham plaintively.\r\n\r\n“It comes from reading _The Sheik_,” said Bundle. “Desert love. Throw\r\nher about, etc.”\r\n\r\n“What is _The Sheik_?” asked Lord Caterham simply. “Is it a poem?”\r\n\r\nBundle looked at him with commiserating pity. Then she rose and kissed\r\nthe top of his head.\r\n\r\n“Dear old Daddy,” she remarked, and sprang lightly out of the window.\r\n\r\nLord Caterham went back to the Sale Rooms.\r\n\r\nHe jumped when addressed suddenly by Mr. Hiram Fish, who had made his\r\nusual noiseless entry.\r\n\r\n“Good morning, Lord Caterham.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, good morning,” said Lord Caterham. “Good morning. Nice day.”\r\n\r\n“The weather is delightful,” said Mr. Fish.\r\n\r\nHe helped himself to coffee. By way of food, he took a piece of dry\r\ntoast.\r\n\r\n“Do I hear correctly that the embargo is removed?” he asked after a\r\nminute or two. “That we are all free to depart?”\r\n\r\n“Yes—er—yes,” said Lord Caterham. “As a matter of fact, I hoped, I\r\nmean that I shall be delighted”—his conscience drove him on—“only too\r\ndelighted if you will stay on for a little.”\r\n\r\n“Why, Lord Caterham——”\r\n\r\n“It’s been a beastly visit, I know,” Lord Caterham hurried on. “Too\r\nbad. Shan’t blame you for wanting to run away.”\r\n\r\n“You misjudge me, Lord Caterham. The associations have been painful,\r\nno one could deny that point. But the English country life, as lived\r\nin the mansions of the great, has a powerful attraction for me. I am\r\ninterested in the study of those conditions. It is a thing we lack\r\ncompletely in America. I shall be only too delighted to accept your\r\nvurry kind invitation and stay on.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, well,” said Lord Caterham, “that’s that. Absolutely delighted, my\r\ndear fellow, absolutely delighted.”\r\n\r\nSpurring himself on to a false geniality of manner, Lord Caterham\r\nmurmured something about having to see his bailiff and escaped from the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nIn the hall, he saw Virginia just descending the staircase.\r\n\r\n“Shall I take you into breakfast?” asked Lord Caterham tenderly.\r\n\r\n“I’ve had it in bed, thank you. I was frightfully sleepy this morning.”\r\n\r\nShe yawned.\r\n\r\n“Had a bad night, perhaps?”\r\n\r\n“Not exactly a bad night. From one point of view decidedly a good\r\nnight. Oh, Lord Caterham”—she slipped her hand inside his arm and\r\ngave it a squeeze—“I _am_ enjoying myself. You were a darling to ask\r\nme down.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll stop on for a bit, then, won’t you? Battle is lifting the—the\r\nembargo, but I want you to stay particularly. So does Bundle.”\r\n\r\n“Of course I’ll stay. It’s sweet of you to ask me.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Lord Caterham.\r\n\r\nHe sighed.\r\n\r\n“What is your secret sorrow?” asked Virginia. “Has anyone bitten you?”\r\n\r\n“That’s just it,” said Lord Caterham mournfully.\r\n\r\nVirginia looked puzzled.\r\n\r\n“You don’t feel, by any chance, that you want to throw a boot at me?\r\nNo, I can see you don’t. Oh, well, it’s of no consequence.”\r\n\r\nLord Caterham drifted sadly away, and Virginia passed out through a\r\nside door into the garden.\r\n\r\nShe stood there for a moment, breathing in the crisp October air which\r\nwas infinitely refreshing to one in her slightly jaded state.\r\n\r\nShe started a little to find Superintendent Battle at her elbow. The\r\nman seemed to have an extraordinary knack of appearing out of space\r\nwithout the least warning.\r\n\r\n“Good morning, Mrs. Revel. Not too tired, I hope?”\r\n\r\nVirginia shook her head.\r\n\r\n“It was a most exciting night,” she said. “Well worth the loss of a\r\nlittle sleep. The only thing is, to-day seems a little dull after it.”\r\n\r\n“There’s a nice shady place down under that cedar tree,” remarked the\r\nsuperintendent. “Shall I take a chair down to it for you?”\r\n\r\n“If you think it’s the best thing for me to do,” said Virginia solemnly.\r\n\r\n“You’re very quick, Mrs. Revel. Yes, it’s quite true, I do want a word\r\nwith you.”\r\n\r\nHe picked up a long wicker chair and carried it down the lawn. Virginia\r\nfollowed him with a cushion under her arm.\r\n\r\n“Very dangerous place, that terrace,” remarked the detective. “That is,\r\nif you want to have a private conversation.”\r\n\r\n“I’m getting excited again, Superintendent Battle.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, it’s nothing important.” He took out a big watch and glanced at\r\nit. “Half-past ten. I’m starting for Wyvvern Abbey in ten minutes to\r\nreport to Mr. Lomax. Plenty of time. I only wanted to know if you could\r\ntell me a little more about Mr. Cade.”\r\n\r\n“About Mr. Cade?”\r\n\r\nVirginia was startled.\r\n\r\n“Yes, where you first met him, and how long you’ve known him and so\r\nforth.”\r\n\r\nBattle’s manner was easy and pleasant enough. He even refrained from\r\nlooking at her, and the fact that he did so made her vaguely uneasy.\r\n\r\n“It’s more difficult than you think,” she said at last. “He did me a\r\ngreat service once——”\r\n\r\nBattle interrupted her.\r\n\r\n“Before you go any further, Mrs. Revel, I’d just like to say something.\r\nLast night, after you and Mr. Eversleigh had gone to bed, Mr. Cade told\r\nme all about the letters and the man who was killed in your house.”\r\n\r\n“He did?” gasped Virginia.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and very wisely too. It clears up a lot of misunderstanding.\r\nThere’s only one thing he didn’t tell me—how long he had known you.\r\nNow I’ve a little idea of my own about that. You shall tell me if I’m\r\nright or wrong. I think that the day he came to your house in Pont\r\nStreet was the first time you had ever seen him. Ah! I see I’m right.\r\nIt was so.”\r\n\r\nVirginia said nothing. For the first time she felt afraid of this\r\nstolid man with the expressionless face. She understood what Anthony\r\nhad meant when he said there were no flies on Superintendent Battle.\r\n\r\n“Has he ever told you anything about his life?” the detective\r\ncontinued. “Before he was in South Africa, I mean. Canada? Or before\r\nthat, the Sudan? Or about his boyhood?”\r\n\r\nVirginia merely shook her head.\r\n\r\n“And yet I’d bet he’s got something worth telling. You can’t mistake\r\nthe face of a man who’s led a life of daring and adventure. He could\r\ntell you some interesting tales if he cared to.”\r\n\r\n“If you want to know about his past life, why don’t you cable to that\r\nfriend of his, Mr. McGrath?” Virginia asked.\r\n\r\n“Oh, we have. But it seems he’s up country somewhere. Still, there’s no\r\ndoubt Mr. Cade was in Bulawayo when he said he was. But I wondered what\r\nhe’d been doing before he came to South Africa. He’d only had that job\r\nwith Castle’s about a month.” He took out his watch again. “I must be\r\noff. The car will be waiting.”\r\n\r\nVirginia watched him retreat to the house. But she did not move from\r\nher chair. She hoped that Anthony might appear and join her. Instead\r\ncame Bill Eversleigh, with a prodigious yawn.\r\n\r\n“Thank God, I’ve got a chance to speak to you at last, Virginia,” he\r\ncomplained.\r\n\r\n“Well, speak to me very gently, Bill darling, or I shall burst into\r\ntears.”\r\n\r\n“Has some one been bullying you?”\r\n\r\n“Not exactly bullying me. Getting inside my mind and turning it inside\r\nout. I feel as though I’d been jumped on by an elephant.”\r\n\r\n“Not Battle?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Battle. He’s a terrible man really.”\r\n\r\n“Well, never mind Battle. I say, Virginia, I do love you so awfully——”\r\n\r\n“Not this morning, Bill. I’m not strong enough. Anyway, I’ve always\r\ntold you the best people don’t propose before lunch.”\r\n\r\n“Good Lord,” said Bill. “I could propose to you before breakfast.”\r\n\r\nVirginia shuddered.\r\n\r\n“Bill, be sensible and intelligent for a minute. I want to ask your\r\nadvice.”\r\n\r\n“If you’d once make up your mind to it, and say you’d marry me, you’d\r\nfeel miles better, I’m sure. Happier, you know, and more settled down.”\r\n\r\n“Listen to me, Bill. Proposing to me is your _idée fixe_. All men\r\npropose when they’re bored and can’t think of anything to say. Remember\r\nmy age and my widowed state, and go and make love to a pure young girl.”\r\n\r\n“My darling Virginia—Oh, blast! here’s that French idiot bearing down\r\non us.”\r\n\r\nIt was indeed M. Lemoine, black-bearded and correct of demeanour as\r\never.\r\n\r\n“Good morning, madame. You are not fatigued, I trust?”\r\n\r\n“Not in the least.”\r\n\r\n“That is excellent. Good morning, Mr. Eversleigh.”\r\n\r\n“How would it be if we promenaded ourselves a little, the three of us?”\r\nsuggested the Frenchman.\r\n\r\n“How about it, Bill?” said Virginia.\r\n\r\n“Oh, all right,” said the unwilling young gentleman by her side.\r\n\r\nHe heaved himself up from the grass, and the three of them walked\r\nslowly along. Virginia between the two men. She was sensible at once of\r\na strange undercurrent of excitement in the Frenchman, though she had\r\nno clue as to what caused it.\r\n\r\nSoon, with her usual skill, she was putting him at his ease, asking him\r\nquestions, listening to his answers, and gradually drawing him out.\r\nPresently he was telling them anecdotes of the famous King Victor. He\r\ntalked well, albeit with a certain bitterness, as he described the\r\nvarious ways in which the detective bureau had been outwitted.\r\n\r\nBut all the time, despite the real absorption of Lemoine in his own\r\nnarrative, Virginia had a feeling that he had some other object in\r\nview. Moreover, she judged that Lemoine, under cover of his story, was\r\ndeliberately striking out his own course across the park. They were\r\nnot just strolling idly. He was deliberately guiding them in a certain\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, he broke off his story and looked round. They were\r\nstanding just where the drive intersected the park before turning an\r\nabrupt corner by a clump of trees. Lemoine was staring at a vehicle\r\napproaching them from the direction of the house.\r\n\r\nVirginia’s eyes followed his.\r\n\r\n“It’s the luggage cart,” she said, “taking Isaacstein’s luggage and his\r\nvalet to the station.”\r\n\r\n“Is that so?” said Lemoine. He glanced down at his own watch and\r\nstarted. “A thousand pardons. I have been longer here than I\r\nmeant—such charming company. Is it possible, do you think, that I\r\nmight have a lift to the village?”\r\n\r\nHe stepped out on to the drive, and signalled with his arm. The luggage\r\ncart stopped, and after a word or two of explanation Lemoine climbed in\r\nbehind. He raised his hat politely to Virginia, and drove off.\r\n\r\nThe other two stood and watched the cart disappearing with puzzled\r\nexpressions. Just as the cart swung round the bend, a suit-case fell\r\noff into the drive. The cart went on.\r\n\r\n“Come on,” said Virginia to Bill. “We’re going to see something\r\ninteresting. That suit-case was thrown out.”\r\n\r\n“Nobody’s noticed it,” said Bill.\r\n\r\nThey ran down the drive towards the fallen piece of luggage. Just as\r\nthey reached it, Lemoine came round the corner of the bend on foot. He\r\nwas hot from walking fast.\r\n\r\n“I was obliged to descend,” he said pleasantly. “I found that I had\r\nleft something behind.”\r\n\r\n“This?” said Bill, indicating the suit-case.\r\n\r\nIt was a handsome case of heavy pigskin, with the initials H. I. on it.\r\n\r\n“What a pity!” said Lemoine gently. “It must have fallen out. Shall we\r\nlift it from the road?”\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for a reply, he picked up the suit-case, and carried it\r\nover to the belt of trees. He stooped over it, something flashed in his\r\nhand, and the lock slipped back.\r\n\r\nHe spoke, and his voice was totally different, quick and commanding.\r\n\r\n“The car will be here in a minute,” he said. “Is it in sight?”\r\n\r\nVirginia looked back towards the house.\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Good.”\r\n\r\nWith deft fingers he tossed the things out of the suit-case.\r\nGold-topped bottle, silk pyjamas, a variety of socks. Suddenly his\r\nwhole figure stiffened. He caught up what appeared to be a bundle of\r\nsilk underwear, and unrolled it rapidly.\r\n\r\nA slight exclamation broke from Bill. In the centre of the bundle was a\r\nheavy revolver.\r\n\r\n“I hear the horn,” said Virginia.\r\n\r\nLike lightning, Lemoine repacked the suit-case. The revolver he wrapped\r\nin a silk handkerchief of his own, and slipped into his pocket. He\r\nsnapped the locks of the suit-case, and turned quickly to Bill.\r\n\r\n“Take it. Madame will be with you. Stop the car, and explain that it\r\nfell off the luggage cart. Do not mention me.”\r\n\r\nBill stepped quickly down to the drive just as the big Lanchester\r\nlimousine with Isaacstein inside it came round the corner. The\r\nchauffeur slowed down, and Bill swung the suit-case up to him.\r\n\r\n“Fell off the luggage cart,” he explained. “We happened to see it.”\r\n\r\nHe caught a momentary glimpse of a startled yellow face as the\r\nfinancier stared at him, and then the car swept on again.\r\n\r\nThey went back to Lemoine. He was standing with the revolver in his\r\nhand, and a look of gloating satisfaction in his face.\r\n\r\n“A long shot,” he said. “A very long shot. But it came off.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n22\r\n\r\nThe Red Signal\r\n\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Battle was standing in the library at Wyvvern Abbey.\r\n\r\nGeorge Lomax, seated before a desk overflowing with papers, was\r\nfrowning portentously.\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Battle had opened proceedings by making a brief and\r\nbusiness-like report. Since then, the conversation had lain almost\r\nentirely with George, and Battle had contented himself with making\r\nbrief and usually monosyllabic replies to the other’s questions.\r\n\r\nOn the desk, in front of George, was the packet of letters Anthony had\r\nfound on his dressing-table.\r\n\r\n“I can’t understand it at all,” said George irritably, as he picked up\r\nthe packet. “They’re in code, you say?”\r\n\r\n“Just so, Mr. Lomax.”\r\n\r\n“And where does he say he found them—on his dressing-table?”\r\n\r\nBattle repeated, word for word, Anthony Cade’s account of how he had\r\ncome to regain possession of the letters.\r\n\r\n“And he brought them at once to you? That was quite proper—quite\r\nproper. But who could have placed them in his room?”\r\n\r\nBattle shook his head.\r\n\r\n“That’s the sort of thing you ought to know,” complained George. “It\r\nsounds to me very fishy—very fishy indeed. What do we know about this\r\nman Cade anyway? He appears in a most mysterious manner—under highly\r\nsuspicious circumstances—and we know nothing whatever about him. I\r\nmay say that I, personally, don’t care for his manner at all. You’ve\r\nmade inquiries about him, I suppose?”\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Battle permitted himself a patient smile.\r\n\r\n“We wired at once to South Africa, and his story has been confirmed on\r\nall points. He was in Bulawayo with Mr. McGrath at the time he stated.\r\nPrevious to their meeting, he was employed by Messrs. Castle, the\r\nTourist Agents.”\r\n\r\n“Just what I should have expected,” said George. “He has the kind of\r\ncheap assurance that succeeds in a certain type of employment. But\r\nabout these letters—steps must be taken at once—at once——”\r\n\r\nThe great man puffed himself out and swelled importantly.\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Battle opened his mouth, but George forestalled him.\r\n\r\n“There must be no delay. These letters must be decoded without any loss\r\nof time. Let me see, who is the man? There is a man—connected with\r\nthe British Museum. Knows all there is to know about ciphers. Ran the\r\ndepartment for us during the War. Where is Miss Oscar? She will know.\r\nName something like Win—Win——”\r\n\r\n“Professor Wynward,” said Battle.\r\n\r\n“Exactly. I remember perfectly now. He must be wired to, immediately.”\r\n\r\n“I have done so, Mr. Lomax, an hour ago. He will arrive by the 12.10.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, very good, very good. Thank Heaven, something is off my mind.\r\nI shall have to be in town to-day. You can get along without me, I\r\nsuppose?”\r\n\r\n“I think so, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Well, do your best, Battle, do your best. I am terribly rushed just at\r\npresent.”\r\n\r\n“Just so, sir.”\r\n\r\n“By the way, why did not Mr. Eversleigh come over with you?”\r\n\r\n“He was still asleep, sir. We’ve been up all night, as I told you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, quite so. I am frequently up nearly the whole night myself. To do\r\nthe work of thirty-six hours in twenty-four, that is my constant task!\r\nSend Mr. Eversleigh over at once when you get back, will you, Battle?”\r\n\r\n“I will give him your message, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Battle. I realize perfectly that you had to repose a\r\ncertain amount of confidence in him. But do you think it was strictly\r\nnecessary to take my cousin, Mrs. Revel, into your confidence also?”\r\n\r\n“In view of the name signed to those letters, I do, Mr. Lomax.”\r\n\r\n“An amazing piece of effrontery,” murmured George, his brow darkened\r\nas he looked at the bundle of letters. “I remember the late King of\r\nHerzoslovakia. A charming fellow, but weak—deplorably weak. A tool in\r\nthe hands of an unscrupulous woman. Have you any theory as to how these\r\nletters came to be restored to Mr. Cade?”\r\n\r\n“It’s my opinion,” said Battle, “that if people can’t get a thing one\r\nway—they try another.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t quite follow you,” said George.\r\n\r\n“This crook, this King Victor, he’s well aware by now that the Council\r\nChamber is watched. So he’ll let us have the letters, and let us do\r\nthe decoding, and let us find the hiding-place. And then—trouble! But\r\nLemoine and I between us will attend to that.”\r\n\r\n“You’ve got a plan, eh?”\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t go so far as to say I’ve got a plan. But I’ve got an idea.\r\nIt’s a very useful thing sometimes, an idea.”\r\n\r\nThereupon Superintendent Battle took his departure.\r\n\r\nHe had no intention of taking George any further into his confidence.\r\n\r\nOn the way back, he passed Anthony on the road and stopped.\r\n\r\n“Going to give me a lift back to the house?” asked Anthony. “That’s\r\ngood.”\r\n\r\n“Where have you been, Mr. Cade?”\r\n\r\n“Down to the station to inquire about trains.”\r\n\r\nBattle raised his eyebrows.\r\n\r\n“Thinking of leaving us again?” he inquired.\r\n\r\n“Not just at present,” laughed Anthony. “By the way what’s upset\r\nIsaacstein? He arrived in the car just as I left, and he looked as\r\nthough something had given him a nasty jolt.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Isaacstein?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t say, I’m sure. I fancy it would take a good deal to jolt him.”\r\n\r\n“So do I,” agreed Anthony. “He’s quite one of the strong silent yellow\r\nmen of finance.”\r\n\r\nSuddenly Battle leant forward and touched the chauffeur on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Stop, will you? And wait for me here.”\r\n\r\nHe jumped out of the car, much to Anthony’s surprise. But in a minute\r\nor two, the latter perceived M. Lemoine advancing to meet the English\r\ndetective, and gathered that it was a signal from him which had\r\nattracted Battle’s attention.\r\n\r\nThere was a rapid colloquy between them, and then the superintendent\r\nreturned to the car and jumped in again, biding the chauffeur drive on.\r\n\r\nHis expression had completely changed.\r\n\r\n“They’ve found the revolver,” he said suddenly and curtly.\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\nAnthony gazed at him in great surprise.\r\n\r\n“Where?”\r\n\r\n“In Isaacstein’s suit-case.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, impossible!”\r\n\r\n“Nothing’s impossible,” said Battle. “I ought to have remembered that.”\r\n\r\nHe sat perfectly still, tapping his knee with his hand.\r\n\r\n“Who found it?”\r\n\r\nBattle jerked his head over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Lemoine. Clever chap. They think no end of him at the Sûreté.”\r\n\r\n“But doesn’t this upset all your ideas?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Superintendent Battle very slowly. “I can’t say it does. It\r\nwas a bit of a surprise, I admit, at first. But it fits in very well\r\nwith one idea of mine.”\r\n\r\n“Which is?”\r\n\r\nBut the superintendent branched off on to a totally different subject.\r\n\r\n“I wonder if you’d mind finding Mr. Eversleigh for me, sir? There’s a\r\nmessage for him from Mr. Lomax. He’s to go over to the Abbey at once.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” said Anthony. The car had just drawn up at the great door.\r\n“He’s probably in bed still.”\r\n\r\n“I think not,” said the detective. “If you’ll look, you’ll see him\r\nwalking under the trees with Mrs. Revel.”\r\n\r\n“Wonderful eyes you have, haven’t you, Battle?” said Anthony as he\r\ndeparted on his errand.\r\n\r\nHe delivered the message to Bill, who was duly disgusted.\r\n\r\n“Damn it all,” grumbled Bill to himself, as he strode off to the house,\r\n“why can’t Codders sometimes leave me alone? And why can’t these\r\nblasted Colonials stay in their Colonies? What do they want to come\r\nover here for, and pick out all the best girls? I’m fed to the teeth\r\nwith everything.”\r\n\r\n“Have you heard about the revolver?” asked Virginia breathlessly, as\r\nBill left them.\r\n\r\n“Battle told me. Rather staggering, isn’t it? Isaacstein was in a\r\nfrightful state yesterday to get away, but I thought it was just\r\nnerves. He’s about the one person I’d have pitched upon as being above\r\nsuspicion. Can you see any motive for his wanting Prince Michael out of\r\nthe way?”\r\n\r\n“It certainly doesn’t fit in,” agreed Virginia thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“Nothing fits in anywhere,” said Anthony discontentedly. “I rather\r\nfancied myself as an amateur detective to begin with, and so far all\r\nI’ve done is to clear the character of the French governess at vast\r\ntrouble and some little expense.”\r\n\r\n“Is that what you went to France for?” inquired Virginia.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I went to Dinard and had an interview with the Comtesse de\r\nBreteuil, awfully pleased with my own cleverness, and fully expecting\r\nto be told that no such person as Mademoiselle Brun had ever been\r\nheard of. Instead of which I was given to understand that the lady in\r\nquestion had been the mainstay of the household for the last seven\r\nyears. So, unless the Comtesse is also a crook, that ingenious theory\r\nof mine falls to the ground.”\r\n\r\nVirginia shook her head.\r\n\r\n“Madame de Breteuil is quite above suspicion. I know her quite well,\r\nand I fancy I must have come across Mademoiselle at the chateau. I\r\ncertainly know her face quite well—in that vague way one does know\r\ngovernesses and companions and people one sits opposite to in trains.\r\nIt’s awful, but I never really look at them properly. Do you?”\r\n\r\n“Only if they’re exceptionally beautiful,” admitted Anthony.\r\n\r\n“Well, in this case——” she broke off. “What’s the matter?”\r\n\r\nAnthony was staring at a figure which detached itself from the clump of\r\ntrees and stood there rigidly at attention. It was the Herzoslovakian,\r\nBoris.\r\n\r\n“Excuse me,” said Anthony to Virginia, “I must just speak to my dog a\r\nminute.”\r\n\r\nHe went across to where Boris was standing.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter? What do you want?”\r\n\r\n“Master,” said Boris, bowing.\r\n\r\n“Yes, that’s all very well, but you mustn’t keep following me about\r\nlike this. It looks odd.”\r\n\r\nWithout a word, Boris produced a soiled scrap of paper, evidently torn\r\nfrom a letter, and handed it to Anthony.\r\n\r\n“What’s this?” said Anthony.\r\n\r\nThere was an address scrawled on the paper, nothing else.\r\n\r\n“He dropped it,” said Boris. “I bring it to the Master.”\r\n\r\n“Who dropped it?”\r\n\r\n“The foreign gentleman.”\r\n\r\n“But why bring it to me?”\r\n\r\nBoris looked at him reproachfully.\r\n\r\n“Well, anyway, go away now,” said Anthony. “I’m busy.”\r\n\r\nBoris saluted, turned sharply on his heel, and marched away. Anthony\r\nrejoined Virginia, thrusting the piece of paper into his pocket.\r\n\r\n“What did he want?” she asked curiously. “And why do you call him your\r\ndog?”\r\n\r\n“Because he acts like one,” said Anthony, answering the last question\r\nfirst. “He must have been a retriever in his last incarnation, I think.\r\nHe’s just brought me a piece of a letter which he says the foreign\r\ngentleman dropped. I suppose he means Lemoine.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose so,” acquiesced Virginia.\r\n\r\n“He’s always following me round,” continued Anthony. “Just like a dog.\r\nSays next to nothing. Just looks at me with his big round eyes. I can’t\r\nmake him out.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps he meant Isaacstein,” suggested Virginia. “Isaacstein looks\r\nforeign enough, Heaven knows.”\r\n\r\n“Isaacstein,” muttered Anthony impatiently. “Where the devil does he\r\ncome in?”\r\n\r\n“Are you ever sorry that you’ve mixed yourself up in all this?” asked\r\nVirginia suddenly.\r\n\r\n“Sorry? Good Lord, no. I love it. I’ve spent most of my life looking\r\nfor trouble, you know. Perhaps, this time, I’ve got a little more than\r\nI bargained for.”\r\n\r\n“But you’re well out of the wood now,” said Virginia, a little\r\nsurprised by the unusual gravity of his tone.\r\n\r\n“Not quite.”\r\n\r\nThey strolled on for a minute or two in silence.\r\n\r\n“There are some people,” said Anthony, breaking the silence, “who\r\ndon’t conform to the signals. An ordinary well-regulated locomotive\r\nslows down or pulls up when it sees the red light hoisted against it.\r\nPerhaps I was born colour blind. When I see the red signal—I can’t\r\nhelp forging ahead. And in the end, you know, that spells disaster.\r\nBound to. And quite right really. That sort of thing is bad for traffic\r\ngenerally.”\r\n\r\nHe still spoke very seriously.\r\n\r\n“I suppose,” said Virginia, “that you have taken a good many risks in\r\nyour life?”\r\n\r\n“Pretty nearly every one there is—except marriage.”\r\n\r\n“That’s rather cynical.”\r\n\r\n“It wasn’t meant to be. Marriage, the kind of marriage I mean, would be\r\nthe biggest adventure of the lot.”\r\n\r\n“I like that,” said Virginia, flushing eagerly.\r\n\r\n“There’s only one kind of woman I’d want to marry—the kind who is\r\nworlds removed from my type of life. What would we do about it? Is she\r\nto lead my life, or am I to lead hers?”\r\n\r\n“If she loved you——”\r\n\r\n“Sentimentality, Mrs. Revel. You know it is. Love isn’t a drug that\r\nyou take to blind you to your surroundings—you can make it that, yes,\r\nbut it’s a pity—love can be a lot more than that. What do you think\r\nthe King and his beggar maid thought of married life after they’d been\r\nmarried a year or two? Didn’t she regret her rags and her bare feet\r\nand her care-free life? You bet she did. Would it have been any good\r\nrenouncing his Crown for her sake? Not a bit of good, either. He’d have\r\nmade a damned bad beggar, I’m sure. And no woman respects a man when\r\nhe’s doing a thing thoroughly badly.”\r\n\r\n“Have you fallen in love with a beggar maid, Mr. Cade?” inquired\r\nVirginia softly.\r\n\r\n“It’s the other way about with me, but the principle’s the same.”\r\n\r\n“And there’s no way out?” asked Virginia.\r\n\r\n“There’s always a way out,” said Anthony gloomily. “I’ve a theory that\r\none can always get anything one wants if one will pay the price. And\r\ndo you know what the price is, nine times out of ten? Compromise. A\r\nbeastly thing, compromise, but it steals upon you as you near middle\r\nage. It’s stealing upon me now. To get the woman I want I’d—I’d even\r\ntake up regular work.”\r\n\r\nVirginia laughed.\r\n\r\n“I was brought up to a trade, you know,” continued Anthony.\r\n\r\n“And you abandoned it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“A matter of principle.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!”\r\n\r\n“You’re a very unusual woman,” said Anthony suddenly, turning and\r\nlooking at her.\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“You can refrain from asking questions.”\r\n\r\n“You mean that I haven’t asked you what your trade was?”\r\n\r\n“Just that.”\r\n\r\nAgain they walked on in silence. They were nearing the house now,\r\npassing close by the scented sweetness of the rose garden.\r\n\r\n“You understand well enough, I dare say,” said Anthony, breaking the\r\nsilence. “You know when a man’s in love with you. I don’t suppose you\r\ncare a hang for me—or for anyone else—but, by God, I’d like to make\r\nyou care.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think you could?” asked Virginia, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n“Probably not, but I’d have a damned good try.”\r\n\r\n“Are you sorry you ever met me?” she said suddenly.\r\n\r\n“Lord no. It’s the red signal again. When I first saw you—that day\r\nin Pont Street, I knew I was up against something that was going to\r\nhurt like fun. Your face did that to me—just your face. There’s magic\r\nin you from head to foot—some women are like that, but I’ve never\r\nknown a woman who had so much of it as you have. You’ll marry some\r\none respectable and prosperous, I suppose, and I shall return to my\r\ndisreputable life, but I’ll kiss you once before I go—I swear I will.”\r\n\r\n“You can’t do it now,” said Virginia softly. “Superintendent Battle is\r\nwatching us out of the library window.”\r\n\r\nAnthony looked at her.\r\n\r\n“You’re rather a devil, Virginia,” he said dispassionately. “But rather\r\na dear too.”\r\n\r\nThen he waved his hand airily to Superintendent Battle.\r\n\r\n“Caught any criminals this morning, Battle?”\r\n\r\n“Not as yet, Mr. Cade.”\r\n\r\n“That sounds hopeful.”\r\n\r\nBattle, with an agility surprising in so stolid a man, vaulted out of\r\nthe library window and joined them on the terrace.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got Professor Wynward down here,” he announced in a whisper.\r\n“Just this minute arrived. He’s decoding the letters now. Would you\r\nlike to see him at work?”\r\n\r\nHis tone suggested that of the showman speaking of some pet exhibit.\r\nReceiving a reply in the affirmative, he led them up to the window and\r\ninvited them to peep inside.\r\n\r\nSeated at a table, the letters spread out in front of him and writing\r\nbusily on a big sheet of paper was a small red-haired man of middle\r\nage. He grunted irritably to himself as he wrote, and every now and\r\nthen rubbed his nose violently until its hue almost rivalled that of\r\nhis hair.\r\n\r\nPresently he looked up.\r\n\r\n“That you, Battle? What you want me down here to unravel this\r\ntomfoolery for? A child in arms could do it. A baby of two could do it\r\non its head. Call this thing a cipher? It leaps to the eye, man.”\r\n\r\n“I’m glad of that, Professor,” said Battle mildly. “But we’re not all\r\nso clever as you are, you know.”\r\n\r\n“It doesn’t need cleverness,” snapped the Professor. “It’s routine\r\nwork. Do you want the whole bundle done? It’s a long business, you\r\nknow—requires diligent application and close attention, and absolutely\r\nno intelligence. I’ve done the one dated ‘Chimneys’ which you said was\r\nimportant. I might as well take the rest back to London and hand ’em\r\nover to one of my assistants. I really can’t afford the time myself.\r\nI’ve come away now from a real teaser, and I want to get back to it.”\r\n\r\nHis eyes glistened a little.\r\n\r\n“Very well, Professor,” assented Battle. “I’m sorry we’re such small\r\nfry. I’ll explain to Mr. Lomax. It’s just this one letter that all the\r\nhurry is about. Lord Caterham is expecting you to stay for lunch, I\r\nbelieve.”\r\n\r\n“Never have lunch,” said the Professor. “Bad habit, lunch. A banana\r\nand a water biscuit is all any sane and healthy man should need in the\r\nmiddle of the day.”\r\n\r\nHe seized his overcoat, which lay across the back of a chair. Battle\r\nwent round to the front of the house, and a few minutes later Anthony\r\nand Virginia heard the sound of a car driving away.\r\n\r\nBattle rejoined them, carrying in his hand the half-sheet of paper\r\nwhich the Professor had given him.\r\n\r\n“He’s always like that,” said Battle, referring to the departed\r\nProfessor. “In the very deuce of a hurry. Clever man, though. Well,\r\nhere’s the kernel of Her Majesty’s letter. Care to have a look at it?”\r\n\r\nVirginia stretched out a hand, and Anthony read it over her shoulder.\r\nIt had been, he remembered, a long epistle, breathing mingled passion\r\nand despair. The genius of Professor Wynward had transformed it into an\r\nessentially business-like communication.\r\n\r\n_Operations carried out successfully, but S. double crossed us. Has\r\nremoved stone from hiding-place. Not in his room. I have searched.\r\nFound following memorandum which I think refers to it_: “RICHMOND SEVEN\r\nSTRAIGHT EIGHT LEFT THREE RIGHT.”\r\n\r\n“S.?” said Anthony. “Stylptitch, of course. Cunning old dog. He changed\r\nthe hiding-place.”\r\n\r\n“Richmond,” said Virginia thoughtfully. “Is the diamond concealed\r\nsomewhere at Richmond, I wonder?”\r\n\r\n“It’s a favourite spot for Royalties,” agreed Anthony.\r\n\r\nBattle shook his head.\r\n\r\n“I still think it’s a reference to something in this house.”\r\n\r\n“I know,” cried Virginia suddenly.\r\n\r\nBoth men turned to look at her.\r\n\r\n“The Holbein portrait in the Council Chamber. They were tapping on the\r\nwall just below it. And it’s a portrait of the Earl of Richmond!”\r\n\r\n“You’ve got it,” said Battle, and slapped his leg.\r\n\r\nHe spoke with an animation quite unwonted.\r\n\r\n“That’s the starting-point, the picture, and the crooks know no more\r\nthan we do what the figures refer to. Those two men in armour stand\r\ndirectly underneath the picture, and their first idea was that the\r\ndiamond was hidden in one of them. The measurements might have been\r\ninches. That failed, and their next idea was a secret passage or\r\nstairway, or a sliding panel. Do you know of any such thing, Mrs.\r\nRevel?”\r\n\r\nVirginia shook her head.\r\n\r\n“There’s a Priest’s Hole, and at least one secret passage, I know,” she\r\nsaid. “I believe I’ve been shown them once, but I can’t remember much\r\nabout them now. Here’s Bundle, she’ll know.”\r\n\r\nBundle was coming quickly along the terrace towards them.\r\n\r\n“I’m taking the Panhard up to town after lunch,” she remarked. “Anyone\r\nwant a lift? Wouldn’t you like to come, Mr. Cade? We’ll be back by\r\ndinner-time.”\r\n\r\n“No, thanks,” said Anthony. “I’m quite happy and busy down here.”\r\n\r\n“The man fears me,” said Bundle. “Either my driving or my fatal\r\nfascination! Which is it?”\r\n\r\n“The latter,” said Anthony. “Every time.”\r\n\r\n“Bundle, dear,” said Virginia, “is there any secret passage leading out\r\nof the Council Chamber?”\r\n\r\n“Rather. But it’s only a mouldy one. Supposed to lead from Chimneys to\r\nWyvvern Abbey. So it did in the old, old days, but it’s all blocked up\r\nnow. You can only get along it for about a hundred yards from this end.\r\nThe one upstairs in the White Gallery is ever so much more amusing, and\r\nthe Priest’s Hole isn’t half bad.”\r\n\r\n“We’re not regarding them from an artistic standpoint,” explained\r\nVirginia. “It’s business. How do you get into the Council Chamber one?”\r\n\r\n“Hinged panel. I’ll show you after lunch if you like.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” said Superintendent Battle. “Shall we say at 2.30?”\r\n\r\nBundle looked at him with lifted eyebrows.\r\n\r\n“Crook stuff?” she inquired.\r\n\r\nTredwell appeared on the terrace.\r\n\r\n“Luncheon is served, my lady,” he announced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n23\r\n\r\nEncounter in the Rose Garden\r\n\r\n\r\nAt 2.30 a little party met together in the Council Chamber: Bundle,\r\nVirginia, Superintendent Battle, M. Lemoine and Anthony Cade.\r\n\r\n“No good waiting until we can get hold of Mr. Lomax,” said Battle.\r\n“This is the kind of business one wants to get on with quickly.”\r\n\r\n“If you’ve got any idea that Prince Michael was murdered by some one\r\nwho got in this way, you’re wrong,” said Bundle. “It can’t be done. The\r\nother end’s blocked completely.”\r\n\r\n“There is no question of that, milady,” said Lemoine quickly. “It is\r\nquite a different search that we make.”\r\n\r\n“Looking for something, are you?” asked Bundle quickly. “Not the\r\nhistoric what-not, by any chance?”\r\n\r\nLemoine looked puzzled.\r\n\r\n“Explain yourself, Bundle,” said Virginia encouragingly. “You can when\r\nyou try.”\r\n\r\n“The thingummybob,” said Bundle. “The historic diamond of purple\r\nprinces that was pinched in the dark ages before I grew to years of\r\ndiscretion.”\r\n\r\n“Who told you this, Lady Eileen?” asked Battle.\r\n\r\n“I’ve always known. One of the footmen told me when I was twelve years\r\nold.”\r\n\r\n“A footman,” said Battle. “Lord! I’d like Mr. Lomax to have heard that!”\r\n\r\n“Is it one of George’s closely guarded secrets?” asked Bundle. “How\r\nperfectly screaming! I never really thought it was true. George always\r\nwas an ass—he must know that servants always know everything.”\r\n\r\nShe went across to the Holbein portrait, touched a spring concealed\r\nsomewhere at the side of it, and immediately, with a creaking noise, a\r\nsection of the panelling swung inward, revealing a dark opening.\r\n\r\n“Entrez, Messieurs et Mesdames,” said Bundle dramatically. “Walk up,\r\nwalk up, dearies. Best show of the season, and only a tanner.”\r\n\r\nBoth Lemoine and Battle were provided with torches. They entered the\r\ndark aperture first, the others close on their heels.\r\n\r\n“Air’s nice and fresh,” remarked Battle. “Must be ventilated somehow.”\r\n\r\nHe walked on ahead. The floor was of rough uneven stone, but the\r\nwalls were bricked. As Bundle had said, the passage extended for a\r\nbare hundred yards. Then it came to an abrupt end with a fallen heap\r\nof masonry. Battle satisfied himself that there was no way of egress\r\nbeyond, and then spoke over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n“We’ll go back, if you please. I wanted just to spy out the land, so to\r\nspeak.”\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes they were back again at the panelled entrance.\r\n\r\n“We’ll start from here,” said Battle. “Seven straight, eight left,\r\nthree right. Take the first as paces.”\r\n\r\nHe paced seven steps carefully, and bending down examined the ground.\r\n\r\n“About right, I should fancy. At one time or another, there’s been\r\na chalk mark made here. Now then, eight left. That’s not paces, the\r\npassage is only wide enough to go Indian file anyway.”\r\n\r\n“Say it in bricks,” suggested Anthony.\r\n\r\n“Quite right, Mr. Cade. Eight bricks from the bottom or the top on the\r\nleft-hand side. Try from the bottom first—it’s easier.”\r\n\r\nHe counted up eight bricks.\r\n\r\n“Now three to the right of that. One, two, three—Hullo—— Hullo,\r\nwhat’s this?”\r\n\r\n“I shall scream in a minute,” said Bundle, “I know I shall. _What_ is\r\nit?”\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Battle was working at the brick with the point of his\r\nknife. His practised eye had quickly seen that this particular brick\r\nwas different from the rest. A minute or two’s work, and he was able to\r\npull it right out. Behind was a small dark cavity. Battle thrust in his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nEvery one waited in breathless expectancy.\r\n\r\nBattle drew out his hand again.\r\n\r\nHe uttered an exclamation of surprise and anger.\r\n\r\nThe others crowded round and stared uncomprehendingly at the three\r\narticles he held. For a moment it seemed as though their eyes must have\r\ndeceived them.\r\n\r\nA card of small pearl buttons, a square of coarse knitting and a piece\r\nof paper on which were inscribed a row of capital E’s!\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Battle. “I’m—I’m danged! What’s the meaning of this?”\r\n\r\n“_Mon Dieu_,” muttered the Frenchman. “_Ça, c’est un peu trop fort!_”\r\n\r\n“But what does it mean?” cried Virginia, bewildered.\r\n\r\n“Mean?” said Anthony. “There’s only one thing it can mean. The late\r\nCount Stylptitch must have had a sense of humour! This is an example\r\nof that humour. I may say that I don’t consider it particularly funny\r\nmyself.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mind explaining your meaning a little more clearly, sir?” said\r\nSuperintendent Battle.\r\n\r\n“Certainly. This was the Count’s little joke. He must have suspected\r\nthat his memorandum had been read. When the crooks came to recover the\r\njewel, they were to find instead this extremely clever conundrum. It’s\r\nthe sort of thing you pin on to yourself at Book Teas, when people have\r\nto guess what you are.”\r\n\r\n“It has a meaning, then?”\r\n\r\n“I should say, undoubtedly. If the Count had meant to be merely\r\noffensive, he would have put a placard with ‘Sold’ on it, or a picture\r\nof a donkey or something crude like that.”\r\n\r\n“A bit of knitting, some capital E’s, and a lot of buttons,” muttered\r\nBattle discontentedly.\r\n\r\n“_C’est inoui_,” said Lemoine angrily.\r\n\r\n“Cipher No. 2,” said Anthony. “I wonder whether Professor Wynward would\r\nbe any good at this one?”\r\n\r\n“When was this passage last used, milady?” asked the Frenchman of\r\nBundle.\r\n\r\nBundle reflected.\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe anyone’s been into it for over two years. The Priest’s\r\nHole is the show exhibit for Americans and tourists generally.”\r\n\r\n“Curious,” murmured the Frenchman.\r\n\r\n“Why curious?”\r\n\r\nLemoine stooped and picked up a small object from the floor.\r\n\r\n“Because of this,” he said. “This match has not lain here for two\r\nyears—not even for two days.”\r\n\r\nBattle looked at the match curiously. It was of pink wood, with a\r\nyellow head.\r\n\r\n“Any of you ladies or gentlemen drop this, by any chance?” he asked.\r\n\r\nHe received a negative all round.\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” said Superintendent Battle, “we’ve seen all there is to\r\nsee. We might as well get out of here.”\r\n\r\nThe proposal was assented to by all. The panel had swung to, but Bundle\r\nshowed them how it was fastened from the inside. She unlatched it,\r\nswung it noiselessly open, and sprang through the opening, alighting in\r\nthe Council Chamber with a resounding thud.\r\n\r\n“Damn!” said Lord Caterham, springing up from an arm-chair in which he\r\nappeared to have been taking forty winks.\r\n\r\n“Poor old father,” said Bundle. “Did I startle you?”\r\n\r\n“I can’t think,” said Lord Caterham, “why nobody nowadays ever sits\r\nstill after a meal. It’s a lost art. God knows Chimneys is big enough,\r\nbut even here there doesn’t seem to be a single room where I can be\r\nsure of a little peace. Good Lord, how many of you are there? Reminds\r\nme of the Pantomimes I used to go to as a boy when hordes of demons\r\nused to pop up out of trapdoors.”\r\n\r\n“Demon No. 7,” said Virginia, approaching him, and patting him on the\r\nhead. “Don’t be cross. We’re just exploring secret passages, that’s\r\nall.”\r\n\r\n“There seems to be a positive boom in secret passages to-day,” grumbled\r\nLord Caterham, not yet completely mollified. “I’ve had to show that\r\nfellow Fish round them all this morning.”\r\n\r\n“When was that?” asked Battle quickly.\r\n\r\n“Just before lunch. It seems he’d heard of the one in here. I showed\r\nhim that, and then took him up to the White Gallery, and we finished\r\nup with the Priest’s Hole. But his enthusiasm was waning by that time.\r\nHe looked bored to death. But I made him go through with it.” Lord\r\nCaterham chuckled at the remembrance.\r\n\r\nAnthony put a hand on Lemoine’s arm.\r\n\r\n“Come outside,” he said softly. “I want to speak to you.”\r\n\r\nThe two men went out together through the window. When they had gone a\r\nsufficient distance from the house, Anthony drew from his pocket the\r\nscrap of paper that Boris had given him that morning.\r\n\r\n“Look here,” he said. “Did you drop this?”\r\n\r\nLemoine took it and examined it with some interest.\r\n\r\n“No,” he said. “I have never seen it before. Why?”\r\n\r\n“Quite sure?”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely sure, Monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“That’s very odd.”\r\n\r\nHe repeated to Lemoine what Boris had said. The other listened with\r\nclose attention.\r\n\r\n“No, I did not drop it. You say he found it in that clump of trees?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I assumed so, but he did not actually say so.”\r\n\r\n“It is just possible that it might have fluttered out of M.\r\nIsaacstein’s suit-case. Question Boris again.” He handed the paper back\r\nto Anthony. After a minute or two he said: “What exactly do you know of\r\nthis man Boris?”\r\n\r\nAnthony shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“I understood he was the late Prince Michael’s trusted servant.”\r\n\r\n“It may be so, but make it your business to find out. Ask some one who\r\nknows, such as the Baron Lolopretjzyl. Perhaps this man was engaged but\r\na few weeks ago. For myself, I have believed him honest. But who knows?\r\nKing Victor is quite capable of making himself into a trusted servant\r\nat a moment’s notice.”\r\n\r\n“Do you really think——”\r\n\r\nLemoine interrupted him.\r\n\r\n“I will be quite frank. With me, King Victor is an obsession. I see him\r\neverywhere. At this moment even I ask myself—this man who is talking\r\nto me, this M. Cade, is he, perhaps, King Victor?”\r\n\r\n“Good Lord,” said Anthony, “you have got it badly.”\r\n\r\n“What do I care for the diamond? For the discovery of the murderer of\r\nPrince Michael? I leave those affairs to my colleague of Scotland Yard\r\nwhose business it is. Me, I am in England for one purpose, and one\r\npurpose only, to capture King Victor and to capture him red-handed.\r\nNothing else matters.”\r\n\r\n“Think you’ll do it?” asked Anthony, lighting a cigarette.\r\n\r\n“How should I know?” said Lemoine, with sudden despondency.\r\n\r\n“H’m!” said Anthony.\r\n\r\nThey had regained the terrace. Superintendent Battle was standing near\r\nthe French window in a wooden attitude.\r\n\r\n“Look at poor old Battle,” said Anthony. “Let’s go and cheer him up.”\r\nHe paused a minute, and said, “You know, you’re an odd fish in some\r\nways, M. Lemoine.”\r\n\r\n“In what ways, M. Cade?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Anthony, “in your place, I should have been inclined\r\nto note down that address that I showed you. It may be of no\r\nimportance—quite conceivably. On the other hand, it might be very\r\nimportant indeed.”\r\n\r\nLemoine looked at him for a minute or two steadily. Then, with a slight\r\nsmile, he drew back the cuff of his left coat sleeve. Pencilled on the\r\nwhite shirt-cuff beneath were the words “Hurstmere, Langly Road, Dover.”\r\n\r\n“I apologize,” said Anthony. “And I retire worsted.”\r\n\r\nHe joined Superintendent Battle.\r\n\r\n“You look very pensive, Battle,” he remarked.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got a lot to think about, Mr. Cade.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I expect you have.”\r\n\r\n“Things aren’t dovetailing. They’re not dovetailing at all.”\r\n\r\n“Very trying,” sympathized Anthony. “Never mind, Battle, if the worst\r\ncomes to the worst, you can always arrest me. You’ve got my guilty\r\nfootprints to fall back upon, remember.”\r\n\r\nBut the superintendent did not smile.\r\n\r\n“Got any enemies here that you know of, Mr. Cade?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“I’ve an idea that the third footman doesn’t like me,” replied\r\nAnthony lightly. “He does his best to forget to hand me the choicest\r\nvegetables. Why?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve been getting anonymous letters,” said Superintendent Battle. “Or\r\nrather an anonymous letter, I should say.”\r\n\r\n“About me?”\r\n\r\nWithout answering Battle took a folded sheet of cheap notepaper from\r\nhis pocket, and handed it to Anthony. Scrawled on it in an illiterate\r\nhandwriting were the words:\r\n\r\n“Look out for Mr. Cade. He isn’t wot he seems.”\r\n\r\nAnthony handed it back with a light laugh.\r\n\r\n“That’s all? Cheer up, Battle. I’m really a King in disguise, you know.”\r\n\r\nHe went into the house, whistling lightly as he walked along. But as\r\nhe entered his bedroom and shut the door behind him, his face changed.\r\nIt grew set and stern. He sat down on the edge of the bed and stared\r\nmoodily at the floor.\r\n\r\n“Things are getting serious,” said Anthony to himself. “Something must\r\nbe done about it. It’s all damned awkward....”\r\n\r\nHe sat there for a minute or two, then strolled to the window. For a\r\nmoment or two he stood looking out aimlessly, and then his eyes became\r\nsuddenly focused on a certain spot, and his face lightened.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” he said. “The Rose Garden! That’s it! The Rose Garden.”\r\n\r\nHe hurried downstairs again and out into the garden by a side door. He\r\napproached the Rose Garden by a circuitous route. It had a little gate\r\nat either end. He entered by the far one, and walked up to the sundial\r\nwhich was on a raised hillock in the exact centre of the garden.\r\n\r\nJust as Anthony reached it, he stopped dead and stared at another\r\noccupant of the Rose Garden who seemed equally surprised to see him.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t know that you were interested in roses, Mr. Fish,” said\r\nAnthony gently.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said Mr. Fish, “I am considerably interested in roses.”\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other warily, as antagonists seek to measure their\r\nopponents’ strength.\r\n\r\n“So am I,” said Anthony.\r\n\r\n“Is that so?”\r\n\r\n“In fact, I dote upon roses,” said Anthony airily.\r\n\r\nA very slight smile hovered upon Mr. Fish’s lips and at the same time\r\nAnthony also smiled. The tension seemed to relax.\r\n\r\n“Look at this beauty now,” said Mr. Fish, stooping to point out a\r\nparticularly fine bloom. “Madame Abel Chatenay, I pressoom it to be.\r\nYes, I am right. This white rose, before the war, was known as Frau\r\nCarl Drusky. They have, I believe, renamed it. Over sensitive, perhaps\r\nbut truly patriotic. The La France is always popular. Do you care for\r\nred roses at all, Mr. Cade? A bright scarlet rose now——”\r\n\r\nMr. Fish’s slow, drawling voice was interrupted. Bundle was leaning out\r\nof a first-floor window.\r\n\r\n“Care for a spin to town, Mr. Fish? I’m just off.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Lady Eileen, but I am vurry happy here.”\r\n\r\n“Sure you won’t change your mind, Mr. Cade?”\r\n\r\nAnthony laughed and shook his head. Bundle disappeared.\r\n\r\n“Sleep is more in my line,” said Anthony, with a wide yawn. “A good\r\nafter luncheon nap!” He took out a cigarette. “You haven’t got a match,\r\nhave you?”\r\n\r\nMr. Fish handed him a match-box. Anthony helped himself, and handed\r\nback the box with a word of thanks.\r\n\r\n“Roses,” said Anthony, “are all very well. But I don’t feel\r\nparticularly horticultural this afternoon.”\r\n\r\nWith a disarming smile, he nodded cheerfully.\r\n\r\nA thundering noise sounded from just outside the house.\r\n\r\n“Pretty powerful engine she’s got in that car of hers,” remarked\r\nAnthony. “There, off she goes.”\r\n\r\nThey had a view of the car speeding down the long drive.\r\n\r\nAnthony yawned again, and strolled towards the house.\r\n\r\nHe passed in through the door. Once inside, he seemed as though changed\r\nto quicksilver. He raced across the hall, out through one of the\r\nwindows on the farther side, and across the park. Bundle, he knew, had\r\nto make a big détour by the lodge gates, and through the village.\r\n\r\nHe ran desperately. It was a race against time. He reached the park\r\nwall just as he heard the car outside. He swung himself up and dropped\r\ninto the road.\r\n\r\n“Hi!” cried Anthony.\r\n\r\nIn her astonishment, Bundle swerved half across the road. She managed\r\nto pull up without accident. Anthony ran after the car, opened the\r\ndoor, and jumped in beside Bundle.\r\n\r\n“I’m coming to London with you,” he said. “I meant to all along.”\r\n\r\n“Extraordinary person,” said Bundle. “What’s that you’ve got in your\r\nhand?”\r\n\r\n“Only a match,” said Anthony.\r\n\r\nHe regarded it thoughtfully. It was pink, with a yellow head. He threw\r\naway his unlighted cigarette, and put the match carefully into his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n24\r\n\r\nThe House at Dover\r\n\r\n\r\n“You don’t mind, I suppose,” said Bundle after a minute or two, “if I\r\ndrive rather fast? I started later than I meant to do.”\r\n\r\nIt had seemed to Anthony that they were proceeding at a terrific speed\r\nalready, but he soon saw that that was nothing compared to what Bundle\r\ncould get out of the Panhard if she tried.\r\n\r\n“Some people,” said Bundle, as she slowed down momentarily to pass\r\nthrough a village, “are terrified of my driving. Poor old father, for\r\ninstance. Nothing would induce him to come up with me in this old bus.”\r\n\r\nPrivately, Anthony thought Lord Caterham was entirely justified.\r\nDriving with Bundle was not a sport to be indulged in by nervous,\r\nmiddle-aged gentlemen.\r\n\r\n“But you don’t seem nervous a bit,” continued Bundle approvingly, as\r\nshe swept round a corner on two wheels.\r\n\r\n“I’m in pretty good training, you see,” explained Anthony gravely.\r\n“Also,” he added, as an afterthought, “I’m rather in a hurry myself.”\r\n\r\n“Shall I speed her up a bit more?” asked Bundle kindly.\r\n\r\n“Good Lord, no,” said Anthony hastily. “We’re averaging about fifty as\r\nit is.”\r\n\r\n“I’m burning with curiosity to know the reason of this sudden\r\ndeparture,” said Bundle, after executing a fanfare upon the Klaxon\r\nwhich must temporarily have deafened the neighbourhood. “But I suppose\r\nI mustn’t ask? You’re not escaping from justice, are you?”\r\n\r\n“I’m not quite sure,” said Anthony. “I shall know soon.”\r\n\r\n“That Scotland Yard man isn’t as much of a rabbit as I thought,” said\r\nBundle thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“Battle’s a good man,” agreed Anthony.\r\n\r\n“You ought to have been in diplomacy,” remarked Bundle. “You don’t part\r\nwith much information, do you?”\r\n\r\n“I was under the impression that I babbled.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! Boy! You’re not eloping with Mademoiselle Brun, by any chance?”\r\n\r\n“Not guilty!” said Anthony with fervour.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause of some minutes during which Bundle caught up and\r\npassed three other cars. Then she asked suddenly:\r\n\r\n“How long have you known Virginia?”\r\n\r\n“That’s a difficult question to answer,” said Anthony, with perfect\r\ntruth. “I haven’t actually met her very often, and yet I seem to have\r\nknown her a long time.”\r\n\r\nBundle nodded.\r\n\r\n“Virginia’s got brains,” she remarked abruptly. “She’s always talking\r\nnonsense, but she’s got brains all right. She was frightfully good out\r\nin Herzoslovakia, I believe. If Tim Revel had lived he’d have had a\r\nfine career—and mostly owing to Virginia. She worked for him tooth and\r\nnail. She did everything in the world she could for him—and I know\r\nwhy, too.”\r\n\r\n“Because she cared for him?” Anthony sat looking very straight ahead of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“No, because she didn’t. Don’t you see? She didn’t love him—she never\r\nloved him, and so she did everything on earth she could to make up.\r\nThat’s Virginia all over. But don’t you make any mistake about it.\r\nVirginia was never in love with Tim Revel.”\r\n\r\n“You seem very positive,” said Anthony, turning to look at her.\r\n\r\nBundle’s little hands were clenched on the steering wheel, and her\r\nchin was stuck out in a determined manner.\r\n\r\n“I know a thing or two. I was only a kid at the time of her marriage,\r\nbut I heard one or two things, and knowing Virginia I can put them\r\ntogether easily enough. Tim Revel was bowled over by Virginia—he was\r\nIrish, you know, and most attractive, with a genius for expressing\r\nhimself well. Virginia was quite young—eighteen. She couldn’t go\r\nanywhere without seeing Tim in a state of picturesque misery, vowing\r\nhe’d shoot himself or take to drink if she didn’t marry him. Girls\r\nbelieve these things—or used to—we’ve advanced a lot in the last\r\neight years. Virginia was carried away by the feeling she thought she’d\r\ninspired. She married him—and she was an angel to him always. She\r\nwouldn’t have been half as much of an angel if she’d loved him. There’s\r\na lot of the devil in Virginia. But I can tell you one thing—she\r\nenjoys her freedom. And anyone will have a hard time persuading her to\r\ngive it up.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder why you tell me all this?” said Anthony slowly.\r\n\r\n“It’s interesting to know about people, isn’t it? Some people, that is.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve wanted to know,” he acknowledged.\r\n\r\n“And you’d never have heard from Virginia. But you can trust me for an\r\ninside tip from the stables. Virginia’s a darling. Even women like her\r\nbecause she isn’t a bit of a cat. And anyway,” Bundle ended, somewhat\r\nobscurely, “one must be a sport, mustn’t one?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, certainly,” Anthony agreed. But he was still puzzled. He had no\r\nidea what had prompted Bundle to give him so much information unasked.\r\nThat he was glad of it, he did not deny.\r\n\r\n“Here are the trams,” said Bundle, with a sigh. “Now, I suppose, I\r\nshall have to drive carefully.”\r\n\r\n“It might be as well,” agreed Anthony.\r\n\r\nHis ideas and Bundle’s on the subject of careful driving hardly\r\ncoincided. Leaving indignant suburbs behind them, they finally emerged\r\ninto Oxford Street.\r\n\r\n“Not bad going, eh?” said Bundle, glancing at her wrist watch.\r\n\r\nAnthony assented fervently.\r\n\r\n“Where do you want to be dropped?”\r\n\r\n“Anywhere. Which way are you going?”\r\n\r\n“Knightsbridge way.”\r\n\r\n“All right, drop me at Hyde Park Corner.”\r\n\r\n“Good-bye,” said Bundle, as she drew up at the place indicated. “What\r\nabout the return journey?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll find my own way back, thanks very much.”\r\n\r\n“I _have_ scared him,” remarked Bundle.\r\n\r\n“I shouldn’t recommend driving with you as a tonic for nervous old\r\nladies, but personally I’ve enjoyed it. The last time I was in equal\r\ndanger was when I was charged by a herd of wild elephants.”\r\n\r\n“I think you’re extremely rude,” remarked Bundle. “We’ve not even had\r\none bump to-day.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry if you’ve been holding yourself in on my account,” retorted\r\nAnthony.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think men are really very brave,” said Bundle.\r\n\r\n“That’s a nasty one,” said Anthony. “I retire, humiliated.” Bundle\r\nnodded and drove on. Anthony hailed a passing taxi. “Victoria Station,”\r\nhe said to the driver as he got in.\r\n\r\nWhen he got to Victoria he paid off the taxi and inquired for the next\r\ntrain to Dover. Unfortunately he had just missed one.\r\n\r\nResigning himself to a wait of something over an hour, Anthony paced up\r\nand down, his brows knit. Once or twice he shook his head impatiently.\r\n\r\nThe journey to Dover was uneventful. Arrived there, Anthony passed\r\nquickly out of the station, and then, as though suddenly remembering,\r\nhe turned back again. There was a slight smile on his lips as he asked\r\nto be directed to Hurstmere, Langly Road.\r\n\r\nThe road in question was a long one, leading right out of the town.\r\nAccording to the porter’s instructions, Hurstmere was the last house.\r\nAnthony trudged along steadily. The little pucker had reappeared\r\nbetween his eyes. Nevertheless there was a new elation in his manner,\r\nas always when danger was near at hand.\r\n\r\nHurstmere was, as the porter had said, the last house in Langly Road.\r\nIt stood well back, enclosed in its own grounds, which were ragged and\r\novergrown. The place, Anthony judged, must have been empty for many\r\nyears. A large iron gate swung rustily on its hinges, and the name on\r\nthe gatepost was half obliterated.\r\n\r\n“A lonely spot,” muttered Anthony to himself, “and a good one to\r\nchoose.”\r\n\r\nHe hesitated a minute or two, glanced quickly up and down the\r\nroad—which was quite deserted—and then slipped quietly past the\r\ncreaking gate into the overgrown drive. He walked up it a little\r\nway, and then stood listening. He was still some distance from the\r\nhouse. Not a sound could be heard anywhere. Some fast yellowing leaves\r\ndetached themselves from one of the trees overhead and fell with a\r\nsoft rustling sound that was almost sinister in the stillness. Anthony\r\nstarted; then smiled.\r\n\r\n“Nerves,” he murmured to himself. “Never knew I had such things before.”\r\n\r\nHe went on up the drive. Presently, as the drive curved, he slipped\r\ninto the shrubbery and so continued his way unseen from the house.\r\nSuddenly he stood still, peering out through the leaves. Some distance\r\naway a dog was barking, but it was a sound nearer at hand that had\r\nattracted Anthony’s attention.\r\n\r\nHis keen hearing had not been mistaken. A man came rapidly round\r\nthe corner of the house, a short square, thickset man, foreign in\r\nappearance. He did not pause but walked steadily on, circling the house\r\nand disappearing again.\r\n\r\nAnthony nodded to himself.\r\n\r\n“Sentry,” he murmured. “They do the thing quite well.”\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had passed, Anthony went on, diverging to the left, and\r\nso following in the footsteps of the sentry.\r\n\r\nHis own footsteps were quite noiseless.\r\n\r\nThe wall of the house was on his right, and presently he came to where\r\na broad blur of light fell on the gravelled walk. The sound of several\r\nmen talking together was clearly audible.\r\n\r\n“My God! what double-dyed idiots,” murmured Anthony to himself. “It\r\nwould serve them right to be given a fright.”\r\n\r\nHe stole up to the window, stooping a little so that he should not be\r\nseen. Presently he lifted his head very carefully to the level of the\r\nsill and looked in.\r\n\r\nHalf a dozen men were sprawling round a table. Four of them were big\r\nthickset men, with high cheek-bones, and eyes set in Magyar slanting\r\nfashion. The other two were rat-like little men with quick gestures.\r\nThe language that was being spoken was French, but the four big men\r\nspoke it with uncertainty and a hoarse guttural intonation.\r\n\r\n“The Boss?” growled one of these. “When will he be here?”\r\n\r\nOne of the smaller men shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“Any time now.”\r\n\r\n“About time, too,” growled the first man. “I have never seen him, this\r\nBoss of yours, but, oh, what great and glorious work might we not have\r\naccomplished in these days of idle waiting!”\r\n\r\n“Fool,” said the other little man bitingly. “Getting nabbed by the\r\npolice is all the great and glorious work you and your precious lot\r\nwould have been likely to accomplish. A lot of blundering gorillas?”\r\n\r\n“Aha!” roared another big thickset fellow. “You insult the Comrades? I\r\nwill soon set the sign of the Red Hand round your throat.”\r\n\r\nHe half rose, glaring ferociously at the Frenchman, but one of his\r\ncompanions pulled him back again.\r\n\r\n“No quarreling,” he grunted. “We’re to work together. From all I heard\r\nthis King Victor doesn’t stand for being disobeyed.”\r\n\r\nIn the darkness, Anthony heard the footsteps of the sentry coming his\r\nround again, and he drew back behind a bush.\r\n\r\n“Who’s that?” said one of the men inside.\r\n\r\n“Carlo—going his rounds.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! What about the prisoner?”\r\n\r\n“He’s all right—coming round pretty fast now. He’s recovered well from\r\nthe crack on the head we gave him.”\r\n\r\nAnthony moved gently away.\r\n\r\n“God! what a lot,” he muttered. “They discuss their affairs with an\r\nopen window, and that fool Carlo goes his round with the tread of an\r\nelephant, and the eyes of a bat. And to crown all, the Herzoslovakians\r\nand the French are on the point of coming to blows. King Victor’s\r\nheadquarters seem to be in a parlous condition. It would amuse me, it\r\nwould amuse me very much, to teach them a lesson.”\r\n\r\nHe stood irresolute for a minute, smiling to himself.\r\n\r\nFrom somewhere above his head came a stifled groan.\r\n\r\nAnthony looked up. The groan came again.\r\n\r\nAnthony glanced quickly from left to right. Carlo was not due round\r\nagain just yet. He grasped the heavy Virginia creeper and climbed\r\nnimbly till he reached the sill of a window. The window was shut, but\r\nwith a tool from his pocket he soon succeeded in forcing up the catch.\r\n\r\nHe paused a minute to listen, then sprang lightly inside the room.\r\nThere was a bed in the far corner and on that bed a man was lying, his\r\nfigure barely discernible in the gloom.\r\n\r\nAnthony went over to the bed, and flashed his pocket torch on the man’s\r\nface. It was a foreign face, pale and emaciated, and the head was\r\nswathed in heavy bandages.\r\n\r\nThe man was bound hand and foot. He stared up at Anthony like one dazed.\r\n\r\nAnthony bent over him, and as he did so he heard a sound behind him and\r\nswung round, his hand travelling to his coat pocket.\r\n\r\nBut a sharp command arrested him.\r\n\r\n“Hands up, sonny. You didn’t expect to see me here, but I happened to\r\ncatch the same train as you at Victoria.”\r\n\r\nIt was Mr. Hiram Fish who was standing in the doorway. He was smiling\r\nand in his hand was a big blue automatic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n25\r\n\r\nTuesday Night at Chimneys\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Caterham, Virginia and Bundle were sitting in the library after\r\ndinner. It was Tuesday evening. Some thirty hours had elapsed since\r\nAnthony’s rather dramatic departure.\r\n\r\nFor at least the seventh time Bundle repeated Anthony’s parting words,\r\nas spoken at Hyde Park Corner.\r\n\r\n“I’ll find my own way back,” repeated Virginia thoughtfully. “That\r\ndoesn’t look as though he expected to be away as long as this. And he’s\r\nleft all his things here.”\r\n\r\n“He didn’t tell you where he was going?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Virginia, looking straight in front of her. “He told me\r\nnothing.”\r\n\r\nAfter this, there was a silence for a minute or two. Lord Caterham was\r\nthe first to break it.\r\n\r\n“On the whole,” he said, “keeping an hotel has some advantages over\r\nkeeping a country house.”\r\n\r\n“Meaning——?”\r\n\r\n“That little notice they always hang up in your room. Visitors\r\nintending departure must give notice before twelve o’clock.”\r\n\r\nVirginia smiled.\r\n\r\n“I dare say,” he continued, “that I am old-fashioned and unreasonable.\r\nIt’s the fashion, I know, to pop in and out of a house. Same idea as an\r\nhotel—perfect freedom of action, and no bill at the end!”\r\n\r\n“You are an old grouser,” said Bundle. “You’ve had Virginia and me.\r\nWhat more do you want?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing more, nothing more,” Lord Caterham assured them hastily.\r\n“That’s not it at all. It’s the principle of the thing. It gives one\r\nsuch a restless feeling. I’m quite willing to admit that it’s been an\r\nalmost ideal twenty-four hours. Peace—perfect peace. No burglaries or\r\nother crimes of violence, no detectives, no Americans. What I complain\r\nof is that I should have enjoyed it all so much more if I’d felt really\r\nsecure. As it is, all the time I’ve been saying to myself ‘One or other\r\nof them is bound to turn up in a minute.’ And that spoilt the whole\r\nthing.”\r\n\r\n“Well, nobody has turned up,” said Bundle. “We’ve been left severely\r\nalone—neglected, in fact. It’s odd the way Fish disappeared. Didn’t he\r\nsay anything?”\r\n\r\n“Not a word. Last time I saw him he was pacing up and down the Rose\r\nGarden yesterday afternoon, smoking one of those unpleasant cigars of\r\nhis. After that he seems to have just melted into the landscape.”\r\n\r\n“Somebody must have kidnapped him,” said Bundle hopefully.\r\n\r\n“In another day or two, I expect we shall have Scotland Yard dragging\r\nthe lake to find his dead body,” said her father gloomily. “It serves\r\nme right. At my time of life, I ought to have gone quietly abroad and\r\ntaken care of my health, and not allowed myself to be drawn into George\r\nLomax’s wild-cat schemes. I——”\r\n\r\nHe was interrupted by Tredwell.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Lord Caterham irritably, “what is it?”\r\n\r\n“The French detective is here, my lord, and would be glad if you could\r\nspare him a few minutes.”\r\n\r\n“What did I tell you?” said Lord Caterham. “I knew it was too good to\r\nlast. Depend upon it, they’ve found Fish’s dead body doubled up in the\r\ngoldfish pond.”\r\n\r\nTredwell, in a strictly respectful manner, steered him back to the\r\npoint of issue.\r\n\r\n“Am I to say that you will see him, my lord?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes. Bring him in here.”\r\n\r\nTredwell departed. He returned a minute or two later announcing in a\r\nlugubrious voice:\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Lemoine.”\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman came in with a quick, light step. His walk, more than his\r\nface, betrayed the fact that he was excited about something.\r\n\r\n“Good evening, Lemoine,” said Lord Caterham. “Have a drink, won’t you?”\r\n\r\n“I thank you, no.” He bowed punctiliously to the ladies. “At last I\r\nmake progress. As things are, I felt that you should be acquainted with\r\nthe discoveries—the very grave discoveries that I have made in the\r\ncourse of the last twenty-four hours.”\r\n\r\n“I thought there must be something important going on somewhere,” said\r\nLord Caterham.\r\n\r\n“My lord, yesterday afternoon one of your guests left this house in\r\na curious manner. From the beginning, I must tell you, I have had my\r\nsuspicions. Here is a man who comes from the wilds. Two months ago he\r\nwas in South Africa. Before that—where?”\r\n\r\nVirginia drew a sharp breath. For a moment the Frenchman’s eyes rested\r\non her doubtfully. Then he went on:\r\n\r\n“Before that—where? None can say. And he is just such a one as\r\nthe man I am looking for—gay, audacious, reckless, one who would\r\ndare anything. I send cable after cable, but I can get no word as\r\nto his past life. Ten years ago he was in Canada, yes, but since\r\nthen—silence. My suspicions grow stronger. Then I picked up one\r\nday a scrap of paper where he has lately passed along. It bears an\r\naddress—the address of a house in Dover. Later, as though by chance,\r\nI drop that same piece of paper. Out of the tail of my eye, I see this\r\nBoris, this Herzoslovakian, pick it up and take it to his master.\r\nAll along I have been sure that this Boris is an emissary of the\r\nComrades of the Red Hand. We know that the Comrades are working in with\r\nKing Victor over this affair. If Boris recognized his Chief in Mr.\r\nAnthony Cade, would he not do just what he has done—transferred his\r\nallegiance? Why should he attach himself otherwise to an insignificant\r\nstranger? It was suspicious, I tell you, very suspicious.\r\n\r\n“But almost I am disarmed, for Anthony Cade brings this same paper to\r\nme at once and asks me if I have dropped it. As I say, almost I am\r\ndisarmed—but not quite! For it may mean that he is innocent, or it may\r\nmean that he is very, very clever. I deny, of course, that it is mine\r\nor that I dropped it. But in the meantime I have set inquiries on foot.\r\nOnly to-day I have news. The house at Dover has been precipitately\r\nabandoned, but up till yesterday afternoon it was occupied by a body\r\nof foreigners. Not a doubt but that it was King Victor’s headquarters.\r\nNow see the significance of these points. Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Cade\r\nclears out from here precipitately. Ever since he dropped that paper,\r\nhe must know that the game is up. He reaches Dover and immediately the\r\ngang is disbanded. What the next move will be, I do not know. What\r\nis quite certain is that Mr. Anthony Cade will not return here. But\r\nknowing King Victor, as I do, I am certain that he will not abandon\r\nthe game without having one more try for the jewel. And that is when I\r\nshall get him!”\r\n\r\nVirginia stood up suddenly. She walked across to the mantelpiece and\r\nspoke in a voice that rang cold like steel.\r\n\r\n“You are leaving one thing out of account, I think, M. Lemoine,” she\r\nsaid. “Mr. Cade is not the only guest who disappeared yesterday in a\r\nsuspicious manner.”\r\n\r\n“You mean, Madame——?”\r\n\r\n“That all you have said applies equally well to another person. What\r\nabout Mr. Hiram Fish?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mr. Fish!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Mr. Fish. Did you not tell us that first night that King\r\nVictor had lately come to England from America? So has Mr. Fish come\r\nto England from America. It is true that he brought a letter of\r\nintroduction from a very well-known man, but surely that would be a\r\nsimple thing for a man like King Victor to manage. He is certainly not\r\nwhat he pretends to be. Lord Caterham has commented on the fact that\r\nwhen it is a question of the first editions he is supposed to have\r\ncome here to see he is always the listener, never the talker. And there\r\nare several suspicious facts against him. There was a light in his\r\nwindow the night of the murder. Then take that evening in the Council\r\nChamber. When I met him on the terrace he was fully dressed. _He_ could\r\nhave dropped the paper. You didn’t actually _see_ Mr. Cade do so. Mr.\r\nCade may have gone to Dover. If he did it was simply to investigate. He\r\nmay have been kidnapped there. I say that there is far more suspicion\r\nattaching to Mr. Fish’s actions than to Mr. Cade’s.”\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman’s voice rang out sharply:\r\n\r\n“From your point of view, that well may be, Madame. I do not dispute\r\nit. And I agree that Mr. Fish is not what he seems.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then?”\r\n\r\n“But that makes no difference. _You see, Madame, Mr. Fish is a\r\nPinkerton’s man._”\r\n\r\n“What?” cried Lord Caterham.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Lord Caterham. He came over here to trail King Victor.\r\nSuperintendent Battle and I have known this for some time.”\r\n\r\nVirginia said nothing. Very slowly she sat down again. With those few\r\nwords the structure that she had built up so carefully was scattered in\r\nruins about her feet.\r\n\r\n“You see,” Lemoine was continuing, “we have all known that eventually\r\nKing Victor would come to Chimneys. It was the one place we were sure\r\nof catching him.”\r\n\r\nVirginia looked up with an odd light in her eyes, and suddenly she\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n“You’ve not caught him yet,” she said.\r\n\r\nLemoine looked at her curiously.\r\n\r\n“No, Madame. But I shall.”\r\n\r\n“He’s supposed to be rather famous for outwitting people, isn’t he?”\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman’s face darkened with anger.\r\n\r\n“This time, it will be different,” he said between his teeth.\r\n\r\n“He’s a very attractive fellow,” said Lord Caterham. “Very attractive.\r\nBut surely—why, you said he was an old friend of yours, Virginia?”\r\n\r\n“That is why,” said Virginia composedly, “I think M. Lemoine must be\r\nmaking a mistake.”\r\n\r\nAnd her eyes met the detective’s steadily, but he appeared in no wise\r\ndiscomfited.\r\n\r\n“Time will show, Madame,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Do you pretend that it was he who shot Prince Michael?” she asked\r\npresently.\r\n\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n\r\nBut Virginia shook her head.\r\n\r\n“Oh, no!” she said. “Oh, no! That is one thing I am quite sure of.\r\nAnthony Cade never killed Prince Michael.”\r\n\r\nLemoine was watching her intently.\r\n\r\n“There is a possibility that you are right, Madame,” he said slowly. “A\r\npossibility, that is all. It may have been the Herzoslovakian, Boris,\r\nwho exceeded his orders and fired that shot. Who knows, Prince Michael\r\nmay have done him some great wrong, and the man sought revenge.”\r\n\r\n“He looks a murderous sort of fellow,” agreed Lord Caterham. “The\r\nhouse-maids, I believe, scream when he passes them in the passages.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Lemoine. “I must be going now. I felt it was due to you,\r\nmy lord, to know exactly how things stand.”\r\n\r\n“Very kind of you, I’m sure,” said Lord Caterham. “Quite certain you\r\nwon’t have a drink? All right then. Good night.”\r\n\r\n“I hate that man with his prim little black beard and his eyeglasses,”\r\nsaid Bundle, as soon as the door had shut behind him. “I hope Anthony\r\n_does_ snoo him. I’d love to see him dancing with rage. What do you\r\nthink about it all, Virginia?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” said Virginia. “I’m tired. I shall go up to bed.”\r\n\r\n“Not a bad idea,” said Lord Caterham. “It’s half-past eleven.”\r\n\r\nAs Virginia was crossing the wide hall, she caught sight of a broad\r\nback that seemed familiar to her discreetly vanishing through a side\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n“Superintendent Battle,” she called imperiously.\r\n\r\nThe superintendent, for it was indeed he, retraced his steps with a\r\nshade of unwillingness.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Mrs. Revel?”\r\n\r\n“M. Lemoine has been here. He says—— Tell me, is it true, really\r\ntrue, that Mr. Fish is an American detective?”\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Battle nodded.\r\n\r\n“That’s right.”\r\n\r\n“You have known it all along?”\r\n\r\nAgain Superintendent Battle nodded.\r\n\r\nVirginia turned away towards the staircase.\r\n\r\n“I see,” she said. “Thank you.”\r\n\r\nUntil that minute she had refused to believe.\r\n\r\nAnd now——?\r\n\r\nSitting down before her dressing-table in her own room, she faced the\r\nquestion squarely. Every word that Anthony had said came back to her\r\nfraught with a new significance.\r\n\r\nWas this the “trade” that he had spoken of?\r\n\r\nThe trade that he had given up. But then——\r\n\r\nAn unusual sound disturbed the even tenor of her meditations. She\r\nlifted her head with a start. Her little gold clock showed the hour to\r\nbe after one. Nearly two hours she had sat here thinking.\r\n\r\nAgain the sound was repeated. A sharp tap on the window-pane. Virginia\r\nwent to the window and opened it. Below on the pathway was a tall\r\nfigure which even as she looked stooped for another handful of gravel.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Virginia’s heart beat faster—then she recognized the\r\nmassive strength and square-cut outline of the Herzoslovakian, Boris.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she said in a low tone. “What is it?”\r\n\r\nAt the moment it did not strike her as strange that Boris should be\r\nthrowing gravel at her window at this hour of the night.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” she repeated impatiently.\r\n\r\n“I come from the Master,” said Boris in a low tone which nevertheless\r\ncarried perfectly. “He has sent for you.”\r\n\r\nHe made the statement in a perfectly matter-of-fact tone.\r\n\r\n“Sent for me?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I am to bring you to him. There is a note. I will throw it up to\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nVirginia stood back a little, and a slip of paper, weighted with a\r\nstone, fell accurately at her feet. She unfolded it and read:\r\n\r\n“_My dear_ (Anthony had written),—_I’m in a tight place, but I mean to\r\nwin through. Will you trust me and come to me?_”\r\n\r\nFor quite two minutes Virginia stood there, immovable, reading those\r\nfew words over again and again.\r\n\r\nShe raised her head, looking round the well-appointed luxury of the\r\nbedroom as though she saw it with new eyes.\r\n\r\nThen she leaned out of the window again.\r\n\r\n“What am I to do?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“The detectives are the other side of the house, outside the Council\r\nChamber. Come down and out through this side door. I will be there. I\r\nhave a car waiting outside in the road.”\r\n\r\nVirginia nodded. Quickly she changed her dress for one of fawn tricot,\r\nand pulled on a little fawn leather hat.\r\n\r\nThen, smiling a little, she wrote a short note, addressed it to Bundle\r\nand pinned it to the pincushion.\r\n\r\nShe stole quietly downstairs and undid the bolts of the side door. Just\r\na moment she paused, then, with a little gallant toss of the head, the\r\nsame toss of the head which her ancestors had gone into action in the\r\nCrusades, she passed through.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n26\r\n\r\nThe 13th of October\r\n\r\n\r\nAt ten o’clock on the morning of Wednesday, the 13th of October,\r\nAnthony Cade walked into Harridge’s Hotel and asked for Baron\r\nLolopretjzyl who was occupying a suite there.\r\n\r\nAfter suitable and imposing delay, Anthony was taken to the suite\r\nin question. The Baron was standing on the hearthrug in a correct\r\nand stiff fashion. Little Captain Andrassy, equally correct as to\r\ndemeanour, but with a slightly hostile attitude, was also present.\r\n\r\nThe usual bows, clicking of heels, and other formal greetings of\r\netiquette took place. Anthony was, by now, thoroughly conversant with\r\nthe routine.\r\n\r\n“You will forgive this early call I trust, Baron,” he said cheerfully,\r\nlaying down his hat and stick on the table. “As a matter of fact, I\r\nhave a little business proposition to make to you.”\r\n\r\n“Ha! Is that so?” said the Baron.\r\n\r\nCaptain Andrassy, who had never overcome his initial distrust of\r\nAnthony, looked suspicious.\r\n\r\n“Business,” said Anthony, “is based on the well-known principle of\r\nsupply and demand. You want something, the other man has it. The only\r\nthing left to settle is the price.”\r\n\r\nThe Baron looked at him attentively, but said nothing.\r\n\r\n“Between a Herzoslovakian nobleman and an English gentleman the terms\r\nshould be easily arranged,” said Anthony rapidly.\r\n\r\nHe blushed a little as he said it. Such words do not rise easily to\r\nan Englishman’s lips, but he had observed on previous occasions the\r\nenormous effect of such phraseology upon the Baron’s mentality. True\r\nenough, the charm worked.\r\n\r\n“That is so,” said the Baron approvingly, nodding his head. “That is\r\nentirely so.”\r\n\r\nEven Captain Andrassy appeared to unbend a little, and nodded his head\r\nalso.\r\n\r\n“Very good,” said Anthony. “I won’t beat about the bush any more——”\r\n\r\n“What is that, you say?” interrupted the Baron. “To beat about the\r\nbush? I do not comprehend?”\r\n\r\n“A mere figure of speech, Baron. To speak in plain English, _you_ want\r\nthe goods, _we_ have them! The ship is all very well, but it lacks a\r\nfigurehead. By the ship, I mean the Loyalist party of Herzoslovakia.\r\nAt the present minute you lack the principal plank of your political\r\nprogramme. You are minus a Prince! Now supposing—only supposing, that\r\nI could supply you with a Prince?”\r\n\r\nThe Baron stared.\r\n\r\n“I do not comprehend you in the least,” he declared.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said Captain Andrassy, twirling his moustache fiercely, “you are\r\ninsulting!”\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” said Anthony. “I’m trying to be helpful. Supply and\r\ndemand, you understand. It’s all perfectly fair and square. No\r\nPrinces supplied unless genuine—see trademark. If we come to terms,\r\nyou’ll find it’s quite all right. I’m offering you the real genuine\r\narticle—out of the bottom drawer.”\r\n\r\n“Not in the least,” the Baron declared again, “do I comprehend you.”\r\n\r\n“It doesn’t really matter,” said Anthony kindly. “I just want you\r\nto get used to the idea. To put it vulgarly, I’ve got something up\r\nmy sleeve. Just get hold of this. You want a Prince. Under certain\r\nconditions, I will undertake to supply you with one.”\r\n\r\nThe Baron and Andrassy stared at him. Anthony took up his hat and stick\r\nagain and prepared to depart.\r\n\r\n“Just think it over. Now, Baron, there is one thing further. You must\r\ncome down to Chimneys this evening—Captain Andrassy also. Several\r\nvery curious things are likely to happen there. Shall we make an\r\nappointment? Say in the Council Chamber at nine o’clock? Thank you,\r\ngentlemen, I may rely upon you to be there?”\r\n\r\nThe Baron took a step forward and looked searchingly in Anthony’s face.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Cade,” he said, not without dignity, “it is not, I hope, that you\r\nwish to make fun of me?”\r\n\r\nAnthony returned his gaze steadily.\r\n\r\n“Baron,” he said, and there was a curious note in his voice, “when this\r\nevening is over, I think you will be the first to admit that there is\r\nmore earnest than jest about this business.”\r\n\r\nBowing to both the men, he left the room.\r\n\r\nHis next call was in the City where he sent in his card to Mr. Herman\r\nIsaacstein.\r\n\r\nAfter some delay, Anthony was received by a pale and exquisitely\r\ndressed underling with an engaging manner, and a military title.\r\n\r\n“You wanted to see Mr. Isaacstein, didn’t you?” said the young man.\r\n“I’m afraid he’s most awfully busy this morning—board meetings and all\r\nthat sort of thing, you know. Is it anything that I can do?”\r\n\r\n“I must see him personally,” said Anthony, and added carelessly. “I’ve\r\njust come up from Chimneys.”\r\n\r\nThe young man was slightly staggered by the mention of Chimneys.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” he said doubtfully. “Well, I’ll see.”\r\n\r\n“Tell him it’s important,” said Anthony.\r\n\r\n“Message from Lord Caterham?” suggested the young man.\r\n\r\n“Something of the kind,” said Anthony, “but it’s imperative that I\r\nshould see Mr. Isaacstein at once.”\r\n\r\nTwo minutes later, Anthony was conducted into a sumptuous inner sanctum\r\nwhere he was principally impressed by the immense size and roomy\r\ndepths of the leather-covered arm-chairs.\r\n\r\nMr. Isaacstein rose to greet him.\r\n\r\n“You must forgive my looking you up like this,” said Anthony. “I know\r\nthat you’re a busy man, and I’m not going to waste more of your time\r\nthan I can help. It’s just a little matter of business that I want to\r\nput before you.”\r\n\r\nIsaacstein looked at him attentively for a minute or two out of his\r\nbeady black eyes.\r\n\r\n“Have a cigar,” he said unexpectedly, holding out an open box.\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” said Anthony. “I don’t mind if I do.”\r\n\r\nHe helped himself.\r\n\r\n“It’s about this Herzoslovakian business,” continued Anthony, as he\r\naccepted a match. He noted the momentary flickering of the other’s\r\nsteady gaze. “The murder of Prince Michael must have rather upset the\r\napplecart.”\r\n\r\nMr. Isaacstein raised one eyebrow, murmured “Ah?” interrogatively and\r\ntransferred his gaze to the ceiling.\r\n\r\n“Oil,” said Anthony, thoughtfully surveying the polished surface of the\r\ndesk. “Wonderful thing, oil.”\r\n\r\nHe felt the slight start the financier gave.\r\n\r\n“Do you mind coming to the point, Mr. Cade?”\r\n\r\n“Not at all. I imagine, Mr. Isaacstein, that if those Oil concessions\r\nare granted to another company you won’t be exactly pleased about it?”\r\n\r\n“What’s the proposition?” asked the other, looking straight at him.\r\n\r\n“A suitable claimant to the throne, full of pro-British sympathies.”\r\n\r\n“Where have you got him?”\r\n\r\n“That’s my business.”\r\n\r\nIsaacstein acknowledged the retort by a slight smile, his glance had\r\ngrown hard and keen.\r\n\r\n“The genuine article? I can’t stand for any funny business.”\r\n\r\n“The absolute genuine article.”\r\n\r\n“Straight?”\r\n\r\n“Straight.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll take your word for it.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t seem to take much convincing?” said Anthony, looking\r\ncuriously at him.\r\n\r\nHerman Isaacstein smiled.\r\n\r\n“I shouldn’t be where I am now if I hadn’t learnt to know whether a man\r\nis speaking the truth or not,” he replied simply. “What terms do you\r\nwant?”\r\n\r\n“The same loan, on the same conditions, that you offered to Prince\r\nMichael?”\r\n\r\n“What about yourself?”\r\n\r\n“For the moment, nothing, except that I want you to come down to\r\nChimneys to-night.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Isaacstein, with some decision. “I can’t do that.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Dining out—rather an important dinner.”\r\n\r\n“All the same, I’m afraid you’ll have to cut it out—for your own sake.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\nAnthony looked at him for a full minute before he said slowly:\r\n\r\n“Do you know that they’ve found the revolver, the one Michael was shot\r\nwith? Do you know where they found it? In your suit-case.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\nIsaacstein almost leapt from his chair. His face was frenzied.\r\n\r\n“What are you saying? What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you.”\r\n\r\nVery obligingly, Anthony narrated the occurrences in connection with\r\nthe finding of the revolver. As he spoke the other’s face assumed a\r\ngreyish tinge of absolute terror.\r\n\r\n“But it’s false,” he screamed out, as Anthony finished. “I never put it\r\nthere. I know nothing about it. It is a plot.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t excite yourself,” said Anthony soothingly. “If that’s the case\r\nyou’ll easily be able to prove it.”\r\n\r\n“Prove it? How can I prove it?”\r\n\r\n“If I were you,” said Anthony gently, “I’d come to Chimneys to-night.”\r\n\r\nIsaacstein looked at him doubtfully.\r\n\r\n“You advise it?”\r\n\r\nAnthony leant forward and whispered to him. The financier fell back in\r\namazement, staring at him.\r\n\r\n“You actually mean——”\r\n\r\n“Come and see,” said Anthony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n27\r\n\r\nThe 13th of October (contd.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe clock in the Council Chamber struck nine.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Lord Caterham, with a deep sigh. “Here they all are, just\r\nlike little Bo Peep’s flock, back again and wagging their tails behind\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nHe looked sadly round the room.\r\n\r\n“Organ grinder complete with monkey,” he murmured, fixing the Baron\r\nwith his eye. “Nosy Parker of Throgmorton Street——”\r\n\r\n“I think you’re rather unkind to the Baron,” protested Bundle, to whom\r\nthese confidences were being poured out. “He told me that he considered\r\nyou the perfect example of English hospitality amongst the _haute\r\nnoblesse_.”\r\n\r\n“I daresay,” said Lord Caterham. “He’s always saying things like that.\r\nIt makes him most fatiguing to talk to. But I can tell you I’m not\r\nnearly as much of the hospitable English gentleman as I was. As soon\r\nas I can, I shall let Chimneys to an enterprising American, and go and\r\nlive in an hotel. There, if anyone worries you, you can just ask for\r\nyour bill and go.”\r\n\r\n“Cheer up,” said Bundle. “We seem to have lost Mr. Fish for good.”\r\n\r\n“I always found him rather amusing,” said Lord Caterham, who was in a\r\ncontradictory temper. “It’s that precious young man of yours who has\r\nlet me in for this. Why should I have this Board meeting called in my\r\nhouse? Why doesn’t he rent The Larches or Elmhurst, or some nice villa\r\nresidence like that at Streatham, and hold his company meetings there?”\r\n\r\n“Wrong atmosphere,” said Bundle.\r\n\r\n“No one is going to play any tricks on us, I hope?” said her father\r\nnervously. “I don’t trust that French fellow, Lemoine. The French\r\npolice are up to all sorts of dodges. Put India-rubber bands round\r\nyour arm, and then reconstruct the crime and make you jump, and it’s\r\nregistered on a thermometer. I know that when they call out ‘Who\r\nkilled Prince Michael?’ I shall register a hundred and twenty-two, or\r\nsomething perfectly frightful, and they’ll haul me off to gaol at once.”\r\n\r\nThe door opened and Tredwell announced:\r\n\r\n“Mr. George Lomax. Mr. Eversleigh.”\r\n\r\n“Enter Codders, followed by faithful dog,” murmured Bundle.\r\n\r\nBill made a bee-line for her, whilst George greeted Lord Caterham in\r\nthe genial manner he assumed for public occasions.\r\n\r\n“My dear Caterham,” said George, shaking him by the hand, “I got your\r\nmessage, and came over, of course.”\r\n\r\n“Very good of you, my dear fellow, very good of you. Delighted to see\r\nyou.” Lord Caterham’s conscience always drove him on to an excess of\r\ngeniality when he was conscious of feeling none. “Not that it was my\r\nmessage, but that doesn’t matter at all.”\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Bill was attacking Bundle in an undertone.\r\n\r\n“I say. What’s it all about? What’s this I hear about Virginia bolting\r\noff in the middle of the night? She’s not been kidnapped, has she?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no,” said Bundle. “She left a note pinned to the pincushion in the\r\northodox fashion.”\r\n\r\n“She’s not gone off with anyone, has she? Not with that Colonial\r\nJohnny? I never liked the fellow and, from all I hear, there seems to\r\nbe an idea floating around that he himself is the super crook. But I\r\ndon’t quite see how that can be?”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“Well, this King Victor was a French fellow, and Cade’s English enough.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t happen to have heard that King Victor was an accomplished\r\nlinguist, and, moreover, was half Irish?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Lord! Then that’s why he’s made himself scarce, is it?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know about his making himself scarce. He disappeared the day\r\nbefore yesterday, as you know. But this morning we got a wire from him,\r\nsaying he would be down here at 9 P.M. to-night, and suggesting that\r\nCodders should be asked over. All these other people have turned up as\r\nwell—asked by Mr. Cade.”\r\n\r\n“It is a gathering,” said Bill, looking round. “One French detective\r\nby window, one English ditto by fireplace. Strong foreign element. The\r\nStars and Stripes don’t seem to be represented?”\r\n\r\nBundle shook her head.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Fish has disappeared into the blue. Virginia’s not here either.\r\nBut every one else is assembled, and I have a feeling in my bones,\r\nBill, that we are drawing very near to the moment when somebody says\r\n‘James, the footman,’ and everything is revealed. We’re only waiting\r\nnow for Anthony Cade to arrive.”\r\n\r\n“He’ll never show up,” said Bill.\r\n\r\n“Then why call this company meeting, as Father calls it?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, there’s some deep idea behind that. Depend upon it. Wants us all\r\nhere while he’s somewhere else—you know the sort of thing.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t think he’ll come, then?”\r\n\r\n“No fear. Run his head into the lion’s mouth? Why, the room’s bristling\r\nwith detectives and high officials.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t know much about King Victor, if you think that would deter\r\nhim. By all accounts, it’s the kind of situation he loves above all,\r\nand he always manages to come out on top.”\r\n\r\nMr. Eversleigh shook his head doubtfully.\r\n\r\n“That would take some doing—with the dice loaded against him. He’ll\r\nnever——”\r\n\r\nThe door opened again and Tredwell announced:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Cade.”\r\n\r\nAnthony came straight across to his host.\r\n\r\n“Lord Caterham,” he said, “I’m giving you a frightful lot of trouble,\r\nand I’m awfully sorry about it. But I really do think that to-night\r\nwill see the clearing up of the mystery.”\r\n\r\nLord Caterham looked mollified. He had always had a secret liking for\r\nAnthony.\r\n\r\n“No trouble at all,” he said heartily.\r\n\r\n“It’s very kind of you,” said Anthony. “We’re all here, I see. Then I\r\ncan get on with the good work.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand,” said George Lomax weightily. “I don’t understand\r\nin the least. This is all very irregular. Mr. Cade has no standing—no\r\nstanding whatever. The position is a very difficult and delicate one. I\r\nam strongly of the opinion——”\r\n\r\nGeorge’s flood of eloquence was arrested. Moving unobtrusively to the\r\ngreat man’s side, Superintendent Battle whispered a few words in his\r\near. George looked perplexed and baffled.\r\n\r\n“Very well, if you say so,” he remarked grudgingly. Then added in a\r\nlouder tone, “I’m sure we are all willing to listen to what Mr. Cade\r\nhas to say.”\r\n\r\nAnthony ignored the palpable condescension of the other’s tone.\r\n\r\n“It’s just a little idea of mine, that’s all,” he said cheerfully.\r\n“Probably all of you know that we got hold of a certain message in\r\ncipher the other day. There was a reference to Richmond, and some\r\nnumbers.” He paused. “Well, we had a shot at solving it—and we failed.\r\nNow in the late Count Stylptitch’s Memoirs (which I happen to have\r\nread) there is a reference to a certain dinner—a ‘Flower’ dinner\r\nwhich every one attended wearing a badge representing a flower. The\r\nCount himself wore the exact duplicate of that curious device we found\r\nin the cavity in the secret passage. It represented a Rose. If you\r\nremember, it was all _rows_ of things—buttons, letter E’s, and finally\r\nrows of knitting. Now, gentlemen, what is there in this house that\r\nis arranged in rows? Books, isn’t that so? Add to that, that in the\r\ncatalogue of Lord Caterham’s library there is a book called _The Life\r\nof the Earl of Richmond_, and I think you will get a very fair idea\r\nof the hiding-place. Starting at the volume in question, and using\r\nthe numbers to denote shelves and books, I think you will find that\r\nthe—er—object of our search is concealed in a dummy book, or in a\r\ncavity behind a particular book.”\r\n\r\nAnthony looked round modestly, obviously waiting for applause.\r\n\r\n“Upon my word, that’s very ingenious,” said Lord Caterham.\r\n\r\n“Quite ingenious,” admitted George condescendingly. “But it remains to\r\nbe seen——”\r\n\r\nAnthony laughed.\r\n\r\n“The proof of the pudding’s in the eating—eh? Well, I’ll soon settle\r\nthat for you.” He sprang to his feet. “I’ll go to the library——”\r\n\r\nHe got no further. M. Lemoine moved forward from the window.\r\n\r\n“Just one moment, Mr. Cade. You permit, Lord Caterham?”\r\n\r\nHe went to the writing-table and hurriedly scribbled a few lines.\r\nHe sealed them up in an envelope, and then rang the bell. Tredwell\r\nappeared in answer to it. Lemoine handed him the note.\r\n\r\n“See that that is delivered at once, if you please.”\r\n\r\n“Very good, sir,” said Tredwell.\r\n\r\nWith his usual dignified tread he withdrew.\r\n\r\nAnthony, who had been standing, irresolute, sat down again.\r\n\r\n“What’s the big idea, Lemoine?” he asked gently.\r\n\r\nThere was a sudden sense of strain in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n“If the jewel is where you say it is—well, it has been there for over\r\nseven years—a quarter of an hour more does not matter.”\r\n\r\n“Go on,” said Anthony. “That wasn’t all you wanted to say?”\r\n\r\n“No, it was not. At this juncture, it is—unwise to permit any one\r\nperson to leave the room. Especially if that person has rather\r\nquestionable antecedents.”\r\n\r\nAnthony raised his eyebrows, and lighted a cigarette.\r\n\r\n“I suppose a vagabond life is not very respectable,” he mused.\r\n\r\n“Two months ago, Mr. Cade, you were in South Africa. That is admitted.\r\nWhere were you before that?”\r\n\r\nAnthony leaned back in his chair, idly blowing smoke rings.\r\n\r\n“Canada. Wild North West.”\r\n\r\n“Are you sure you were not in prison? A French prison?”\r\n\r\nAutomatically, Superintendent Battle moved a step nearer the door, as\r\nif to cut off a retreat that way, but Anthony showed no signs of doing\r\nanything dramatic.\r\n\r\nInstead, he stared at the French detective, and then burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n“My poor Lemoine. It is a monomania with you! You do indeed see King\r\nVictor everywhere. So you fancy that I am that interesting gentleman?”\r\n\r\n“Do you deny it?”\r\n\r\nAnthony brushed a fleck of ash from his coat sleeve.\r\n\r\n“I never deny anything that amuses me,” he said lightly. “But the\r\naccusation is really too ridiculous.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! you think so?” The Frenchman leant forward. His face was twitching\r\npainfully, and yet he seemed perplexed and baffled—as though something\r\nin Anthony’s manner puzzled him. “What if I tell you, Monsieur, that\r\nthis time—this time—I am out to get King Victor, and nothing shall\r\nstop me!”\r\n\r\n“Very laudable,” was Anthony’s comment. “You’ve been out to get him\r\nbefore, though, haven’t you, Lemoine? And he’s got the better of you.\r\nAren’t you afraid that that may happen again? He’s a slippery fellow,\r\nby all accounts.”\r\n\r\nThe conversation had developed into a duel between the detective and\r\nAnthony. Every one else in the room was conscious of the tension. It\r\nwas a fight to a finish between the Frenchman, painfully in earnest,\r\nand the man who smoked so calmly and whose words seemed to show that he\r\nhad not a care in the world.\r\n\r\n“If I were you, Lemoine,” continued Anthony, “I should be very, very\r\ncareful. Watch your step, and all that sort of thing.”\r\n\r\n“This time,” said Lemoine grimly, “there will be no mistake.”\r\n\r\n“You seem very sure about it all,” said Anthony. “But there’s such a\r\nthing as evidence, you know.”\r\n\r\nLemoine smiled, and something in his smile seemed to attract Anthony’s\r\nattention. He sat up and stubbed out his cigarette.\r\n\r\n“You saw that note I wrote just now?” said the French detective. “It\r\nwas to my people at the inn. Yesterday I received from France the\r\nfingerprints and the Bertillon measurements of King Victor—the\r\nso-called Captain O’Neill. I have asked for them to be sent up to me\r\nhere. In a few minutes we shall _know_ whether you are the man!”\r\n\r\nAnthony stared steadily at him. Then a little smile crept over his face.\r\n\r\n“You’re really rather clever, Lemoine. I never thought of that. The\r\ndocuments will arrive, you will induce me to dip my fingers in the ink,\r\nor something equally unpleasant, you will measure my ears and look for\r\nmy distinguishing marks. And if they agree——”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Lemoine, “if they agree—eh?”\r\n\r\nAnthony leaned forward in his chair.\r\n\r\n“Well, if they do agree,” he said very gently, “what then?”\r\n\r\n“What then?” The detective seemed taken aback. “But—I shall have\r\nproved then that you are King Victor!”\r\n\r\nBut for the first time, a shade of uncertainty crept into his manner.\r\n\r\n“That will doubtless be a great satisfaction to you,” said Anthony.\r\n“But I don’t quite see where it’s going to hurt me. I’m not admitting\r\nanything, but supposing, just for the sake of argument, that I was King\r\nVictor—I might be trying to repent, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Repent?”\r\n\r\n“That’s the idea. Put yourself in King Victor’s place, Lemoine. Use\r\nyour imagination. You’ve just come out of prison. You’re getting on\r\nin life. You’ve lost the first fine rapture of the adventurous life.\r\nSay, even, that you meet a beautiful girl. You think of marrying and\r\nsettling down somewhere in the country where you can grow vegetable\r\nmarrows. You decide from henceforth to lead a blameless life. Put\r\nyourself in King Victor’s place. Can’t you imagine feeling like that?”\r\n\r\n“I do not think that I should feel like that,” said Lemoine with a\r\nsardonic smile.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you wouldn’t,” admitted Anthony. “But then you’re not King\r\nVictor, are you? You can’t possibly know what he feels like.”\r\n\r\n“But it is nonsense, what you are saying there,” spluttered the\r\nFrenchman.\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, it isn’t. Come now, Lemoine, if I’m King Victor, what have you\r\nagainst me after all? You could never get the necessary evidence in\r\nthe old, old days, remember. I’ve served my sentence, and that’s all\r\nthere is to it. I suppose you could arrest me for the French equivalent\r\nof ‘Loitering with intent to commit a felony,’ but that would be poor\r\nsatisfaction, wouldn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“You forget,” said Lemoine. “America! How about this business of\r\nobtaining money under false pretences, and passing yourself off as\r\nPrince Nicholas Obolovitch?”\r\n\r\n“No good, Lemoine,” said Anthony, “I was nowhere near America at the\r\ntime. And I can prove that easily enough. If King Victor impersonated\r\nPrince Nicholas in America, then I’m not King Victor. You’re sure he\r\n_was_ impersonated? That it wasn’t the man himself?”\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Battle suddenly interposed.\r\n\r\n“The man was an impostor all right, Mr. Cade.”\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t contradict you, Battle,” said Anthony. “You have such a\r\nhabit of being always right. Are you equally sure that Prince Nicholas\r\ndied in the Congo?”\r\n\r\nBattle looked at him curiously.\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t swear to that, sir. But it’s generally believed.”\r\n\r\n“Careful man. What’s your motto? Plenty of rope, eh? I’ve taken a\r\nleaf out of your book. I’ve given M. Lemoine plenty of rope. I’ve not\r\ndenied his accusations. But, all the same, I’m afraid he’s going to be\r\ndisappointed. You see I always believe in having something up one’s\r\nsleeve. Anticipating that some little unpleasantness might arise here,\r\nI took the precaution to bring a trump card along with me. It—or\r\nrather he—is upstairs.”\r\n\r\n“Upstairs?” said Lord Caterham, very interested.\r\n\r\n“Yes, he’s been having rather a trying time of it lately, poor fellow.\r\nGot a nasty bump on the head from some one. I’ve been looking after\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nSuddenly the deep voice of Mr. Isaacstein broke in:\r\n\r\n“Can we guess who he is?”\r\n\r\n“If you like,” said Anthony, “but——”\r\n\r\nLemoine interrupted with sudden ferocity:\r\n\r\n“All this is foolery. You think to outwit me yet again. It may be true\r\nwhat you say—that you were not in America. You are too clever to say\r\nit if it were not true. But there is something else. Murder! Yes,\r\nmurder. The murder of Prince Michael. He interfered with you that night\r\nas you were looking for the jewel.”\r\n\r\n“Lemoine, have you ever known King Victor to do murder?” Anthony’s\r\nvoice rang out sharply. “You know as well—better than I do, that he\r\nhas never shed blood.”\r\n\r\n“Who else but you could have murdered him?” cried Lemoine. “Tell me\r\nthat!”\r\n\r\nThe last word died on his lips, as a shrill whistle sounded from the\r\nterrace outside. Anthony sprang up, all his assumed nonchalance laid\r\naside.\r\n\r\n“You ask me who murdered Prince Michael?” he cried. “I won’t tell\r\nyou—I’ll _show_ you. That whistle was the signal I’ve been waiting\r\nfor. The murderer of Prince Michael is in the library now.”\r\n\r\nHe sprang out through the window, and the others followed him as he led\r\nthe way round the terrace, until they came to the library window. He\r\npushed the window, and it yielded to his touch.\r\n\r\nVery softly he held aside the thick velvet curtain, so that they could\r\nlook into the room.\r\n\r\nStanding by the bookcase was a dark figure, hurriedly pulling out and\r\nreplacing volumes, so absorbed in the task that no outside sound was\r\nheeded.\r\n\r\nAnd then, as they stood watching, trying to recognize the figure that\r\nwas vaguely silhouetted against the light of the electric torch it\r\ncarried, some one sprang past them with a sound like the roar of a wild\r\nbeast.\r\n\r\nThe torch fell to the ground, was extinguished, and the sounds of a\r\nterrific struggle filled the room. Lord Caterham groped his way to the\r\nlights and switched them on.\r\n\r\nTwo figures were swaying together. And as they looked the end came. The\r\nshort sharp crack of a pistol shot, and the smaller figure crumpled up\r\nand fell. The other figure turned and faced them—it was Boris, his\r\neyes alight with rage.\r\n\r\n“She killed my Master,” he growled. “Now she tries to shoot me. I would\r\nhave taken the pistol from her and shot her, but it went off in the\r\nstruggle. St. Michael directed it. The evil woman is dead.”\r\n\r\n“A woman?” cried George Lomax.\r\n\r\nThey drew nearer. On the floor, the pistol still clasped in her hand,\r\nand an expression of deadly malignity on her face, lay—Mademoiselle\r\nBrun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n28\r\n\r\nKing Victor\r\n\r\n\r\n“I suspected her from the first,” explained Anthony. “There was a\r\nlight in her room on the night of the murder. Afterwards, I wavered.\r\nI made inquiries about her in Brittany, and came back satisfied that\r\nshe was what she represented herself to be. I was a fool. Because the\r\nComtesse de Breteuil had employed a Mademoiselle Brun and spoke highly\r\nof her, it never occurred to me that the real Mademoiselle Brun might\r\nhave been kidnapped on her way to her new post, and that it might be\r\na substitute taking her place. Instead I shifted my suspicions to Mr.\r\nFish. It was not until he had followed me to Dover, and we had had a\r\nmutual explanation that I began to see clearly. Once I knew that he was\r\na Pinkerton’s man, trailing King Victor, my suspicions swung back again\r\nto their original object.\r\n\r\n“The thing that worried me most was that Mrs. Revel had definitely\r\nrecognized the woman. Then I remembered that it was only _after_\r\nI had mentioned her being Madame de Breteuil’s governess. And all\r\nshe had said was that that accounted for the fact that the woman’s\r\nface was familiar to her. Superintendent Battle will tell you that a\r\ndeliberate plot was formed to keep Mrs. Revel from coming to Chimneys.\r\nNothing more nor less than a dead body, in fact. And though the murder\r\nwas the work of the Comrades of the Red Hand, punishing supposed\r\ntreachery on the part of the victim, the staging of it, and the absence\r\nof the Comrades’ sign manual, pointed to some abler intelligence\r\ndirecting operations. From the first, I suspected some connection\r\nwith Herzoslovakia. Mrs. Revel was the only member of the house party\r\nwho had been to the country. I suspected at first that some one was\r\nimpersonating Prince Michael, but that proved to be a totally erroneous\r\nidea. When I realized the possibility of Mademoiselle Brun’s being an\r\nimpostor, and added to that the fact that her face was familiar to Mrs.\r\nRevel, I began to see daylight. It was evidently very important that\r\nshe should not be recognized, and Mrs. Revel was the only person likely\r\nto do so.”\r\n\r\n“But who was she?” said Lord Caterham. “Some one Mrs. Revel had known\r\nin Herzoslovakia?”\r\n\r\n“I think the Baron might be able to tell us,” said Anthony.\r\n\r\n“I?” The Baron stared at him, then down at the motionless figure.\r\n\r\n“Look well,” said Anthony. “Don’t be put off by the make-up. She was an\r\nactress once, remember.”\r\n\r\nThe Baron stared again. Suddenly he started.\r\n\r\n“God in heaven,” he breathed, “it is not possible.”\r\n\r\n“What is not possible?” asked George. “Who is the lady? You recognize\r\nher, Baron?”\r\n\r\n“No, no, it is not possible.” The Baron continued to mutter. “She was\r\nkilled. They were both killed. On the steps of the Palace. Her body was\r\nrecovered.”\r\n\r\n“Mutilated and unrecognizable,” Anthony reminded him. “She managed to\r\nput up a bluff. I think she escaped to America, and has spent a good\r\nmany years lying low in deadly terror of the Comrades of the Red Hand.\r\nThey promoted the Revolution, remember, and, to use an expressive\r\nphrase, they always had it in for her. Then King Victor was released,\r\nand they planned to recover the diamond together. She was searching\r\nfor it that night when she came suddenly upon Prince Michael, and\r\nhe recognized her. There was never much fear of her meeting him in\r\nthe ordinary way of things. Royal guests don’t come in contact with\r\ngovernesses, and she could always retire with a convenient _migraine_,\r\nas she did the day the Baron was here.\r\n\r\n“However, she met Prince Michael face to face when she least expected\r\nit. Exposure and disgrace stared her in the face. She shot him. It was\r\nshe who placed the revolver in Isaacstein’s suit-case, so as to confuse\r\nthe trail, and she who returned the letters.”\r\n\r\nLemoine moved forward.\r\n\r\n“She was coming down to search for the jewel that night, you say,”\r\nhe said. “Might she not have been going to meet her accomplice, King\r\nVictor, who was coming from outside? Eh? What do you say to that?”\r\n\r\nAnthony sighed.\r\n\r\n“Still at it, my dear Lemoine? How persistent you are! You won’t take\r\nmy hint that I’ve got a trump card up my sleeve?”\r\n\r\nBut George, whose mind worked slowly, now broke in.\r\n\r\n“I am still completely at sea. Who was this lady, Baron? You recognize\r\nher, it seems?”\r\n\r\nBut the Baron drew himself up and stood very straight and stiff.\r\n\r\n“You are in error, Mr. Lomax. To my knowledge I have not this lady seen\r\nbefore. A complete stranger she is to me.”\r\n\r\n“But——”\r\n\r\nGeorge stared at him—bewildered.\r\n\r\nThe Baron took him into a corner of the room, and murmured something\r\ninto his ear. Anthony watched, with a good deal of enjoyment, George’s\r\nface turning slowly purple, his eyes bulging, and all the incipient\r\nsymptoms of apoplexy. A murmur of George’s throaty voice came to him.\r\n\r\n“Certainly ... certainly ... by all means ... no need at all ...\r\ncomplicate situation ... utmost discretion.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” Lemoine hit the table sharply with his hand. “I do not care about\r\nall this! The murder of Prince Michael—that was not my affair. I want\r\nKing Victor.”\r\n\r\nAnthony shook his head gently.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry for you, Lemoine. You’re really a very able fellow. But, all\r\nthe same, you’re going to lose the trick. I’m about to play my trump\r\ncard.”\r\n\r\nHe stepped across the room and rang the bell. Tredwell answered it.\r\n\r\n“A gentleman arrived with me this evening, Tredwell.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, a foreign gentleman.”\r\n\r\n“Quite so. Will you kindly ask him to join us here as soon as possible?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\nTredwell withdrew.\r\n\r\n“Entry of the trump card, the mysterious Monsieur X,” remarked Anthony.\r\n“_Who is he?_ Can anyone guess?”\r\n\r\n“Putting two and two together,” said Herman Isaacstein, “what with your\r\nmysterious hints this morning, and your attitude this afternoon, I\r\nshould say there was no doubt about it. Somehow or other you’ve managed\r\nto get hold of Prince Nicholas of Herzoslovakia.”\r\n\r\n“You think the same, Baron?”\r\n\r\n“I do. Unless yet another impostor you have put forward. But that I\r\nwill not believe. With me, your dealings most honourable have been.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Baron. I shan’t forget those words. So you are all agreed?”\r\n\r\nHis eyes swept round the circle of waiting faces. Only Lemoine did not\r\nrespond, but kept his eyes fixed sullenly on the table.\r\n\r\nAnthony’s quick ears had caught the sound of footsteps outside in the\r\nhall.\r\n\r\n“And yet, you know,” he said with a queer smile, “you’re all wrong!”\r\n\r\nHe crossed swiftly to the door and flung it open.\r\n\r\nA man stood on the threshold—a man with a neat black beard,\r\neyeglasses, and a foppish appearance slightly marred by a bandage round\r\nthe head.\r\n\r\n“_Allow me to present you to the real Monsieur Lemoine of the Sûreté._”\r\n\r\nThere was a rush and a scuffle, and then the nasal tones of Mr. Hiram\r\nFish rose bland and reassuring from the window.\r\n\r\n“No, you don’t, Sonny—not this way. I have been stationed here this\r\nwhole evening for the particular purpose of preventing your escape. You\r\nwill observe that I have you covered well and good with this gun of\r\nmine. I came over to get you, and I’ve got you—but you sure are some\r\nlad!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n29\r\n\r\nFurther Explanations\r\n\r\n\r\n“You owe us an explanation, I think, Mr. Cade,” said Herman Isaacstein,\r\nsomewhat later in the evening.\r\n\r\n“There’s nothing much to explain,” said Anthony modestly. “I went to\r\nDover and Fish followed me under the impression that I was King Victor.\r\nWe found a mysterious stranger imprisoned there, and as soon as we\r\nheard his story we knew where we were. The same idea again, you see.\r\nThe real man kidnapped, and the false one—in this case King Victor\r\nhimself—takes his place. But it seems that Battle here always thought\r\nthere was something fishy about his French colleague, and wired to\r\nParis for his fingerprints and other means of identification.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” cried the Baron. “The fingerprints. The Bertillon measurements\r\nthat that scoundrel talked about?”\r\n\r\n“It was a clever idea,” said Anthony. “I admired it so much that I\r\nfelt forced to play up. Besides, my doing so puzzled the false Lemoine\r\nenormously. You see, as soon as I had given the tip about the ‘rows’\r\nand where the jewel really was, he was keen to pass on the news to\r\nhis accomplice, and at the same time to keep us all in that room. The\r\nnote was really to Mademoiselle Brun. He told Tredwell to deliver it\r\nat once, and Tredwell did so by taking it upstairs to the schoolroom.\r\nLemoine accused me of being King Victor, by that means creating a\r\ndiversion and preventing anyone from leaving the room. By the time all\r\nthat had been cleared up and we adjourned to the library to look for\r\nthe stone, he flattered himself that the stone would be no longer\r\nthere to find!”\r\n\r\nGeorge cleared his throat.\r\n\r\n“I must say, Mr. Cade,” he said pompously, “that I consider your\r\naction in that matter highly reprehensible. If the slightest hitch had\r\noccurred in your plans, one of our national possessions might have\r\ndisappeared beyond the hope of recovery. It was foolhardy, Mr. Cade,\r\nreprehensibly foolhardy.”\r\n\r\n“I guess you haven’t tumbled to the little idea, Mr. Lomax,” said the\r\ndrawling voice of Mr. Fish. “That historic diamond was never behind the\r\nbooks in the library.”\r\n\r\n“Never?”\r\n\r\n“Not on your life.”\r\n\r\n“You see,” explained Anthony, “that little device of Count Stylptitch’s\r\nstood for what it had originally stood for—a Rose. When that dawned\r\nupon me on Monday afternoon, I went straight to the Rose Garden. Mr.\r\nFish had already tumbled to the same idea. If, standing with your back\r\nto the sundial, you take seven paces straight forward, then eight to\r\nthe left and three to the right, you come to some bushes of a bright\r\nred rose called Richmond. The house has been ransacked to find the\r\nhiding-place, but nobody has thought of digging in the garden. I\r\nsuggest a little digging party to-morrow morning.”\r\n\r\n“Then the story about the books in the library—”\r\n\r\n“An invention of mine to trap the lady. Mr. Fish kept watch on the\r\nterrace, and whistled when the psychological moment had arrived. I may\r\nsay that Mr. Fish and I established martial law at the Dover house, and\r\nprevented the Comrades from communicating with the false Lemoine. He\r\nsent them an order to clear out, and word was conveyed to him that this\r\nhad been done. So he went happily ahead with his plans for denouncing\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well,” said Lord Caterham cheerfully, “everything seems to have\r\nbeen cleared up most satisfactorily.”\r\n\r\n“Everything but one thing,” said Mr. Isaacstein.\r\n\r\n“What is that?”\r\n\r\nThe great financier looked steadily at Anthony.\r\n\r\n“What did you get me down here for? Just to assist at a dramatic scene\r\nas an interested onlooker.”\r\n\r\nAnthony shook his head.\r\n\r\n“No, Mr. Isaacstein. You are a busy man whose time is money. Why did\r\nyou come down here originally?”\r\n\r\n“To negotiate a loan.”\r\n\r\n“With whom?”\r\n\r\n“Prince Michael of Herzoslovakia.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly. Prince Michael is dead. Are you prepared to offer the same\r\nloan on the same terms to his cousin Nicholas?”\r\n\r\n“Can you produce him? I thought he was killed in the Congo?”\r\n\r\n“He was killed all right. I killed him. Oh, no, I’m not a murderer.\r\nWhen I say I killed him, I mean that I spread the report of his death.\r\nI promised you a Prince, Mr. Isaacstein. Will _I_ do?”\r\n\r\n“You?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I’m the man. Nicholas Sergius Alexander Ferdinand Obolovitch.\r\nRather long for the kind of life I proposed to live, so I emerged from\r\nthe Congo as plain Anthony Cade.”\r\n\r\nLittle Captain Andrassy sprang up.\r\n\r\n“But this is incredible—incredible,” he spluttered. “Have a care, sir,\r\nwhat you say.”\r\n\r\n“I can give you plenty of proofs,” said Anthony quietly. “I think I\r\nshall be able to convince the Baron here.”\r\n\r\nThe Baron lifted his hand.\r\n\r\n“Your proofs I will examine, yes. But of them for me there is no need.\r\nYour word alone sufficient for me is. Besides, your English mother you\r\nmuch resemble. All along have I said: ‘This young man on one side or\r\nthe other most highly born is’.”\r\n\r\n“You have always trusted my word, Baron,” said Anthony. “I can assure\r\nyou that in the days to come I shall not forget.”\r\n\r\nThen he looked over at Superintendent Battle whose face had remained\r\nperfectly expressionless.\r\n\r\n“You can understand,” said Anthony with a smile, “that my position\r\nhas been extremely precarious. Of all those in the house I might\r\nbe supposed to have the best reason for wishing Michael Obolovitch\r\nout of the way, since I was the next heir to the Throne. I’ve been\r\nextraordinarily afraid of Battle all along. I always felt that he\r\nsuspected me, but that he was held up by lack of motive.”\r\n\r\n“I never believed for a minute that you’d shot him, sir,” said\r\nSuperintendent Battle. “We’ve got a feeling in such matters. But I\r\nknew that you were afraid of something, and you puzzled me. If I’d\r\nknown sooner who you really were, I dare say I’d have yielded to the\r\nevidence, and arrested you.”\r\n\r\n“I’m glad I managed to keep one guilty secret from you. You wormed\r\neverything else out of me all right. You’re a damned good man at your\r\njob, Battle. I shall always think of Scotland Yard with respect.”\r\n\r\n“Most amazing,” muttered George. “Most amazing story I ever heard. I—I\r\ncan really hardly believe it. You are quite sure, Baron, that——”\r\n\r\n“My dear Mr. Lomax,” said Anthony, with a slight hardness in his tone,\r\n“I have no intention of asking the British Foreign Office to support\r\nmy claim without bringing forward the most convincing documentary\r\nevidence. I suggest that we adjourn now, and that you, the Baron, Mr.\r\nIsaacstein and myself discuss the terms of the proposed loan.”\r\n\r\nThe Baron rose to his feet, and clicked his heels together.\r\n\r\n“It will be the proudest moment of my life, sir,” he said solemnly,\r\n“when I see you King of Herzoslovakia.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, by the way, Baron,” said Anthony carelessly, slipping his hand\r\nthrough the other’s arm, “I forgot to tell you. There’s a string tied\r\nto this. I’m married, you know.”\r\n\r\nThe Baron retreated a step or two. Dismay overspread his countenance.\r\n\r\n“Something wrong I knew there would be,” he boomed. “Merciful God in\r\nHeaven! He has married a black woman in Africa!”\r\n\r\n“Come, come, it’s not so bad as all that,” said Anthony, laughing.\r\n“She’s white enough—white all through, bless her.”\r\n\r\n“Good. A respectable morganatic affair it can be, then.”\r\n\r\n“Not a bit of it. She’s to play Queen to my King. It’s no use shaking\r\nyour head. She’s fully qualified for the post. She’s the daughter of\r\nan English peer who dates back to the time of the Conqueror. It’s very\r\nfashionable just now for Royalties to marry into the aristocracy—and\r\nshe knows something of Herzoslovakia.”\r\n\r\n“My God!” cried George Lomax, startled out of his usual careful speech.\r\n“Not—not—Virginia Revel?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Anthony. “Virginia Revel.”\r\n\r\n“My dear fellow,” cried Lord Caterham, “I mean—sir, I congratulate\r\nyou, I do indeed. A delightful creature.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Lord Caterham,” said Anthony. “She’s all you say and more.”\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Isaacstein was regarding him curiously.\r\n\r\n“You’ll excuse my asking your Highness, but when did this marriage take\r\nplace?”\r\n\r\nAnthony smiled back at him.\r\n\r\n“As a matter of fact,” he said, “I married her this morning.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n30\r\n\r\nAnthony Signs on for a New Job\r\n\r\n\r\n“If you will go on, gentlemen, I will follow you in a minute,” said\r\nAnthony.\r\n\r\nHe waited whilst the others filed out, and then turned to where\r\nSuperintendent Battle was standing apparently absorbed in examining the\r\npanelling.\r\n\r\n“Well, Battle? Want to ask me something, don’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I do, sir, though I don’t know how you knew I did. But I always\r\nmarked you out as being specially quick in the uptake. I take it that\r\nthe lady who is dead was the late Queen Varaga?”\r\n\r\n“Quite right, Battle. It’ll be hushed up, I hope. You can understand\r\nwhat I feel about family skeletons.”\r\n\r\n“Trust Mr. Lomax for that, sir. No one will ever know. That is, a lot\r\nof people will know, but it won’t get about.”\r\n\r\n“Was that what you wanted to ask me about?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir—that was only in passing. I was curious to know just what\r\nmade you drop your own name—if I’m not taking too much of a liberty?”\r\n\r\n“Not a bit. I’ll tell you. I killed myself from the purest motives,\r\nBattle. My mother was English, I’d been educated in England, and I\r\nwas far more interested in England than in Herzoslovakia. And I felt\r\nan absolute fool knocking about the world with a comic opera title\r\ntacked on to me. You see, when I was very young, I had democratic\r\nideas. Believed in the purity of ideals, and the equality of all men. I\r\nespecially disbelieved in Kings and Princes.”\r\n\r\n“And since then?” asked Battle shrewdly.\r\n\r\n“Oh, since then, I’ve travelled and seen the world. There’s damned\r\nlittle equality going about. Mind you, I still believe in democracy.\r\nBut you’ve got to force it on people with a strong hand—ram it down\r\ntheir throats. Men don’t want to be brothers—they may some day, but\r\nthey don’t now. My final belief in the Brotherhood of Man died the day\r\nI arrived in London last week, when I observed the people standing\r\nin a Tube train resolutely refuse to move up and make room for those\r\nwho entered. You won’t turn people into angels by appealing to their\r\nbetter natures just yet awhile—but by judicious force you can coerce\r\nthem into behaving more or less decently to one another to go on\r\nwith. I still believe in the Brotherhood of Man, but it’s not coming\r\nyet awhile. Say another ten thousand years or so. It’s no good being\r\nimpatient. Evolution is a slow process.”\r\n\r\n“I’m very interested in these views of yours, sir,” said Battle with a\r\ntwinkle. “And if you’ll allow me to say so, I’m sure you’ll make a very\r\nfine King out there.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Battle,” said Anthony with a sigh.\r\n\r\n“You don’t seem very happy about it, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don’t know. I dare say it will be rather fun. But it’s tying\r\noneself down to regular work. I’ve always avoided that before.”\r\n\r\n“But you consider it your duty, I suppose, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Good Lord, no! What an idea. It’s a woman—it’s always a woman,\r\nBattle. I’d do more than be a King for her sake.”\r\n\r\n“Quite so, sir.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve arranged it so that the Baron and Isaacstein can’t kick. The one\r\nwants a King and the other wants oil. They’ll both get what they want,\r\nand I’ve got—Oh, Lord, Battle, have you ever been in love?”\r\n\r\n“I am much attached to Mrs. Battle, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Much attached to Mrs.—Oh, you don’t know what I’m talking about! It’s\r\nentirely different!”\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, sir, that man of yours is waiting outside the window.”\r\n\r\n“Boris? So he is. He’s a wonderful fellow. It’s a mercy that pistol\r\nwent off in the struggle and killed the lady. Otherwise Boris would\r\nhave wrung her neck as sure as Fate, and then you would have wanted to\r\nhang him. His attachment to the Obolovitch dynasty is remarkable. The\r\nqueer thing was that as soon as Michael was dead he attached himself to\r\nme—and yet he couldn’t possibly have known who I really was.”\r\n\r\n“Instinct,” said Battle. “Like a dog.”\r\n\r\n“Very awkward instinct I thought it at the time. I was afraid it might\r\ngive the show away to you. I suppose I’d better see what he wants.”\r\n\r\nHe went out through the window. Superintendent Battle, left alone,\r\nlooked after him for a minute, then apparently addressed the panelling.\r\n\r\n“He’ll do,” said Superintendent Battle.\r\n\r\nOutside, Boris explained himself.\r\n\r\n“Master,” said he, and led the way along the terrace.\r\n\r\nAnthony followed him, wondering what was forward.\r\n\r\nPresently Boris stopped and pointed with his forefinger. It was\r\nmoonlight, and in front of them was a stone seat on which sat two\r\nfigures.\r\n\r\n“He _is_ a dog,” said Anthony to himself. “And what’s more, a pointer!”\r\n\r\nHe strode forward. Boris melted into the shadows.\r\n\r\nThe two figures rose to meet him. One of them was Virginia—the\r\nother——\r\n\r\n“Hullo, Joe,” said a well remembered voice. “This is a great girl of\r\nyours.”\r\n\r\n“Jimmy McGrath, by all that’s wonderful,” cried Anthony. “How in the\r\nname of fortune did you get here?”\r\n\r\n“That trip of mine into the interior went phut. Then some Dagos came\r\nmonkeying round. Wanted to buy that manuscript off me. Next thing I as\r\nnear as nothing got a knife in the back one night. That made me think\r\nthat I’d handed you out a bigger job than I knew. I thought you might\r\nneed help, and I came along after you by the very next boat.”\r\n\r\n“Wasn’t it splendid of him?” said Virginia. She squeezed Jimmy’s arm.\r\n“Why didn’t you ever tell me how frightfully nice he was? You are,\r\nJimmy, you’re a perfect dear.”\r\n\r\n“You two seem to be getting along all right,” said Anthony.\r\n\r\n“Sure thing,” said Jimmy. “I was snooping round for news of you, when\r\nI connected with this dame. She wasn’t at all what I thought she’d\r\nbe—some swell haughty Society lady that’d scare the life out of me.”\r\n\r\n“He told me all about the letters,” said Virginia. “And I feel almost\r\nashamed not to have been in real trouble over them when he was such a\r\nknight-errant.”\r\n\r\n“If I’d known what you were like,” said Jimmy gallantly, “I’d not have\r\ngiven him the letters. I’d have brought them to you myself. Say, young\r\nman, is the fun really over? Is there nothing for me to do?”\r\n\r\n“By Jove,” said Anthony, “there is! Wait a minute.”\r\n\r\nHe disappeared into the house. In a minute or two he returned with a\r\npaper package which he cast into Jimmy’s arms.\r\n\r\n“Go round to the garage and help yourself to a likely looking car. Beat\r\nit to London and deliver that parcel at 17, Everdean Square. That’s\r\nMr. Balderson’s private address. In exchange he’ll hand you a thousand\r\npounds.”\r\n\r\n“What? It’s not the Memoirs? I understood that they’d been burnt.”\r\n\r\n“What do you take me for?” demanded Anthony. “You don’t think I’d fall\r\nfor a story like that, do you? I rang up the publishers at once, found\r\nout that the other was a fake call, and arranged accordingly. I made up\r\na dummy package as I’d been directed to do. But I put the real package\r\nin the Manager’s safe and handed over the dummy. The Memoirs have never\r\nbeen out of my possession.”\r\n\r\n“Bully for you, my son,” said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Anthony,” cried Virginia. “You’re not going to let them be\r\npublished?”\r\n\r\n“I can’t help myself. I can’t let a pal like Jimmy down. But you\r\nneedn’t worry. I’ve had time to wade through them, and I see now why\r\npeople always hint that bigwigs don’t write their own reminiscences\r\nbut hire some one to do it for them. As a writer, Stylptitch is an\r\ninsufferable bore. He proses on about statecraft, and doesn’t go in for\r\nany racy and indiscreet anecdotes. His ruling passion of secrecy held\r\nstrong to the end. There’s not a word in the Memoirs from beginning to\r\nend to flutter the susceptibilities of the most difficult politician.\r\nI rang up Balderson to-day, and arranged with him that I’d deliver the\r\nmanuscript to-night before midnight. But Jimmy can do his own dirty\r\nwork now that’s he’s here.”\r\n\r\n“I’m off,” said Jimmy. “I like the idea of that thousand\r\npounds—especially when I’d made up my mind I was down and out.”\r\n\r\n“Half a second,” said Anthony. “I’ve got a confession to make to you,\r\nVirginia. Something that every one else knows, but that I haven’t yet\r\ntold you.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t mind how many strange women you’ve loved so long as you don’t\r\ntell me about them.”\r\n\r\n“Women!” said Anthony, with a virtuous air. “Women indeed? You ask\r\nJames here what kind of women I was going about with last time he saw\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“Frumps,” said Jimmy solemnly. “Utter frumps. Not one a day under\r\nforty-five.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Jimmy,” said Anthony, “you’re a true friend. No, it’s much\r\nworse than that. I’ve deceived you as to my real name.”\r\n\r\n“Is it very dreadful?” said Virginia, with interest. “It isn’t\r\nsomething silly like Pobbles, is it? Fancy being called Mrs. Pobbles.”\r\n\r\n“You are always thinking the worst of me.”\r\n\r\n“I admit that I did once think you were King Victor, but only for about\r\na minute and a half.”\r\n\r\n“By the way, Jimmy, I’ve got a job for you—gold prospecting in the\r\nrocky fastnesses of Herzoslovakia.”\r\n\r\n“Is there gold there?” asked Jimmy eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Sure to be,” said Anthony. “It’s a wonderful country.”\r\n\r\n“So you’re taking my advice and going there?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Anthony. “Your advice was worth more than you knew. Now\r\nfor the confession. I wasn’t changed at nurse, or anything romantic\r\nlike that, but nevertheless I am really Prince Nicholas Obolovitch of\r\nHerzoslovakia.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Anthony,” cried Virginia. “How perfectly screaming! And I have\r\nmarried you! What are we going to do about it?”\r\n\r\n“We’ll go to Herzoslovakia and pretend to be Kings and Queens. Jimmy\r\nMcGrath once said that the average life of a King or Queen out there is\r\nunder four years. I hope you don’t mind?”\r\n\r\n“Mind?” cried Virginia. “I shall love it!”\r\n\r\n“Isn’t she great?” murmured Jimmy.\r\n\r\nThen, discreetly, he faded into the night. A few minutes later the\r\nsound of a car was heard.\r\n\r\n“Nothing like letting a man do his own dirty work,” said Anthony, with\r\nsatisfaction. “Besides, I didn’t know how else to get rid of him. Since\r\nwe were married I’ve not had one minute alone with you.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll have a lot of fun,” said Virginia. “Teaching the brigands not\r\nto be brigands, and the assassins not to assassinate, and generally\r\nimproving the moral tone of the country.”\r\n\r\n“I like to hear these pure ideals,” said Anthony. “It makes me feel my\r\nsacrifice has not been in vain.”\r\n\r\n“Rot,” said Virginia calmly, “you’ll enjoy being a King. It’s in your\r\nblood, you know. You were brought up to the trade of Royalty, and\r\nyou’ve got a natural aptitude for it, just like plumbers have a natural\r\nbent for plumbing.”\r\n\r\n“I never think they have,” said Anthony. “But damn it all, don’t let’s\r\nwaste time talking about plumbers. Do you know that at this very\r\nminute I’m supposed to be deep in conference with Isaacstein and old\r\nLollipop? They want to talk about oil. Oil, my God! They can just\r\nawait my kingly pleasure. Virginia, do you remember my telling you once\r\nthat I’d have a damned good try to make you care for me.”\r\n\r\n“I remember,” said Virginia softly. “But Superintendent Battle was\r\nlooking out of the window.”\r\n\r\n“Well, he isn’t now,” said Anthony.\r\n\r\nHe caught her suddenly to him, kissing her eyelids, her lips, the green\r\ngold of her hair....\r\n\r\n“I do love you so, Virginia,” he whispered. “I do love you so. Do you\r\nlove me?”\r\n\r\nHe looked down at her—sure of the answer.\r\n\r\nHer head rested against his shoulder, and very low, in a sweet shaken\r\nvoice, she answered:\r\n\r\n“Not a bit!”\r\n\r\n“You little devil,” cried Anthony, kissing her again. “Now I know for\r\ncertain that I shall love you until I die....”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n31\r\n\r\nSundry Details\r\n\r\n\r\nScene—Chimneys, 11 A.M. Thursday morning.\r\n\r\nJohnson, the police constable, with his coat off, digging.\r\n\r\nSomething in the nature of a funeral feeling seems to be in the air.\r\nThe friends and relations stand round the grave that Johnson is digging.\r\n\r\nGeorge Lomax has the air of the principal beneficiary under the will\r\nof the deceased. Superintendent Battle, with his immovable face, seems\r\npleased that the funeral arrangements have gone so nicely. As the\r\nundertaker, it reflects credit upon him. Lord Caterham has that solemn\r\nand shocked look which Englishmen assume when a religious ceremony is\r\nin progress.\r\n\r\nMr. Fish does not fit into the picture so well. He is not sufficiently\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\nJohnson bends to his task. Suddenly he straightens up. A little stir of\r\nexcitement passes round.\r\n\r\n“That’ll do, sonny,” says Mr. Fish. “We shall do nicely now.”\r\n\r\nOne perceives at once that he is really the family physician.\r\n\r\nJohnson retires. Mr. Fish, with due solemnity, stoops over the\r\nexcavation. The surgeon is about to operate.\r\n\r\nHe brings out a small canvas package. With much ceremony he hands it\r\nto Superintendent Battle. The latter, in his turn, hands it to George\r\nLomax. The etiquette of the situation has now been fully complied with.\r\n\r\nGeorge Lomax unwraps the package, slits up the oil-silk inside it,\r\nburrows into further wrapping. For a moment he holds something on the\r\npalm of his hand—then quickly shrouds it once more in cotton wool.\r\n\r\nHe clears his throat.\r\n\r\n“At this auspicious minute,” he begins, with the clear delivery of the\r\npractised speaker.\r\n\r\nLord Caterham beats a precipitate retreat. On the terrace he finds his\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\n“Bundle, is that car of yours in order?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Why?”\r\n\r\n“Then take me up to town in it immediately. I’m going abroad at\r\nonce—to-day.”\r\n\r\n“But, father——”\r\n\r\n“Don’t argue with me, Bundle. George Lomax told me when he arrived this\r\nmorning that he was anxious to have a few words with me privately on a\r\nmatter of the utmost delicacy. He added that the King of Timbuctoo was\r\narriving in London shortly. I won’t go through it again, Bundle, do you\r\nhear? Not for fifty George Lomaxes! If Chimneys is so valuable to the\r\nnation, let the nation buy it. Otherwise I shall sell it to a syndicate\r\nand they can turn it into an hotel.”\r\n\r\n“Where is Codders now?”\r\n\r\nBundle is rising to the situation.\r\n\r\n“At the present minute,” replied Lord Caterham, looking at his watch,\r\n“he is good for at least fifteen minutes about the Empire.”\r\n\r\nAnother picture.\r\n\r\nMr. Bill Eversleigh, not invited to be present at the graveside\r\nceremony, at the telephone.\r\n\r\n“No, really, I mean it.... I say, don’t be huffy.... Well, you will\r\nhave supper to-night anyway?... No, I haven’t. I’ve been kept to it\r\nwith my nose at the grindstone. You’ve no idea what Codders is like....\r\nI say, Dolly, you know jolly well what I think about you.... You know\r\nI’ve never cared for anyone but you.... Yes, I’ll come to the show\r\nfirst. How does the old wheeze go? ‘And the little girl tries, Hooks\r\nand Eyes’....”\r\n\r\nUnearthly sounds. Mr. Eversleigh trying to hum the refrain in question.\r\n\r\nAnd now George’s peroration draws to a close.\r\n\r\n... “the lasting peace and prosperity of the British Empire!”\r\n\r\n“I guess,” said Mr. Hiram Fish _sotto voce_ to himself and the world at\r\nlarge, “that this has been a great little old week.”\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER’S NOTES:\r\n\r\n   Italicized text is surrounded by underscores: _italics_.\r\n\r\n   Obvious typographical errors have been corrected.",

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks."
