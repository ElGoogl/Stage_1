If, however,\nshe is inclined to think it an arduous task, let her turn to these\nrecipes, and she will be convinced that the labor and the time expended\nbring their own reward in the satisfaction gained by knowing that one\nhas served a delicious drink delightfully made.\n\nThere may be the feeling, if my hostess lives in an apartment, that\nthere is not room enough to store these syrups and vinegars, and while\nthat may be true in part, it is always possible to keep two or three\npopular syrups in quart bottles, and at least one bottle of fruit\nvinegar, in the refrigerator.\n\nAs both syrups and vinegars may be made in small quantities, one may\nmake them oftener and make enough to last a week or two.\n\nThere are one or two things I would impress upon the hostess who would\nbe popular, and if I refer to these things again in the book, I trust\nI may be pardoned, for they are most imperative.\n\nFirst: the necessity for selecting attractive glassware, which need not\nbe expensive, but should be thin and clear, and, when in use, should\nalways be polished.\n\nWhen purchasing linen, select it because of its daintiness rather than\nfor its elaborateness. Plate doylies and serviettes which are plain\nand fine may be purchased for a very little money if care is taken.\nWho would not rather use a doylie with a button-holed edge, spotlessly\nclean, than one heavily embroidered which will require three times the\nlabor to launder?\n\nIf drinks are served by the maid, it is as essential that her cuffs,\ncollar, cap and apron be as spotless as the doylies on the service\nplates.\n\nWhen cold drinks are served, be sure that the glasses are chilled.\n\nFor hot drinks, heat the cups or glasses before pouring the drinks.\n\nPlace the glass or cup on a doylie on a small plate.\n\nWhen serving an invalid, be over-particular; the glass must shine, the\ndoylie be spotless, and the plate the most attractive obtainable. If it\nis possible lay a flower on the plate or tray before it is sent into\nthe ill one’s room.\n\nThe appetite of a very finicky person may be tempted by this\nover-carefulness.\n\n                                               BERTHA E.

I use the measures I have in my kitchen, and\nhave used them in making these recipes. Surely one has a quart cup, a\nhalf pint, or one cup, measure and a set of spoons; the tablespoon,\ndessertspoon, teaspoon and half teaspoon. Some sets have the\nquarter-teaspoon too. These sets, made of aluminum, may be purchased\nin any hardware store, or in the housekeeping department in the large\nshops at very reasonable prices. The glass cup is marked for quarter,\nhalf and three-quarters on one side, while on the reverse the marking\nis for one-third and two-thirds. The quart cup is marked for quarter,\nhalf and three-quarters; each quarter being equal to one cupful.\n\n[Illustration: GLASS MEASURING CUPS]\n\n[Illustration: QUART MEASURE]\n\nThe housekeeper who becomes accustomed to using _exact_ measurements\nwill never return to the hit-or-miss plan, because she will be sure\nthat every time she mixes a drink or makes a syrup or a cream that it\nwill be just as she wishes it to be.\n\n[Illustration: HOUSEHOLD SCALES]\n\n\n\n\n                             WHAT TO DRINK\n\n\n                   I—FRUITADES, ICED, FRAPPÉ AND HOT\n\n\nThere are a number of things worth considering when serving drinks\nat home; first among these is the use of attractive glassware. Good\nlooking glasses cost no more than ugly ones, and clear fine glass\npolishes better than heavy blurred glass. And surely any drink is more\npleasing to the palate if the eye is pleased. Be sure that the glasses\nshine, and also ascertain that glasses meant to hold cold drinks are\nchilled. Almost all fruitades, no matter what the name or foundation,\ncontain lemon juice, so it is also well to remember that lemons\nintended for squeezing should be peeled, and that very carefully. While\nthe lemon peel, or the zest, rather, is an excellent flavor, it is\nnot satisfactory in lemonade, as there is a little bitterness when it\nstands, which displeases some people.\n\nMost of the recipes given for these fruitades are for individual\ndrinks, to make it easier for the hostess to ascertain how much to\nprepare if she knows the number of people to be served.\n\nA cocktail shaker, an ice shaver and a long handled spoon are almost\na necessity in making drinks. They are at least a great aid, and as\nnone of these things is expensive and all may be obtained in the\nhousekeeping department of any city shop, or in the hardware store in\nsmall towns, there seems no reason for not owning them.\n\nFruitades are delicious, refreshing and healthful, and surely not\ndifficult to make, so that the gracious hostess will serve these\ncooling drinks often.\n\nIf syrups are made and bottled one need not worry about serving a\ndelectable drink in a surprisingly short time.\n\n\nBASEBALL LEMONADE\n\nFor an individual drink, use:\n\n  1 egg,\n  1 lemon,\n  1 spoonful of sugar,\n  ¾ cupful of milk,\n  ½ cupful of water.\n\nPut the egg in the bottom of the tall glass; add the juice of a lemon,\na spoonful of sugar, a little ice, shaved fine, and the milk and water.\nPut into a shaker, shake well and serve.\n\n\nEGG LEMONADE\n\n  ½ cupful of finely shaved ice,\n  1 egg,\n  3 teaspoonfuls of powdered sugar,\n  ¾ cupful of water,\n    Juice of one lemon,\n    Carbonated water.\n\nUse either a large glass and a shaker-top, or a cocktail shaker. Place\nall the ingredients in the shaker except the carbonated water, shake\nwell, pour into an attractive glass, add the carbonated water, and\nserve.\n\n\nFRUIT LEMONADE\n\n  1 lemon,\n  1 slice of orange,\n  1 cherry,\n  1 slice of pineapple,\n  1 Malaga grape,\n  2 teaspoonfuls of sugar,\n    Shaved ice,\n    Water.\n\nPut the juice of the lemon, sugar, shaved or cracked ice, and water\nenough to make a glass full in a shaker, shake well, pour into a tall\nglass, and add the fruit and serve at once.\n\n\nGRAPE JUICE LEMONADE\n\n  3  lemons,\n  1  pint of grape juice,\n  1½ pints of water,\n  1  cupful of sugar.\n\nPlace a small square of ice in a tall glass pitcher; mix the lemon\njuice, sugar, water and grape juice together, pour into the pitcher;\nallow to become thoroughly chilled and serve.\n\n\nGINGER ALE LEMONADE\n\n  3  lemons,\n  1  pint of ginger ale,\n  1½ pints of water,\n  1  cupful of sugar.\n\nPlace a goodly sized piece of ice in a glass pitcher and pour over\nit the juice of the lemons, sugar and water, which should have been\nthoroughly mixed. Stir and when the sugar is dissolved, add the ginger\nale. This should be served without delay, while the “fizz” is still in\nthe ginger ale.\n\nIt is not at all necessary to use imported ginger ales, as there are\ndomestic makes which are equally as good.\n\n\nGRAPEFRUIT AND ORANGEADE\n\n  1 grapefruit,\n  2 oranges,\n  1 cupful of sugar,\n  1 pint of ginger ale,\n  1 pint of water,\n  1 pint of crushed ice,\n  1 full spray of mint.\n\nCut the grapefruit in half and extract the juice by using a large glass\norange juice extractor. Extract the orange juice, add sugar and allow\nto stand for an hour if possible, stirring occasionally. When ready to\nserve, add crushed ice, water and ginger ale, stir and add the spray of\nmint well crushed. Serve while it still has a sparkle.\n\n\nMINT GINGER ALE\n\n  1 pint of ginger ale,\n  1 lemon,\n  2 sprays of mint.\n\nFor this refreshing drink, crush the mint and put into a tall glass\npitcher, add the crushed ice, the juice of half a lemon and the thinly\nsliced second half. Add the ginger ale, stir with a long handled spoon\nand serve at once.\n\n\nORANGE GRAPEADE\n\n  1 orange,\n  ½ pint of chipped or shaved ice,\n  ½ pint of grape juice,\n    Sugar.\n\nExtract the juice from the orange and add to the grape juice, stir and\nadd the shaved ice. If not sweet enough add sugar to taste.\n\n\nLIMEADE\n\n  2  fresh limes,\n  1½ teaspoonfuls of sugar,\n     Spring or carbonated water,\n     Mint,\n     Ice.\n\nExtract the juice from the limes, put into a tall straight-sided glass\nand add sugar or plain syrup. If sugar is used, stir until the sugar is\ndissolved. Add water to fill the glass and stir, or carbonated water,\nand put a spray of mint into each service. Serve with a straw.\n\n\nLIMEADE WITH LIME SYRUP\n\n  ½ lemon,\n  2 tablespoonfuls of lime syrup,\n  2 tablespoonfuls of plain syrup,\n    Carbonated water or spring water,\n    Ice.\n\nExtract the juice from the half lemon, put into a tall glass, add lime\nsyrup and plain syrup and stir, then add the carbonated water, or\nspring water, if desired. Mint or a cherry may be added as liked.\n\n\nTEA-RHUBARBADE\n\n  6 stalks of young rhubarb,\n  1 lemon,\n  2 oranges,\n  1 quart of water,\n  1 pint of tea,\n    Sugar.\n\nWash the rhubarb and cut into inch lengths, add a quart of water and\nstew until tender; drain, and set the juice away to cool. (The pulp\nmay be used for tarts or marmalade.) Add a pint of tea to the strained\nrhubarb; extract the lemon juice and add this and the oranges thinly\nsliced. Sweeten to taste and pour over shaved ice in tall thin glasses.\n\n\nCRÉOLE “FROG” LEMONADE\n\n  2 dozen lemons,\n  1 pound of sugar,\n  2 quarts of water,\n  2 quarts of Seltzer,\n  1 pineapple,\n  3 dozen strawberries.\n\nUse a large punch bowl; put the sugar, lemon juice and water in it, and\nstir well until the sugar is dissolved; add the juice of one pineapple\nand the Seltzer water. Mix well again and add the strawberries, slices\nof pineapple and very thin slices of lemon. Place a large piece of ice\nin the center of the bowl, and allow to stand until very cold before\nserving.\n\n\nCANTON LEMONADE\n\n  ½  cupful of lemon juice,\n  1¼ cupfuls of sugar,\n  1  pint of water,\n  ½  teaspoonful of ground ginger.\n\nMix the sugar, ginger and water and boil until slightly syrup-like,\nthen add the lemon juice. Cool and dilute as desired, or bottle hot for\nuse when needed. Use two tablespoonfuls to a small glass of iced water\nwhen ready to serve.\n\n\nORANGE-LEMONADE\n\n  1 lemon,\n  1 quart of water,\n  3 oranges,\n  1 cupful of white grape juice,\n    Sugar.\n\nWash the oranges, and rub a cube of sugar over the skin of one orange;\ncut the oranges and extract the juice, adding just enough sugar to\nmake slightly sweet. To this add the juice of one lemon, stir, add the\nwater, then the grape juice and serve at once.\n\n\nPLAIN LEMONADE\n\n  ½  cupful of lemon juice,\n  1¼ cupfuls of sugar,\n  1  pint of water.\n\nBoil the water and sugar together until syrup-like; take from the fire\nand add the lemon juice. Cool and dilute as desired, the strength\ndepending upon the taste of those to be served. To dilute one may use\ncracked ice, iced water, or Apollinaris, or a mixture of water and\nApollinaris.\n\n\nAPOLLINARIS LEMONADE\n\n  2 tablespoonfuls of lemon juice,\n  ¾ teaspoonful of sugar,\n    Apollinaris,\n    Cracked ice.\n\nPut the lemon juice, sugar, cracked ice and Apollinaris in a shaker,\nshake for a minute, pour into a tall, thin glass and serve at once.\n\n\nWHITE GRAPE JUICE LEMONADE\n\n  1 pint of water,\n  1 lemon,\n  1 cupful of white grape juice,\n    Sugar,\n    Shaved ice.\n\nUsually the white grape juice is sweet enough to serve with the lemon\njuice without using sugar, depending always upon the person to be\nserved. Cut a lemon in two, extract the juice from half, and slice the\nother half very thin. Mix the lemon juice with the sugar, if any is\nto be used, first trying a teaspoonful, add the water, stir until the\nsugar is dissolved, add the grape juice and then the thinly sliced half\nlemon, stir and serve.\n\n\nORGEAT LEMONADE\n\n  1 tablespoonful of powdered sugar,\n  1 tablespoonful of orgeat syrup (see syrups)\n  ½ lemon,\n    Ice,\n    Berries.\n\nFill the shaker about one-third full of shaved ice, pour over it the\nsyrup and the lemon juice; fill to three-quarters full with water;\nshake, add any berries in season; pour into a thin tall glass and serve\nat once.\n\n\nRASPBERRY LEMONADE\n\n  1 quart of water,\n  1 lemon,\n  1 pint of raspberries,\n  ½ cupful of sugar,\n    Ice.\n\nSelect a half cupful of nice firm berries, and put aside, then crush\nthe remaining berries, and press through a fine cloth. Extract the\njuice from the lemon, add to the berry juice, add shaved ice, sugar and\nwater and shake well. Pour into a glass pitcher and add the selected\nwhole berries and serve.\n\n\nITALIAN LEMONADE\n\n  ½ lemon,\n  ½ orange,\n  1 teaspoonful of powdered sugar,\n  1 cupful of ice,\n  1 tablespoonful of white grape juice,\n    Fruits in season,\n  1 spoonful of ice cream.\n\nPut the juice of half a lemon and half an orange into a shaker with\nthe sugar and cracked ice and shake until the ice is well melted. Pour\ninto a tall thin glass, fill with iced water, stir, add small fruits in\nseason, and top with a teaspoonful of ice cream.\n\n\nSODA LEMONADE\n\n  ½ lemon,\n  1 teaspoonful of sugar,\n  ½ cupful of cracked ice,\n    Plain soda.\n\nPut the juice of half a lemon and the sugar into a tall glass with the\nice, stir with a long handled spoon, using the left hand; pour in the\nsoda with the right. Serve at once.\n\n\nSTRAWBERRY LEMONADE\n\n  ½ lemon,\n  1 teaspoonful of sugar,\n  1 dozen large strawberries,\n  ½ cupful of shaved ice,\n    Milk.\n\nFill a shaker about a third full of ice; (about a half cupful) add\nthe juice of a half lemon, the juice from a dozen strawberries, and\nthe sugar. Shake well, add enough milk to nearly fill the shaker, and\nstrain into a tall glass.\n\n\n            FRUITADES AND SODAS FROM JUICES OF CANNED FRUITS\n\nSo often when a can of strawberries is opened, we find there is an\nabundance of juice, more in fact than we care to use with the berries\non the table, and if the desired amount, _only_, is left with the\nfruit for table consumption, and the rest reserved, many combinations\nwhich are tasty and desirable may be made without the extra expense of\npurchasing fruits or prepared syrups.\n\nStrawberries are not the only berries from which the juice may be\ntaken, for blackberries and raspberries, both red and black, are\nequally desirable. Besides these berries, there is no good reason why\nthe juice from plums, pineapples, cherries and peaches may not be used\nto as good advantage.\n\n\nSTRAWBERRY SODA\n\n  Carbonated water,\n  Cream,\n  Strawberry juice or syrup.\n\nWe are more likely to have iced tea glasses in our homes than the\nregulation soda glasses, and for that reason I advise using them in\npreparing a home-made soda.\n\nPour enough strawberry juice into a glass to fill it one-third full,\nadd three tablespoonfuls of thick cream, and fill with carbonated water.\n\n\nBLACKBERRYADE\n\n  ¼ glass of blackberry juice,\n  1 teaspoonful of lemon juice,\n  1 teaspoonful of powdered sugar,\n    Cracked ice,\n    Water.\n\nPut the one-fourth glassful (iced tea glass) of blackberry juice, the\nlemon juice, sugar and cracked ice into a cocktail shaker and shake\nwell for a minute or two. Pour into the glass and add enough water to\nfill the glass seven-eighths full; stir well and serve at once.\n\n\nRASPBERRYADE\n\n  ¼ glass of raspberry juice,\n  ½ teaspoonful of lemon juice,\n  1 teaspoonful of powdered sugar,\n    Cracked ice,\n    Water.\n\nPour the raspberry juice, lemon juice, sugar and cracked ice into a\nshaker—using an iced tea glass as a measuring medium—and shake well;\npour into the iced tea glass and fill with water. Stir and serve.\n\n\nLEMON FROTH\n\n  1 egg white,\n    Lemon syrup (see lemonade),\n  ¾ cupful of water,\n  1 candied cherry.\n\nTo three-quarters of a cup of water add one-third cupful of finely\ncracked ice and lemon syrup enough to please the taste of the person to\nbe served: shake well for two minutes, strain into a tall thin glass—an\niced tea glass is a desirable type—and stir in the stiffly beaten white\nof an egg. Top with a thin slice of lemon and a candied cherry.\n\n\nSTRAWBERRY-LEMON FROTH\n\n  1 egg white,\n  ½ lemon,\n  ¾ cupful of water,\n    Cracked ice,\n  2 teaspoonfuls of sugar,\n  ½ dozen strawberries.\n\nReserve the largest berry and crush the others; press through a fine\nsieve. Extract the juice from half a lemon, add to the strawberry juice\nand stir in the sugar. Continue to stir until the sugar is dissolved.\nPour this into a cocktail shaker, adding the finely cracked ice and\nwater. Shake hard for two minutes, strain into a tall glass, stir in\nthe stiffly beaten white of an egg and top with the selected strawberry.\n\n\nHOT LEMONADE\n\n  ½  lemon,\n  3  teaspoonfuls of sugar,\n  1¼ cupfuls of boiling water.\n\nExtract the juice from the half lemon, add the sugar and then the hot\nwater. Stir until the sugar is dissolved and serve.\n\n\nHOT SPICED LEMONADE\n\n  ½  lemon,\n  3  teaspoonfuls of sugar,\n  1¼ cupfuls of boiling water,\n  ⅛  teaspoonful of ground ginger.\n\nExtract the juice from the half lemon, add the sugar and ginger; strain\nand add the boiling water. Stir until the sugar is dissolved and serve.\n\n\n                                FRAPPÉS\n\nAny one of the fruitades may be made into a frappé with so little\ntrouble that in hot weather there is no reason why the hostess should\nnot serve these cooling, delectable drinks at a moment’s notice. There\nare always syrups which may be kept in the refrigerator and mixed with\nlemon syrup, a little water or carbonated water added, poured over the\nshaved ice in a sherbet glass, and presto! the frappé is ready to serve.\n\nIt is also possible to freeze the frappé, and it is advisable if one\nis to serve a goodly number. Remember always that a frappé is only\npartially frozen. As the liquid begins to thicken, scrape it from the\nsides of the freezer, using a long knife, preferably a spatula. It\nwould seem impossible to keep house without a spatula, because of the\nmany uses to which it may be put.\n\n\nLEMON-RASPBERRY FRAPPÉ\n\n    Shaved ice,\n  1 tablespoonful of lemon syrup (see lemonade),\n  1 tablespoonful of raspberry juice.\n\nThis is only enough for one service. Fill a sherbet glass\nthree-quarters full of finely shaved ice and pour over it the lemon\nsyrup and raspberry juice. Serve at once. This may be served at the\nbeginning of a meal in hot weather, or served at any time when any\ncooling drink is wanted.\n\n\nBLACKBERRY FRAPPÉ\n\n    Shaved ice,\n  2 tablespoonfuls of blackberry juice,\n    Sugar.\n\nFill the sherbet glasses three-quarters full of shaved ice, and pour\nthe blackberry juice over after having been mixed with sugar enough\nto take away the decided acid taste. It is not wise to make any drink\nwhich is meant to be cooling, too sweet.\n\n\nWHITE GRAPE JUICE FRAPPÉ\n\n    Shaved ice,\n  ¼ teaspoonful of lemon syrup,\n  2 tablespoonfuls of white grape juice.\n\nFill the glass,—a sherbet or tall champagne glass—with finely shaved\nice, and pour over it the grape juice and lemon syrup (see lemonade).\nServe at once.\n\n\nTEA FRAPPÉ\n\n  2  teaspoonfuls of tea,\n  1½ pints of boiling water,\n  4  teaspoonfuls of sugar,\n  2  tablespoonfuls of lemon juice.\n\nUse a large teapot, rinsing it out with boiling water, then place the\ntea in the pot and pour a pint and a half of boiling water over. Allow\nto stand for five minutes, and strain off. Cool, add the sugar and the\nlemon juice and freeze to a mush. Serve in sherbet glasses with a mint\nleaf, if mint is in season.\n\n\nPINEAPPLE FRAPPÉ\n\n  1 pineapple,\n  1 cupful of sugar,\n  1 lemon,\n  1 quart of water.\n\nPeel the pineapple, remove the “eyes,” and holding the pines in the\nleft hand slash both ways,—up and down, as well as across,—then cut\naway from the stalk-like center. One may crush more thoroughly by\nputting through a food chopper, or by using a large wooden spoon.\nExtract as much juice as possible, and add to the sugar and lemon\njuice. Stir, add the water, which should be boiling. Allow to cool,\nfreeze until a mush, and serve. Remember always that a frappé is\n_right_ when it is just at the pouring stage, and not frozen a bit\nharder.\n\n\nSTRAWBERRY FRAPPÉ\n\n  1  quart of strawberries,\n  1  lemon,\n  1  quart of water,\n  1½ cupfuls of sugar.\n\nCrush the strawberries, press through a fine sieve, add the sugar and\nlemon juice; add the water, which should be boiling. Set aside to cool;\npour into the freezer and freeze, until a soft pourable mush. Serve in\ntall champagne glasses and top with a selected strawberry.\n\n\nCOFFEE FRAPPÉ\n\n    Whipped cream,\n  2 level tablespoonfuls of powdered coffee,\n  1 cupful of boiling water,\n  2 teaspoonfuls of sugar,\n    Shaved ice.\n\nPowder the coffee, put in the bag of a drip pot and pour the cupful of\nboiling water over it. Allow this to drip, add the sugar and stir until\ndissolved. Put into the refrigerator and when ready to serve, pour two\ntablespoonfuls over the shaved ice in the sherbet glass. The glass\nshould be about three-quarters full, which allows space for the coffee.\nTop with a generous spoonful of whipped cream.\n\n\n                          EASILY MADE FRAPPÉS\n\nIt may not be known to all housekeepers that fruit syrups may be\npurchased at very reasonable prices from the better grocers, but it is\ntrue, and with these syrups and shaved ice a frappé may be made in a\nminute.\n\n\nRASPBERRY FRAPPÉ\n\n  Shaved ice,\n  Raspberry syrup.\n\nFill the sherbet glasses about three-quarters full with finely shaved\nice, and pour over it two tablespoonfuls of raspberry syrup. Serve at\nonce.\n\n\nSTRAWBERRY FRAPPÉ\n\n  Shaved ice,\n  Strawberry syrup.\n\nIf one owns a supply of attractive glasses, one can always make drinks\n_look_ differently at least, and one’s appetite is always grateful for\na change, even a change in the type of glasses used.\n\nI would suggest if one has tall thin glasses of the type of parfait\nglasses, using them for a change.\n\nFill until about a quarter way from the top with shaved ice, and pour\nover four tablespoonfuls of strawberry syrup. Serve immediately.\n\n\nGRENADINE FRAPPÉ\n\n    Shaved ice,\n    Grenadine,\n  ½ teaspoonful of lemon juice.\n\nUse a long stemmed, tall glass, filling it three-quarters full with\nshaved ice.

Serve in champagne glasses.\n\n\n                           ECONOMICAL FRAPPÉS\n\nThere are many times when a small amount of juice from either canned or\npreserved fruits is left from the table serving, although all the fruit\nmay have been used, and there is no reason why this juice should not be\nused to good advantage in frappés. One should remember always that the\nsyrup from preserved fruits is much heavier, and in consequence would\nbe somewhat too sweet to use as it came from the fruit unless a little\nacid were added to it. So, when using the syrup of preserves add lemon\njuice and the frappé will be much more acceptable and refreshing.\n\n\nPEACH FRAPPÉ\n\n    Shaved ice,\n  1 teaspoonful of lemon juice,\n  2 tablespoonfuls of syrup from preserved peaches.\n\nUse a sherbet glass and fill three-quarters full with shaved ice; pour\nover this the syrup from the peaches which should have been mixed with\nthe lemon juice. Serve as soon as prepared.\n\n\nCHERRY FRAPPÉ\n\nIf the cherries have been canned with a thin syrup it may be used just\nas it is taken from the fruit. It will need neither sugar nor lemon\njuice.\n\n    Shaved ice,\n  3 tablespoonfuls of cherry juice.\n\nFill the sherbet glass three-quarters full of ice and pour over the\njuice or light syrup from the canned cherries. Serve immediately.\n\n\n\n\n              II—FRUIT PUNCHES, FRUIT CUPS AND FRUIT BOWLS\n\n\nThe art of mixing a satisfying punch is not at all as mystifying as it\nis often thought to be. To mix enough for a number of guests one should\nown a punch bowl, and while one may spend almost any amount of money\non such a thing, there are very inexpensive pressed glass bowls to be\npurchased. It is always advisable to select the very plainest style one\ncan find. One of the better pressed glass bowls is in the desirable\ncolonial pattern and will be found to be most satisfactory.\n\n\nAPPLEBLOOM PUNCH\n\n  1 pint of sweet cider,\n  1 pint of Apollinaris,\n  1 pint of white grape juice,\n    Ice.\n\nPlace a square of ice in the punch bowl and pour the sweet cider and\nwhite grape juice over it, allow this to become very cold, and last\npour the Apollinaris over.

When ready to\nserve place a square of ice in the punch bowl and strain the liquid\nover; add a cupful of red raspberries and a quart of commercial cider\nof the sparkling type.

The punch should be served as soon as ready.\n\n\nCIDER PUNCH\n\n  2 quarts of sweet cider,\n  ½ pint of loganberry juice,\n  3 lemons,\n  3 oranges,\n  2 cupfuls of sugar,\n  3 pints of carbonated water.\n\nAs loganberry juice is tart more sugar is seemingly needed than when\ngrape juice is used, but it is far better to err on the other side and\nserve a punch too tart rather than too sweet. It is always wise to\ntaste any drink one is preparing.\n\nPeel the lemons and extract the juice, extract the juice from two of\nthe oranges and mix with the Loganberry juice and sugar and pour into\nthe punch bowl, in which a large piece of ice should have been placed.\nSlice the third orange very thin and place in the bowl.

It may be made of fruits, of vegetables,\nof both fruits and vegetables, or of liquids, as one wishes. Most\ncocktails served at the home table will doubtless be made of fresh\nfruits, but the housekeeper will find that there are a number of\ncombinations of fruits and vegetables which will be quite acceptable to\nher family and guests.\n\nThere are several things to remember when making a cocktail; one of\nwhich is, always use attractive glasses and be sure that they shine.\nHave the ingredients quite cold and by no means make them too sweet,\nfor if they lose the tartness, the best effect is lost.\n\nThe more attractive the cocktail _looks_, the more appetizing it will\nprove to be.\n\n\nCUCUMBER COCKTAIL\n\nFor individual portion use the following:\n\n  2 tablespoonfuls of peeled, chopped cucumber,\n  ½ teaspoonful of grated horse-radish,\n  ¼ teaspoonful of chopped onion,\n  1 teaspoonful of chopped celery,\n  ½ teaspoonful of chopped radish (not peeled),\n    Salt,\n    French dressing,\n    Paprika.\n\nChop the cucumber, celery, onion and radish; mix with the horse-radish,\nand salt to taste.

Heat slowly to the boiling point, skim, allow\nto boil five minutes and then bottle while hot. Seal the corks with\nparaffin or sealing wax.\n\n\n                              FRUIT WATERS\n\nFruit waters are prepared shortly before they are to be used, are not\nbottled and stored as are syrups. So it is necessary to make these\nwaters only when the fruit to be used is in season.\n\n\nCHERRY WATER\n\n  2 pounds of cherries,\n  1 lemon,\n  ½ pound of sugar.\n\nStone the cherries, mash the pulp well, using a porcelain vessel; add\na cupful of distilled water (or rain water if it is possible to obtain\nit fresh and clear), and the juice of one lemon.

Into a claret\nglass of crushed ice put two teaspoonfuls of the juice, or into a small\nglass of iced water, put two tablespoonfuls of the juice.\n\n\n\n\n                        V—SYRUPS—FRUIT AND PLAIN\n\n\nAs many delightful drinks are made with either plain or fruit syrup\nas the foundation, I shall give a number of recipes for making these,\nleaving the housekeeper to decide which she prefers.\n\n\nPLAIN SYRUP\n\nThe following recipe is one used by a man famous for his ability in\nmixing drinks:\n\n  6½ pounds of loaf sugar,\n  ½  gallon of water,\n  1  egg white.\n\nBoil the sugar, water and egg white together until the sugar is\nthoroughly dissolved; filter through flannel, bottle and seal.\n\nNote: When using a flannel bag, wring it out of very hot water before\nusing, being sure that it is as dry as you can make it. In this way\nthere will be very little loss of syrup.\n\n\nPLAIN SYRUP No. 2\n\n  1½ quarts of water,\n  2  pounds of loaf sugar.\n\nThis recipe is also one used by a well-known mixer of drinks.\n\nPut the sugar and water over the fire in an enameled kettle; allow\nit to boil slowly; stirring occasionally. Skim well, and strain into\nbottles and seal.\n\n\nPLAIN SYRUP (CRÉOLE RECIPE)\n\n  2  pounds of sugar,\n  1½ pints of water.\n\nCook the sugar and water until the syrup snaps instantly if placed\nbetween the fingers and the fingers are immersed in cold water. Allow\nthis to become somewhat cool, bottle and seal.\n\n\nPLAIN SYRUP (OLD RECIPE)\n\nThe recipe reads: “To every large teacupful of water, add a pound of\nsugar.” It would seem wiser in this day to use one _measuring_ cupful\nof water to each pound of granulated sugar, if one cares to use this\nrecipe. For what one might consider a large cup someone else might\nthink rather small.\n\nThe recipe directs that “as the sugar and water begins to heat, stir\nit often, and when it rises towards the top of the kettle, put in\nanother cupful of water; repeating this process two or three times.”\nIf the syrup is not clear, and a scum arises, we are told “to skim it\ncarefully, and strain into bottles.”\n\n\nPLAIN SYRUP (QUICKLY MADE)\n\n  4 pounds of granulated sugar,\n  1 quart of cold water,\n  1 egg white.\n\nPut the sugar in a porcelain kettle, add the stiffly beaten white of\none egg, and the quart of water; stir until the sugar is thoroughly\ndissolved. Put over the fire and simmer for five minutes, skim, strain\nthrough a flannel bag, bottle and seal. It is always well to make a\nsmall quantity, for in that way one is assured that there will be no\nspoilage.\n\nWhen using a flannel bag, be sure to wring it very dry from hot water,\nby so doing insuring the least loss of syrup.\n\n\nGUM SYRUP\n\nSometimes one reads a recipe in which “gum” is used, and unless one is\ninitiated one is not apt to know what is required.\n\n  3½ pounds of loaf sugar,\n  2  quarts of water.\n\nBoil together for five minutes, strain and bottle.\n\n\nAPRICOT SYRUP (CRÉOLE RECIPE)\n\n  3 pints of apricot juice,\n  1 quart of plain syrup (use Créole recipe for plain syrup),\n  1 teaspoonful of extract of apricot.\n\nPeel and stone the apricots, cut into small pieces, mash well, cover\nwith a linen cloth, and set them on the ice in a stone or porcelain\njar for thirty-six hours. Then strain through a bag, pressing out all\nthe juice possible. Heat the plain syrup until the boiling point is\nreached, add the apricot juice and boil hard for five minutes. Take\nfrom the fire and allow to become nearly cold; add the extract, bottle\nand keep in a cool place.\n\n\nAPRICOT SYRUP\n\n  1 pint of apricot juice,\n  1 pound of sugar.\n\nPeel and cut into pieces as many apricots as one wishes to use, put\ninto a porcelain kettle with a little water—enough to barely cover the\nbottom of the kettle; crack a few of the apricot stones and add to the\nfruit and water. Boil slowly for fifteen minutes, strain through a\nflannel bag. To each pint of juice use one pound of sugar, return to\nthe kettle and boil for five minutes. Pour into hot bottles and seal.\n\n\nBLACKBERRY SYRUP (CRÉOLE RECIPE)\n\n  3 pints of blackberry juice,\n  1 quart of plain syrup.\n\nLook the blackberries over very carefully, wash, stem and mash; cover\ncarefully with a cloth and set on ice for thirty-six hours. Strain\nthrough a bag, pressing out all the juice possible. Heat the plain\nsyrup to the boiling point and add the blackberry juice, boil for five\nminutes, remove from the fire and allow to become nearly cool; bottle\nand seal. Put in a cool place when storing.\n\n\nBLACKBERRY SYRUP\n\n  1 pint of blackberry juice,\n  1 pound of granulated sugar,\n  1 ounce of cider vinegar,\n  4 whole cloves,\n  ⅛ teaspoonful of cinnamon,\n  ⅛ teaspoonful of ground mace.\n\nSelect perfectly ripe blackberries, wash, mash and put on the ice in a\ncarefully covered jar for twenty-four hours. It is well to cover the\nberries with a linen cloth. At the end of that time, press through a\nbag, and to each pint of juice add one pound of granulated sugar, one\nounce of cider vinegar, four whole cloves, an eighth teaspoonful of\ncinnamon and an eighth teaspoonful of mace. Bring to the boiling point\nand allow it to boil for five minutes, strain into hot bottles and\nseal. When cold, store in a cool place.\n\n\nCHERRY SYRUP\n\n  1 pint of cherry juice,\n  1 pound of granulated sugar.\n\nMash enough washed and stemmed cherries to make a pint of juice; let\nthe mashed cherries stand on ice for twenty-four hours.

Mash them, using a mortar, if\npossible, or an earthen dish; continue to crush and mash, adding a\nfew drops of water and a little of the zest of the lemon, until the\nmixture is pastelike. Moisten this paste with half of the soft water,\nand squeeze as much as possible through a firm bag. Return the paste to\nthe dish and add the rest of the water, stir, put into the bag again\nand again press all through the bag that is possible.\n\nBring the plain syrup to the boiling point; remove from the fire, stir\nthe almond milk in thoroughly, return to the fire and bring again to\nthe boiling point, allowing it to boil for five minutes. When cool,\nadd the orange flower water; stir well, being sure that it is well\nblended. Strain again, and place in bottles; seal and store. It is\nwell, however, to watch this and shake the bottles once in a while,\nespecially if the almond oil has risen to the top.\n\n\nORANGE FLOWER SYRUP\n\n  1  pint of orange flower water,\n  1½ pounds of granulated sugar.\n\nPut the sugar into a porcelain kettle with the orange flower water,\nstir until the sugar is dissolved, place on the fire and slowly bring\nto the boiling point.

These may be crushed and pressed either by hand or in an\nordinary cider mill. If light colored juice is desired, the crushed\ngrapes are put in a clean, well washed cloth sack and either hung up\nand twisted or grasped by two persons, one at either end, and twisted\nuntil the greater part of the juice is expressed. Then, in a double\nboiler or its equivalent, such as a large stone jar placed in a pan of\nhot water, so that the juice does not come in direct contact with the\nfire, the juice is gradually heated to a temperature of 180° to 200°\nF. The temperature should never be allowed to go over 200° F. It is\nbest to use a thermometer; if none is available, however, the juice\nmay be heated until it steams, but it should not be allowed to boil.\nIt should be poured immediately into a glass or enameled vessel and\nallowed to settle for 24 hours; then the juice should be drained from\nthe sediment and run through several thicknesses of clean flannel or\nthrough a conic filter made from woolen cloth or felt and fixed to a\nhoop of iron, so that it can be suspended wherever necessary. The juice\nis then poured into clean bottles, space being left at the top for the\nliquid to expand when heated. A good home substitute for the commercial\npasteurizer is an ordinary wash boiler with a thin board fitted over\nthe bottom on which the filled bottles are set. Ordinary glass fruit\njars serve the same purpose equally well. The tubs should be filled\nwith water within an inch or so of the tops of the bottles and heated\nuntil the water begins to simmer. The bottles should be taken out and\nsealed or corked immediately. Only new corks that have just been soaked\nin a temperature of about 140° F. should be used. It is well to take\nthe further precaution of sealing the corks with paraffin or sealing\nwax to prevent the entrance of mold germs.\n\nWhen red juice is desired, crushed grapes should first be heated to a\ntemperature of not more than 200° F.; then strained through a clean\ncloth or drip bag, no pressure being used, and set away to cool and\nsettle. The remaining procedure is the same for the red as for the\nlight colored juice. Many people do not even take the trouble to let\nthe juice settle after it is strained, simply reheating and sealing the\nvessels and setting them away in an upright position in a cool place\nwhere they will be undisturbed. If bottles are used, the corks should\nbe sterilized and the necks of the bottles sealed with sealing wax. The\njuice settles, and when desired for use the clear liquid is poured off\nthe sediment.\n\nAny person familiar with the process of canning fruit can put up grape\njuice, for the principles involved are the same. Care should be taken\nnot to sterilize the juice at a temperature higher than 195° F.; or the\nfinished product will have a scorched taste. The bottles or jars should\nnot be so large that when they are opened the juice will spoil before\nit can be used. Unfermented grape juice, properly made and bottled,\nwill keep indefinitely if not exposed to the atmosphere or to infection\nof mold germs; when a bottle is once open, however, the contents, like\ncanned goods generally, should be used as soon as possible. Unfermented\njuice may be made not only from all varieties of grapes, but also from\nsome other fruits, such as apples, pears and cherries. Some berries\nalso yield excellent juices.\n\n\n                           GRAPE JUICE No. 2\n\nCrush the grapes in a clean kettle with a wooden spoon and put them in\na cloth sack or jelly bag. Twist the sack or press it until the juice\nhas all come out. Put the juice in a double boiler over hot water until\nit steams. If a kettle is used, great care must be taken that the juice\ndoes not boil. Let the juice stand in an enamel kettle for 24 hours to\nsettle. Run it through a flannel jelly bag and put into clean bottles.\nLeave space in bottle for the liquid to expand. Put the bottle in a\nsterilizer and fill the sterilizer with cold water until within an inch\nof the top of the bottles. Heat the water slowly until it is nearly\nsimmering, take the bottles out and insert clean corks, and, as a final\nprecaution it is advisable to dip the top of the cork in sealing wax or\nparaffin.\n\nThis makes a light colored juice. For a red juice, the grapes may be\nheated until just before the boiling point as in the first part of the\nprocess. It is not necessary to allow the juice to settle but it is\nmuch clearer if you do.\n\n                               ROOT BEERS\n\nGINGER BEER\n\n  2  ounces of ginger root,\n  2  ounces of cream of tartar,\n  1  lemon,\n  1½ pounds of granulated sugar,\n  ¼  cake of compressed yeast.\n\nPlace the ginger in a large bowl, bruise and pound thoroughly; add\nboiling water, then the grated rind of the lemon and when stirred in,\nadd the juice of the lemon. Now mix in the cream of tartar and the\nsugar; stir well, allow to cool until lukewarm; add the yeast which\nshould have been dissolved in a little warm water. Mix all together,\ncover tightly and allow to stand for six hours. At the end of that\ntime, strain and put into bottles having patent tops, unless one has a\ncommercial “topper” which is most desirable. Keep in a cool place, for\nif kept warm or not securely corked the beer will effervesce.\n\n\nENGLISH GINGER BEER\n\nThis interesting recipe dates back to about 1840.\n\n  1½ ounces of ginger,\n  4  quarts of boiling water,\n  1  ounce of cream of tartar,\n  1  pound of sugar,\n  2  lemons,\n  1  cupful of yeast.\n\nPour the boiling water upon the ginger and the sugar (either brown or\ngranulated may be used) add two lemons thinly sliced. Into this pour\none cupful of good yeast and allow it to stand for twenty-four hours.\nPour off carefully and put into bottles.\n\n\nMAPLE BEER\n\n  4 gallons of boiling water,\n  1 quart of pure maple syrup,\n  1 tablespoonful of essence of spruce,\n  1 pint of yeast.\n\nThis recipe too, dates back to 1840.\n\nPut in a large container, one quart of pure maple syrup, and add\none gallon of boiling water and the spruce essence; allow this to\nstand until lukewarm, then add a pint of yeast, allowing it to stand\ntwenty-four hours. Pour off carefully and bottle and seal.\n\n\nROOT BEER\n\n  ½ cupful of commercial root beer extract,\n  5 pounds of sugar,\n  5 gallons of rain water,\n  ¾ cake of compressed yeast.\n\nDissolve the yeast cake in a little warm water; mix the sugar and root\nbeer extract together and add the water, which should be hot; allow\nthis to stand until lukewarm and add the yeast cake; mix well, allow to\nsettle and pour into bottles. If one owns patent top bottles they are\neasily handled. Fasten the stopper and store where it is cool. The beer\nwill be ready for use after twenty-four hours.\n\nIt is not at all necessary to put this beer up in such quantities; just\ndivide or subdivide the recipe.\n\n\nSPRUCE BEER (CRÉOLE RECIPE)\n\n  2 quarts of water,\n  ½ ounce of hops,\n  ½ teaspoonful of ginger,\n  ½ pint of Louisiana molasses,\n  4 tablespoonfuls of yeast,\n    Sprigs of spruce.\n\nGather a handful of spruce sprigs, break and bruise, and steep in a\nlittle water until a strong essence is made.\n\nPour the water over the hops and the ginger and allow to boil; strain\nand add the molasses and essence of spruce. Cool until lukewarm and add\nthe yeast. Cover tightly and stand away for twenty-four hours. Pour off\ncarefully and bottle. Seal and store in a cool place. In two days the\nbeer is ready for use.\n\nOne may gather the spruce sprigs as directed, or purchase the extract\nor essence of spruce, or steep the spruce gum.\n\n\nBIRCH BEER\n\n  ¼ pound of black birch bark,\n  ½ ounce of hops,\n  1 teaspoonful of ginger,\n  ½ compressed yeast cake,\n  1 pint of corn syrup,\n  3 quarts of water (soft or rain water).\n\nBoil the birch bark in a quart of water until reduced a third; strain\nand set aside until the hops, syrup and ginger has boiled for twenty\nminutes. Strain and mix with the birch extract; when cooled until about\nlukewarm add the yeast cake dissolved in a little warm water. Cover\ntightly and stand away for twenty-four hours. Strain into bottles and\ncork well.\n\n\nCIDER\n\nIt would seem unnecessary labor to make cider at home, unless, of\ncourse one lives on a farm and has many apples to dispose of after the\nselected apples are shipped or stored for winter use. And even in that\nevent one is likely to take the apples to a community cider mill. But\nif there should be a time when one of my readers cares to try cider\nmaking at home it may be done with utensils found in every kitchen.\n\nBe sure that there are no bruised or rotted spots on the apples to be\nused and wipe them carefully with a damp cloth. Cut them in pieces and\nrun through a food grinder, placing a deep dish where it will catch\n_all_ of the juice. Place a fine cloth in a colander; pile the apple\npomace (the ground apple) in it and pour all the juice in too. Fold the\ncloth over and place a heavy weight on top, pressing it often. When the\njuice or cider is pressed out, bottle and use. It should not be kept,\nas it becomes sour very quickly.\n\nIt is probably as economical to purchase the sweet cider as to use the\ntime and the necessary apples to make the cider.\n\n\nTO KEEP CIDER SWEET AND SPARKLING\n\n(Date of recipe, 1845)\n\nLet the new sweet cider ferment from one to three weeks according to\nwhether the weather is cool or warm, longer if cool or one week if\nwarm. When it has attained a lively fermentation, add to each gallon,\naccording to its acidity, from one half to two pounds of sugar, and\nallow it to again ferment until the desired sweetness is reached.\nPour out one quart of the cider and add for each gallon one-quarter\nounce of sulphite of lime (anti-chloride). Stir the powder and cider\nuntil thoroughly mixed and return to the rest of the cider. Agitate\nwell and briskly for a few minutes and then let the cider settle. The\nfermentation will cease at once. After a few days draw off the clear\ncider, bottle carefully, and cork well. Bottles with patent stoppers\nwill be found most satisfactory.\n\n\nTO BOIL CIDER\n\n(Old New England recipe)\n\nUse perfectly sweet cider, preferably not over two days old: boil until\nboiled down about half. Skim often, pour into hot bottles and cork\ntightly. Store in a cool place.\n\nThis may be used for drinks, by stirring two tablespoonfuls into a\nglassful of iced water.\n\n\n\n\n             VII—COLD MILK DRINKS, HOT MILK AND BUTTERMILK\n\n\n                       SHAKES, NOGGS AND PUNCHES\n\nWhile many do not care for milk as a drink, still milk in combination\nwith syrups, eggs, malted milk, flavoring extracts or fruit juices will\nbe found pleasing even to those who would not drink it plain. When one\nconsiders the amount of nourishment furnished by a glass of milk, it is\nwell to serve it when possible, even disguised as a nogg or punch.\n\n\nCHOCOLATE MILK\n\n  1 cupful of milk,\n  ⅛ cupful of chocolate syrup (see syrups) (2 tablespoonfuls),\n    Ice.\n\nUse a cocktail shaker, put two tablespoonfuls of cracked ice in the\nshaker, add the chocolate syrup and the milk; shake well, strain into\na tall glass and serve.

Serve with a straw and a long handled spoon.\n\n\nVICHY AND MILK\n\n  ¾ cupful of rich milk,\n    Vichy.\n\nPour three-quarters cupful of rich milk in an iced tea glass and fill\nwith vichy.\n\nPhysicians order this for patients who cannot take, or who do not like\nmilk plain, and find that in most cases the patient can take it.\n\n\nMILK AND VICHY WITH SYRUP\n\n  ¾ cupful of milk,\n  2 tablespoonfuls of raspberry syrup (home-made or commercial),\n    Vichy.\n\nPour the syrup into a tall glass (iced tea glass is the right size) and\nadd the milk; stir well and fill the glass with vichy. The raspberry\nsyrup will disguise both the milk taste and the vichy, in case one does\nnot like either.\n\n\n                            HOT MILK DRINKS\n\n\nHOT MILK\n\nFor the person who is tired and who does not like plain cold milk, try\nheating the milk until just below the boiling point, adding a goodly\nsized pinch of salt and a generous sprinkling of paprika. Serve with a\nsaltine or a toasted cracker.\n\n\nHOT MILK WITH CELERY SALT\n\nHeat the milk until just below the boiling point, add a generous pinch\nof salt and a sprinkling of celery salt; stir well and serve with\ntoasted crackers.\n\n\nHOT MALTED MILK\n\n  2 teaspoonfuls of malted milk,\n  1 teaspoonful of sugar,\n  ⅛ teaspoonful of salt,\n  1 cupful of milk.\n\nBlend the malted milk with enough hot water to make it smooth, add the\nsalt and sugar, stirring thoroughly and add the cupful of milk, which\nshould have been heated until just below the boiling point.\n\n\nHOT MALTED MILK WITH CHOCOLATE\n\n  2 teaspoonfuls of malted milk,\n  2 tablespoonfuls of chocolate syrup,\n  1 cupful of milk.\n\nBlend the malted milk with a little hot water; stir until smooth; add\nthe chocolate syrup, stir, and add the milk which should be heated\nuntil just before the boiling point is reached.\n\n\nHOT MALTED MILK WITH COFFEE\n\n  2 teaspoonfuls of malted milk,\n  2 tablespoonfuls of strong dripped coffee,\n  2 teaspoonfuls of sugar,\n  1 cupful of milk.\n\nBlend the malted milk with enough hot water to make smooth, add the\nsugar and stir until well mixed, add the coffee and the milk heated\nuntil the boiling point is reached.\n\nCoffee syrup may be used if desired. Use two tablespoonfuls, but do not\nuse sugar with it.\n\n\nBUTTERMILK\n\nButtermilk as a beverage is to be greatly desired because of its food\nvalue as well as the fact that it is a most refreshing drink.\n\nThe food content is very high, having nearly all the food materials\nfound in whole milk, excepting, of course, the butter fats, which have\nbeen removed by churning; still some fats do remain; especially is this\ntrue of buttermilk obtained direct from such farmers as do not use the\nmost advanced methods of butter-making.\n\nWe find 3 per cent. of protein, nearly 5 per cent. of carbohydrates\nin the form of milk sugar, 0.7 per cent. of mineral constituents, and\nabout 0.5 per cent. of fats.\n\nButtermilk is recommended by many successful physicians as an aid in\nintestinal disorders.\n\nButtermilk is served at most soda fountains, and may be ordered from\none’s dairyman, also may be obtained at some grocers’ and at all better\nclass hotels.\n\n\nBUTTERMILK LEMONADE\n\nFor persons not caring for buttermilk plain, one may make a lemonade\nwhich is healthful as well as delicious.\n\n  1 quart of buttermilk,\n  2 lemons,\n  2 tablespoonfuls of sugar.\n\nExtract the juice of the lemons, add the sugar and stir until\ndissolved; add the buttermilk, stirring constantly. If a smaller\nquantity is to be made it were well to use a shaker, for then the\nlemonade will be so thoroughly mixed that the results will be most\nsatisfactory.\n\n\n“LACTO”\n\nThe following recipe is taken from a bulletin issued by the Iowa\nAgricultural Experiment Station.\n\n  2  quarts of buttermilk,\n  2  pounds of sugar,\n  2  eggs,\n  1⅔ cupfuls of orange juice,\n  ½  cupful of lemon juice.\n\nDissolve the sugar in the buttermilk and add the eggs, yolks and whites\nbeaten separately. Stir and strain the mixture and add the fruit\njuices. Freeze as for ice cream, and pack in ice for an hour before\nserving.\n\n\n\n\n                 VIII—COFFEE, CHOCOLATE, COCOA AND TEA\n\n\nA book of beverage recipes which did not give directions for making\ncoffee, tea and cocoa would surely fail in its mission.\n\nI have given recipes from many countries, and by many men famous for\ncoffee making, feeling sure that each reader will find the exact one to\nplease the fancy of himself or herself and family.\n\n\nCOFFEE\n\nEven though we as Americans are coffee drinkers to almost an alarming\ndegree, it is not often that we find a cook who really makes excellent\ncoffee.\n\nWhen purchasing coffee one must be influenced by one’s taste; whether\nall Java, whether equal parts of Mocha and Java, or whether a blend of\none’s own or a commercial blend is used.\n\nOne thing should be remembered, and that is: good coffee is served as\nsoon as it is made.\n\nThe pot should always be hot before the coffee is made.\n\nThe late Francis B. Thurber, a coffee importer, who made coffee a study\nboth as it came to this country and as it was grown in its native\nstate, gives the following recipe as his idea of unexcelled coffee:\n\nTo one cupful of coffee ground moderately fine add one egg with shell,\nand enough cold water to wet the grounds. Pour on one pint of boiling\nwater and let it boil for fifteen minutes. Remove the pot from the fire\nand allow it to stand for three minutes to settle, then strain into a\nwarm coffee pot. Serve in cups half filled with boiling milk, or if\ncream is used dilute with hot water.\n\n\nFRENCH DRIP COFFEE\n\nFor _cafe noir_ use two tablespoonfuls of finely ground coffee for each\ncup. Coffee should be packed tightly as possible in the upper part of\nthe French pot, and the boiling water poured through. When this has\ndripped through, redrip and serve.\n\nParisian housekeepers, before throwing out the grounds, pour boiling\nwater through the coffee again, reserving this for use the next time\ncoffee is made.\n\nMuch of the flavor of French coffee is said to be due to this practice.\n\n\nVIENNA COFFEE\n\nThe pot required to make coffee after this method is the style with a\ncloth bag in the top.\n\nUse two level tablespoonfuls of coffee to the cup, and place in the\nbag, pouring the boiling water through.\n\nServe with hot milk.\n\n\nENGLISH COFFEE\n\nAfter the recipe of M. Soyer, a former _chef_ of the Savoy.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nPlace two ounces of moderately fine ground coffee in a stew-pan, and\nwithout adding water, hold over the fire, stirring with a spoon until\nthe coffee is very hot. Pour over the coffee a pint of boiling water\nand cover closely; remove at once from fire and let stand for five\nminutes, then strain through a cloth, heat and serve with or without\ncream.\n\n\nCOFFEE, BRAZILIAN STYLE\n\nIn Brazil, whence practically all of the world’s supply of coffee\ncomes, the popular method is to place the coffee in a _woolen_ bag,\nwhich is placed in a pot and boiling water poured over it. The coffee\nis immediately poured off.\n\n\nCOFFEE, BATAVIA STYLE\n\n(_As made by the Dutch coffee planters in Java_)\n\nThe coffee is ground fine and packed tightly in the top of a French\npot. The required amount of _cold_ water is poured over it and allowed\nto drip through. It requires about five hours for the process if the\ncoffee is packed as tightly as it should be. The coffee is then heated\nand from three to four times its volume of hot milk added.\n\n\nTURKISH COFFEE\n\nA heaping dessertspoonful of powdered coffee is added to one small\ncupful of cold water. This is brought to a boil, and the coffee and\ngrounds are poured into the cup.\n\nTurkish coffee is drunk grounds and all, without cream or sugar.\n\n\nKAFFEE “KULTUR”\n\nIt is the unanimous observation of civilized travelers that good coffee\nis unobtainable in Germany. The foremost scientist of that race, the\nfamous Baron von Liebig, nearly a hundred years ago wrote an exhaustive\ntreatise on the subject of coffee and coffee making, and devised the\nconcoction which among Germans now passes for coffee. Was it not given\nthem by authority? This is von Liebig’s recipe:\n\nPut three-quarters of the amount of coffee to be used on the fire\nin boiling water; boil from ten to fifteen minutes. Then put in the\nremaining one-quarter of the coffee, cover and let it stand for five\nminutes. Stir, strain and serve with an equal amount of milk.\n\n\nEXCELLENT COFFEE\n\nUse a drip pot, one having a cloth bag. Wet the bag, place the coffee\nin this, and pack as tightly as possible around the sides and bottom.\nPour in slowly three cupfuls of boiling water to each half cupful\nof powdered coffee. Place the pot on the back of the range, or on an\nasbestos mat with only enough flame under to keep it warm, and pour the\nwater slowly.\n\nServe with cream as soon as dripped.\n\n\nTEA\n\nChin Hung, Chinese scholar and philosopher, to whom all the\nagricultural and medical knowledge of China is traced, once said, so I\nam told: “Tea is better than wine, for it leadeth not to intoxication,\nneither does it cause a man to say foolish things. It is better than\nwater, for it doth not carry disease, neither doth it act as poison.”\n\nThere are really but two kinds of teas on the market: green and black.\nThe color of the tea depends on the oxidation; black tea being exposed\nto the air, or oxidized before final drying, while green tea is dried\nimmediately after rolling.\n\nThere are a number of different brands with which we are all familiar,\nsuch as Formosa, Oolong, Ceylon, English Breakfast, Orange Pekoe, and\nFlowery Pekoe.\n\nRight here I will say that if a spray of orange blossom is kept in the\ntea caddy one need not pay the price for Orange Pekoe.\n\n\nTEA MAKING\n\nBe sure that the water is boiling, and use it at once. Rinse the pot\nwith hot water. Place the tea in the pot in a “ball,” and pour over the\nfreshly boiled water, allowing it to stand for five minutes, then the\ntea-ball and the tea should be removed.\n\nUse a level teaspoonful of tea to one and a half cupfuls of water. I\nthink most people will want to dilute this, even.\n\n\nRUSSIAN TEA\n\n“Russian tea” has a rather inflated reputation, and is not really known\nin this country as it is used there.\n\nA great amount of tea infusion is used, as the samovar is always in\nevidence, but the water is poured on the tea again and again, making a\ngreat amount of liquid without much strength. Sugar and lemon juice is\nadded and it is drunk from a glass.\n\n\nICED TEA\n\nOne may make fresh tea and pour it over cracked ice in individual\nglasses, or one may make a rather strong solution of tea, and add\ncracked ice to it in a large pitcher, or make a weaker solution, and\npour over cracked ice in glasses. The method must depend upon the fancy\nof one’s family, or the hostess.\n\n\nICED TEA WITH MINT\n\nWhile iced tea is usually served with sugar and lemon, I am quite sure\nthat in addition a spray of mint will be found most acceptable. Place\nthe mint in the glass and pour the tea over.\n\n\nHOT TEA WITH MINT\n\nI find that a cupful of hot tea into which a few leaves of mint have\nbeen placed is most refreshing. This may be served either with or\nwithout sugar.\n\n\nCOCOA AND CHOCOLATE\n\nIt is very rare for one to serve chocolate these days, as cocoa in a\nperfected form is put up by reliable firms in this country, and most\nhostesses prefer it to chocolate, which is more difficult to prepare\nand rather richer than wise to serve to the family generally.\n\n\nCOCOA\n\n  1 cupful of milk,\n  1 teaspoonful of cocoa.\n\nBring the milk to the boiling point and pour in the cocoa moistened\nwith a little warm water. Stir and allow to boil, beating with a\ncream whip for a minute or two. Pour through a strainer into a cup or\nindividual pot. Multiply this amount by the number of cups to be served.\n\n\nCOCOA No. 2\n\n  1 cupful of milk,\n  2 teaspoonfuls of cocoa.\n\nUse a _porcelain_ kettle; mix the cocoa with enough hot water to make a\nsmooth paste, pour the milk over it slowly, mixing constantly, so that\nthere will be no lumps left undissolved. Bring to the boiling point,\nand boil for ten minutes. Strain, and serve at once. A teaspoonful\nof sweetened whipped cream added to each cup adds perceptibly to the\nacceptability. Sweeten to taste.\n\n\nCHOCOLATE\n\n  2 cupfuls of milk,\n  2 tablespoonfuls of grated chocolate.\n\nGrate enough unsweetened chocolate to make two tablespoonfuls, mix\nwith a little boiling water, and melt slowly over a low fire, then add\nthe milk, pouring carefully, stirring while pouring. Allow this to\nboil for ten minutes and strain. Whipped cream added to each serving\nis delightful, although it makes the drink a bit too rich for most\npeople. It would be unadvisable for persons given to stoutness to drink\nchocolate.\n\n\nCHOCOLATE\n\n(Recipe of 1845)\n\n  1 inch of a cake of chocolate,\n  1 quart of boiling water,\n    Milk.\n\nShave the chocolate fine, pour on the boiling water; boil for twenty\nminutes, add milk to please and boil up again. Serve.\n\n\nCHOCOLATE (CRÉOLE RECIPE)\n\n  1 cake of French chocolate,\n  1 quart of milk.\n\nGrate the chocolate; mix with a little hot water, and stir into the\nmilk which should have reached the simmering stage. Stir until the\nmixture boils; allow it to boil up once, and serve immediately. This\nmay be sweetened after serving or allow two tablespoonfuls of sugar to\nthe full amount. Add whipped cream if desired.\n\n\nCOCOA (CRÉOLE RECIPE)\n\n  4 tablespoonfuls of cocoa,\n  1 quart of milk.\n\nPut the milk in a double boiler; moisten the cocoa with a little milk,\nand pour into the milk as it begins to boil, stirring constantly. Let\nit boil up once, only, and serve. Whipped cream may be used with it if\ndesired.\n\n\nCOCOA (OLD NEW ENGLAND RECIPE)\n\n  2  tablespoonfuls of cocoa,\n  1  quart of water,\n  1½ cupfuls of milk.\n\nMix the cocoa with a little water and pour into the full amount of\nwater and allow to boil for a half hour, skim, add the milk and allow\nit to boil up again. Serve.\n\n\n\n\n               IX—DRINKS FOR INVALIDS AND SMALL CHILDREN\n\n\nI shall try to give a few helpful suggestions in this chapter for the\nmaking of drinks which are both appetizing and nutritious. Some are\noffered because of their nutritive value and some, like treacle, posset\nand Iceland moss, because they are a real aid in helping to ward off\ncolds and some because they please the palate of the invalid or the\nchild whose appetite must be catered to.\n\n\nAPPLE WATER\n\n  2 large tart apples,\n  1 tablespoonful of lemon juice,\n  1 pint of boiling water,\n    Lemon peel,\n    Sugar.\n\nPeel, core and slice the apples; place them in a deep bowl with the\nlemon juice, one strip of rind and as much sugar as the nurse or mother\nthinks wise, and cover with the boiling water, allowing this to stand\ncovered tightly until cold. Strain, chill and serve in small glasses.\nBe sure to serve on a plate on which a fresh doylie is placed.\n\n\nAPPLE TEA (FROM ROAST APPLES)\n\n(Very old recipe)\n\n  3 apples,\n    Pint of water.\n\nRoast sour apples until tender, pour boiling water over them and let\nthem stand until cold. Sweeten a little if the patient so desires.\n\n\nAPPLE TEA (UP-STATE RECIPE)\n\n  3 large tart apples,\n  1 pint of water,\n    Sugar.\n\nPeel and slice the apples very thin, pour a pint of boiling water over\nthem and boil for five minutes. Allow them to stand until cold, then\nstrain off the water. Sweeten it slightly, unless the patient prefers\nthe water very tart.\n\n\nARROWROOT WITH MILK\n\n  ½ pint of milk,\n  1 dessertspoonful of arrowroot,\n  1 teaspoonful of sugar.\n\nMix the arrowroot with a little cold milk until a smooth paste. Pour\na half pint of boiled milk over it, pouring slowly and stirring\nconstantly. Bring to the boiling point and boil for six minutes.\n(Arrowroot _must_ be well boiled). Strain, add the sugar and serve.\n\nI want to impress upon my readers the necessity of serving any drink\nintended for an invalid in the most attractive manner possible.\n\n\nARROWROOT WITH WATER\n\n  ½ pint of water,\n  1 dessertspoonful of arrowroot,\n  1 teaspoonful of sugar,\n  1 teaspoonful of lemon juice.\n\nMix the arrowroot with a little cold water, making it perfectly smooth.\nPour the boiling water over this slowly, stirring well; cook until\nboiling, and continue for six minutes. Strain, add sugar and lemon\njuice. Serve in an attractive glass on a pretty plate on which a\nspotless doylie is laid.\n\n\nBARLEY WATER\n\nMany cannot take milk plain, but the addition of barley water adds to\nits digestibility.\n\n  2 ounces of pearl barley,\n  1 pint of water,\n    Sugar.\n\nPour the water over the barley and boil slowly until there is a third\nless liquid. Strain and add sugar and serve. Barley water may be served\nalone or with milk. It is more palatable with milk.\n\n\nBARLEY WATER MADE FROM BARLEY FLOUR\n\n  1 teaspoonful of barley flour,\n  ½ pint of water,\n  1 pinch of salt.\n\nMix the barley flour with a little cold water, making a smooth paste;\npour the rest of the water on slowly, mixing and stirring constantly.\nBoil for a half hour, boiling fast all the time. Strain and add to\nmilk, or add a little sugar, or if it is for an infant, it may be given\nfrom a nursing bottle without the sugar, between feedings, especially\nif the child is not getting sufficient nourishment from its own food.\n\n\nBLACK CURRANT TEA\n\nIt is said that this tea is excellent to alleviate hoarseness, and is a\nmost appetizing beverage.\n\n  1 dessertspoonful of black currant jam,\n  ½ pint of water,\n  1 teaspoonful of sugar.\n\nPut jam, sugar and water in an enamel dish and bring to the boiling\npoint; simmer for five or six minutes. Strain and add lemon juice and\nserve hot; or chill and add a little cracked ice and serve very cold.\n\n\nBRAN TEA\n\n  2 tablespoonfuls of bran,\n  1 pint of water,\n  ½ ounce of gum arabic,\n  1 tablespoonful of honey.\n\nMix water and bran and boil for fifteen minutes. Add gum arabic and\nhoney, stir until dissolved. Strain through a cloth and serve. This,\ntoo, may be served hot or cold.\n\n\nEGG WHITE AND MILK (ENGLISH RECIPE)\n\n  1 egg white,\n  1 cupful of milk,\n    Vanilla.\n\nBoil the milk and let it cool. Whip the egg white until dry and put it\nin a tall glass with the milk, flavor with vanilla and serve.\n\n\nOLD FASHIONED CAUDLE (ENGLISH)\n\n  1 tablespoonful of fine oatmeal (ground, not rolled),\n  1 cupful of water,\n  1 cupful of milk,\n  1 tablespoonful of lemon juice,\n  1 strip of lemon rind,\n  1 tablespoonful of sugar,\n    Nutmeg.\n\nBoil oatmeal, water, milk and lemon rind together for ten minutes;\nremove the rind, add the lemon juice, sugar and a sprinkling of grated\nnutmeg. Serve hot. The beaten yolk of an egg may be stirred in if extra\nnourishment is needed.\n\n\nCAUDLE (OLD NEW ENGLAND RECIPE)\n\n  1 pint of rice gruel (see gruel),\n  1 egg yolk,\n  1 tablespoonful of sugar,\n  ¼ cupful of cold water,\n  2 tablespoonfuls of orange juice,\n  1 teaspoonful of lemon juice,\n    Nutmeg.\n\nWhen the gruel is boiling, add the following mixture; beat the yolk\nof the egg with the sugar and stir in the water, fruit juices and a\nsprinkling of grated nutmeg. Strain and serve very hot.\n\n\nCREAM AND CARBONATED WATER\n\n  ½ cupful of cream,\n    Carbonated water.\n\nThere are times when a patient is not allowed milk, but cream is\npermissible; under those conditions, this will be found useful as well\nas nutritious.\n\nPour the cream in a tumbler or straight-sided, tall glass; fill the\nglass with carbonated water, using a syphon.\n\n\nMILK AND CARBONATED WATER\n\n  ½ cupful of carbonated water,\n  ¾ cupful of milk.\n\nIt is a matter of taste just what carbonated water one uses: whether\nseltzer, vichy or club soda; whether poured from a bottle or a syphon.\nPut the milk in a tall glass and fill with the carbonated water.\n\n\nEGG WHITE, LEMON AND CARBONATED WATER\n\n  1 egg white,\n  1 tablespoonful of lemon juice,\n    Carbonated water.\n\nBeat the white of the egg until stiff, put it in a tall glass and add\nthe lemon juice; fill the glass with the carbonated water.\n\n\nEGG YOLK, LEMON JUICE AND CARBONATED WATER\n\n  1 egg yolk,\n  1 tablespoonful of lemon juice,\n    Carbonated water.\n\nBeat the yolk until lemon colored, pour into a tumbler and stir in the\nlemon juice. Fill the glass with the carbonated water.\n\n\nEGG WHITE AND ORANGE JUICE\n\n  1 egg white,\n  1 cupful of orange juice.\n\nExtract the juice from enough oranges (two Florida oranges will usually\nprove sufficient); strain into a tall glass; whip the egg white until\nstiff, and stir it into the orange juice.\n\nIf the patient does not like the taste of the egg white, it were well\nto beat the white until stiff, put it in a cocktail shaker with the\norange juice, shake well for a minute or two and strain into a glass.\nIt will be so blended that it will be very difficult to taste anything\nexcepting the orange juice.\n\n\nEGG WHITE, ORANGE JUICE AND CARBONATED WATER\n\n  1 egg white,\n  1 orange,\n    Carbonated water.\n\nBeat the white until stiff; extract the juice from the orange, stir\nthe egg in carefully and pour into a tall glass. Fill the glass with\ncarbonated water.\n\n\nEGG WHITE, ORANGE JUICE AND DISTILLED WATER\n\n  1 egg white,\n  1 tablespoonful of orange juice,\n  2 tablespoonfuls of distilled water.\n\nIf a baby is very ill and cannot retain food, this will tide it over\nuntil a physician can be called and prescribe.\n\nBeat the egg white until stiff, stir in the orange juice and then the\nwater. Feed with a spoon.\n\n\nFLAXSEED TEA\n\n  2 tablespoonfuls of whole flaxseed,\n  1 pint of water,\n  1 lemon,\n  2 tablespoonfuls of granulated sugar.\n\nMix the flaxseed with a little water, adding the remainder of the pint\nand boil for fifteen minutes. Slice a lemon in a deep bowl and add two\ntablespoonfuls of granulated sugar. Strain the flaxseed tea boiling\nhot, over this, stir and allow to stand until cold. Strain again and\nuse in tablespoonful doses. This is used for cold or to relieve an\nirritated throat.\n\n\nGRUEL (ENGLISH RECIPE)\n\n  ½ pint of milk or water,\n  1 dessertspoonful of fine oatmeal (ground, not rolled),\n    Salt or sugar.\n\nMix the oatmeal with a little cold water in an enameled saucepan; add\nthe milk or water boiling hot, and boil for ten minutes, stirring\nconstantly. Strain, pressing as much of the oatmeal through the sieve\nas possible. Add either salt or sugar as the patient desires. As gruel\ninduces perspiration it is best to take it after one is in bed. This is\nmost satisfactory as an aid in breaking up a cold.\n\n\nINDIAN MEAL GRUEL (YELLOW CORN MEAL)\n\n  2 teaspoonfuls of ground Indian corn meal,\n  ½ pint of water,\n    Sugar,\n    Nutmeg,\n    Cream.\n\nMix the corn meal with enough cold water to make a smooth paste; add a\npint of water, bring to the boiling point and boil slowly for one half\nhour,—never less; strain, add a little salt, or a little sugar if the\npatient does not like the salt. If sugar is used add a sprinkling of\ngrated nutmeg, if salt is preferred, add two tablespoonfuls of cream;\nstir and serve at once.\n\n\nOATMEAL GRUEL\n\n  4 tablespoonfuls of oatmeal (ground, not rolled),\n  3 pints of water,\n  ½ cupful of raisins,\n    Salt,\n    Sugar.\n\nWet the oatmeal with a little cold water, pour over it three pints of\nboiling water, and boil gently for two hours. Strain, add a sprinkle\nof salt and enough sugar to satisfy the patient. A very little mace or\nnutmeg may be added, and, if one wishes, a half cupful of raisins may\nbe put in as soon as the boiling point is reached. If raisins are used\nit is not at all necessary to use sugar, for there is plenty of sugar\nin them to make the gruel most palatable.\n\n\nRICE GRUEL\n\n  2 teaspoonfuls of ground rice,\n  ½ pint of water,\n    Salt,\n    Cream (if allowed).\n\nBlend the rice with a little cold water, add the half pint of boiling\nwater and boil for five minutes.

Throw off this water and cover with a pint\nof fresh water; simmer for one hour, strain, add a tablespoonful of\nlemon juice and a little sugar, being sure that it is not too sweet.\n\nIrish moss is a sea weed and is rather rich in mucilage, iodine and\nsulphur, and is given as an aid in treatment for colds, especially when\nthere is a cough.\n\n\nHOME MADE KOUMISS\n\n(Recipe from an English Physician)\n\nBoil fresh milk, and when nearly cold put into quart bottles, leaving\nroom to shake. Add ½ ounce of crushed lump sugar, a very small piece\nof compressed yeast—about one twenty-fourth of the ordinary yeast\ncake—cork, tie down the cork unless a patent stopper is used; lay the\nbottles on the side, and shake twice daily. If the weather is hot this\nmay be used on the fifth day, if cool, on the sixth, if very cold, on\nthe seventh.\n\n\nLINSEED TEA\n\n  1 ounce of whole linseed,\n  1 pint of water,\n  ½ ounce of liquorice,\n  ½ ounce of rock candy,\n  ½ lemon.\n\nWash, the linseed and simmer with the lemon rind and water for, a half\nhour. Take from the fire, add liquorice and rock candy and stir until\ndissolved. Strain and add the lemon juice. Useful in treatment of colds.\n\n\nPRUNE TEA\n\n  2 ounces of prunes,\n  1 pint of boiling water,\n  1 teaspoonful of lemon juice.\n\nBe sure to select California prunes, for then no sugar will be needed.\n\nWash the prunes and put in a saucepan with the water; simmer for an\nhour, cut the prunes while in the water, then strain through a fine\nsieve, pressing some of the pulp through. Add the lemon juice and\nserve to the patient in a wine glass. This is excellent in cases of\nconstipation.\n\n\nRICE WATER\n\n  1 ounce of best Sea Island rice,\n  1 quart of water,\n    Salt.\n\nThere is no better rice grown than that which we get from the islands\nwhich lie in the Atlantic off the state of South Carolina. This is\nlarge full rice and is by far the most desirable for use for invalids\nand children.\n\nWash the rice in cold water, rubbing it well between the hands. Allow\nwater to run over it until the water runs clear. Throw the washed rice\nin a quart of cold water, and cook rapidly until it boils hard. Then\ncook slower over a lower fire until rather mushy. Two hours is not too\nlong for the boiling. Strain through a fine sieve. Add a little salt,\nor if the patient greatly prefers, and sugar will not harm, sweeten\nslightly.\n\nThis is used in cases of dysentery with salt only, as a drink.\n\n\nRICE MILK\n\n  1 ounce of rice (Sea Island),\n  1 pint of milk,\n    Salt or sugar.\n\nWash the rice as directed in the foregoing recipe, and put into a\nsaucepan with the milk. Boil for one hour. Add salt to taste or a very\nlittle sugar. The salt is preferable. Do not strain this.\n\n\nTOAST WATER\n\n  1 full sized crust of bread,\n  1 pint of water.\n\nSelect the crust of the bread, cut at least an inch thick; toast or dry\nit until brown in the oven, being sure that it does not burn or scorch,\nbut is thoroughly brown. Put this in a deep bowl and pour one pint of\ncold water over it, allowing it to stand for one hour. Strain and use.\nOne may season with a little salt or a sprinkling of celery salt. It\nmay be served either hot or cold.\n\n\nTREACLE (MOLASSES) POSSET\n\n(English recipe)\n\n  ½ pint of milk,\n  2 tablespoonfuls of molasses,\n  ½ lemon.\n\nPut the milk into a saucepan, and bring to the boiling point; add the\nmolasses and lemon juice. This will curdle. Strain through a fine\ncloth. Use hot or cold.\n\n\nTHICK MILK\n\n  ½ ounce of baked flour,\n  ½ pint of milk,\n    Sugar.\n\nPut a half ounce of flour in a dish and put into the oven, allowing it\nto brown slightly. Blend it with the milk, stirring a few drops of milk\ninto the flour at a time, until all the milk is used. Boil for five\nminutes, stirring constantly. Sweeten a trifle and use.\n\nThis is given to patients at times when they are on a liquid diet and a\nchange is needed. A little nutmeg will again change the taste.\n\n\nLEMON WHEY\n\n  ½ pint of milk,\n  ½ lemon,\n    Sugar.\n\nBoil the milk and add the juice from a half lemon. It will, of course,\ncurdle. Strain through a fine cloth; sweeten slightly and use.\n\n\nMILK WHEY\n\n(English recipe)\n\n  1 pint of sweet milk,\n  ½ pint of buttermilk.\n\nBring the milk to the boiling point, add the buttermilk and boil for a\nminute. Strain and use.\n\n\nMEAT BROTHS AND TEAS\n\n\nBEEF TEA OR BROTH\n\n  ½ pound of beef,\n  ¼ teaspoonful of salt,\n  ½ pint of water.\n\nSelect a piece of beef which has little or no fat, preferably from\nthe top round; remove any fats, and cut into strips, then cut across,\nshredding the meat. Put the shredded meat, salt and _cold_ water in an\nenamel saucepan and allow it to soak for fifteen minutes, then place\nover a slow fire. Cook until the meat is white and the juice or broth a\ndeep red-brown. Strain through a fine strainer, pressing the beef hard.\nRemove any particles of grease by drawing a piece of brown paper over\nthe top. Serve hot. Be sure to serve in an attractive cup on a doylie.\nPlease the eye and the appetite is more likely to be tempted.\n\n\nBEEF TEA (MADE IN A JAR)\n\n  1 pound of top round,\n  1 pint of cold water,\n  ½ teaspoonful of salt.\n\nRemove the fat, shred the meat finely and put into a glass jar. A two\nquart glass can such as is used for preserving is desirable. Fasten the\ncover, whether a screw-top or patent fastener, and place in a deep pan\nof boiling water. Keep the water simmering for at least three hours.\nStir the beef occasionally. Strain and remove any fat by drawing a\npaper over the top. Serve.\n\n\nBEEF TEA (RAW BEEF)\n\n  2 ounces of top round,\n  2 tablespoonfuls of cold water,\n    Pinch of salt.\n\nCut all the fat and skin from the beef, and cut into shreds; place in\na glass dish with the water and salt, cover and place in a cold place\nand allow to stand for two hours. Strain and press out all the juice\npossible. Serve a teaspoonful or two at a time. This will not keep, so\nonly a very small amount should be made at a time.\n\n\nBEEF EXTRACT (RAW)\n\n  ½ pound of top round,\n    Salt.\n\nThis extract is given when nourishment must be pushed and can only be\ngiven in small quantities. It is invaluable in cases of rickets and\nscurvy in children.\n\nThere are small meat presses on the market, which are made for the\npurpose of extracting the blood and may be purchased at any large\ndepartment store where there is a housekeeping department.\n\nPut the meat in a pan and sear it quickly; then cut into small pieces\nand place in the meat press; by turning the screw-top extract the blood\nor juice, and pour into a glass. After all the blood is extracted, salt\nslightly and feed with a spoon.\n\n\nBEEF TEA WITH EGG\n\n  ¼ pint of beef tea,\n  1 egg yolk,\n    Salt.\n\nBeat the egg yolk until a light yellow and stir into a half cupful of\nhot beef tea. Add a trifle of salt if necessary.\n\n\nBEEF TEA FOR CONVALESCENTS\n\n  1 pound of top round,\n  1 pint of water,\n  1 piece of carrot,\n  1 piece of turnip,\n  1 spray of parsley,\n  1 tiny pinch of thyme,\n    Small slice of onion,\n    Salt.\n\nRemove all fat from the meat, cut the vegetables into tiny pieces,\nshred the meat and put all in a glass jar with the herbs and salt.\nFasten the top and place in a deep pan nearly full of hot water and\ncook slowly for three hours. Strain and remove any fat which may have\nbeen left.\n\n\nMUTTON TEA\n\n  ½ pound of lean mutton,\n  ½ pint of water,\n  ¼ teaspoonful of salt.\n\nSelect the juicy part of the neck, remove as much fat as possible,\ncut into tiny pieces, put into a saucepan with cold water and salt.\nSimmer gently until the meat turns white and the tea or broth a rich\nred-brown. Strain, remove all fat by passing a paper over the top. If\nit is not possible to remove the fat in this way, cool the broth and\nremove the fat, then reheat. To reheat place the dish holding the broth\nin a pan of hot water. Do not allow broths or teas to boil.\n\n\nCHICKEN BROTH\n\n  ½ chicken (small fowl is as desirable as a chicken),\n  1 quart of water,\n  1 tablespoonful of rice,\n  ½ teaspoonful of chopped parsley,\n  ½ teaspoonful of salt.\n\nCut the chicken into small pieces, and break the bones. Put the meat\nand bones into a saucepan with the cold water, salt and rice. (The rice\nmay be omitted if preferred.) Simmer for three hours, strain, sprinkle\nwith parsley and serve.\n\nThis broth may be made leaving the rice out until cooked, then strain,\nreturn to the saucepan, reheat to the boiling point, add the rice\nand cook for twenty-five minutes. It depends entirely on whether the\npatient may have the rice whole or cooked soft enough to pass through a\nfine sieve.\n\n\nMUTTON BROTH (WITH BARLEY)\n\n  1 pound of mutton (neck or breast),\n  1 quart of water,\n  1 tablespoonful of barley (pearl),\n    Salt,\n    Chopped parsley.\n\nRemove all fats possible and cut the mutton into small pieces. Put\ninto the saucepan with the _cold_ water and salt, bring to the boiling\npoint, skim, add the barley and simmer for three hours. Strain and\nsprinkle with the chopped parsley. If this broth is intended for a\nconvalescent, it need not be strained; remove the meat and bones only,\nleaving the well cooked barley.\n\n\nOYSTER BROTH\n\n  6 selected oysters,\n  ½ cupful of milk or broth,\n  1 tablespoonful of cream.\n\nPut the oysters, their liquor, and the milk or broth (preferably the\nmilk) in a saucepan, and bring to the boiling point. Simmer for _one\nminute_, and strain. The oysters may be chopped finely and returned to\nthe broth or not, as liked. It would seem wise in most instances to\nremove the beards and gristle first and chop only the soft parts.\n\n\nCLAM BROTH\n\nScrub the clams in cold water and place over a hot fire in a large\nkettle and heat until the shells open. Place two thicknesses of cheese\ncloth over a deep dish and strain. Season the broth and serve.\n\n\nCLAM JUICE (COMMERCIAL)\n\nThere is a clam juice on the market,—a “clam concentrate”—which makes a\nsatisfactory broth if it is not possible to obtain fresh clams.\n\n  1 teaspoonful of concentrated clam juice,\n  ⅓ cupful of boiling water,\n    Seasoning to suit.\n\nPut the concentrated juice in a cup and pour the boiling water over it,\nstirring until well mixed. Season to taste.\n\nOne may use milk if one wishes instead of water, or may use half water\nand half milk.\n\n\nCOMMERCIAL BEEF TEA OR BROTH\n\nThere are several manufacturers who put out concentrated beef extracts,\nsome in cubes, and some in a sort of paste form. If one uses the cubes,\none cube is used to each three-quarters of a cupful of boiling water.\nSeason with salt, or with salt and celery salt.\n\nIf one wishes, a drop or two of onion juice may be added to this beef\ntea, as well as salt and celery salt.\n\n\n\n\n                         X—MISCELLANEOUS DRINKS\n\n\nI shall give under this heading several drinks which do not seem to fit\nin any other place.\n\n\nGENERAL HARRISON’S EGG NOGG\n\n  1 egg,\n  ½ teaspoonful of sugar,\n  ¼ cupful of crushed ice,\n  ⅔ cupful of sweet cider.\n\nPlace all the ingredients in a cocktail shaker and shake well for two\nminutes.

One candy\nmanufacturer in New York puts out an excellent article at a very\nreasonable price.\n\nWhile one almost invariably sees pecan nuts used for topping sundaes,\nit is not at all essential that they should be; walnuts, either\ndomestic or English, may be used with equal success. If obtainable, try\nbutternuts broken in pieces.\n\nOne may use either the short-stemmed, wide-topped sherbet glasses or\nthe wide long stemmed champagne glasses for service. These are equally\nattractive.\n\nSelect small plates, place a doylie on each and place the glass on\nthat. Lay a small spoon on the plate.\n\nIn most instances, a rounded spoonful of ice cream is placed in the\nglass first, then the syrup or sauce is poured over that, and nuts, or\nchopped fruits, or both are then added.\n\nOne may use any flavor ice cream one desires, and because of this I\nhave given a number of recipes for ice creams, not only for making\nsundaes because they, too, quench the thirst.\n\nThere is one important thing to remember when making sundaes; they must\n_never_ look mussy! Even though a number of different things are used\nin the making, it is not at all necessary to use such haste that they\nwill not look appetizing.\n\nAfter the cream is in the glass, pour the syrup or sauce over\ncarefully, being sure not to drip it; add the next thing just as\ncarefully as the first, and if nuts are to top the dish, add only\nenough to stay where they are meant to stay—_on the top_. If the nuts\nfall to the service plate the whole service is spoiled in appearance.\n\nAn attractive service makes for the success of the hostess.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nUse vanilla ice cream as the foundation;\n\nPlain syrup, diced bananas, nuts.\n\nPlain syrup, marshmallow cream, chopped bananas, nuts.\n\nCaramel sauce, diced bananas, nuts.\n\nCaramel sauce, sliced bananas, marshmallow cream, nuts.\n\nCaramel sauce, sliced bananas, whipped cream, nuts.\n\nCaramel sauce, diced bananas, whipped cream, chopped cherries.\n\nFor a Banana Split use,\n\n1 peeled banana cut in half lengthwise; lay side by side on plate, put\none spoonful of vanilla ice cream on one end, strawberry ice cream on\nthe other; cover with any fresh fruit in season, crushed and mixed\nwith plain syrup.

to give suggestions for sundaes without\nrecipes for making the sauces to be served on them, I am giving several.\n\nWhile these sauces are given here to use on sundaes, there is no good\nreason why they may not be used for puddings and desserts.\n\n\nHEAVY FUDGE SAUCE\n\n  2  cupfuls of sugar,\n  2  squares of chocolate,\n  1  cupful of milk,\n  1¼ tablespoonfuls of butter,\n  ½  teaspoonful of vanilla.\n\nMelt the chocolate, putting it into a double boiler; add the milk and\ncook directly over the fire until it is well blended; add the sugar and\ncook slowly until smooth. Keep hot in the double boiler or in a chafing\ndish until ready to serve.\n\nThis should be the consistency to pour readily.\n\n\nMARSHMALLOW SAUCE\n\n  ¾ cupful of sugar,\n  ¼ cupful of milk,\n  ½ pound of marshmallows,\n  2 tablespoonfuls of water.\n\nBoil the sugar and milk in a double boiler for about six or seven\nminutes, until it spins a thread. Allow this to become luke warm, then\nbeat until thick and white. Put the double boiler back on the fire and\nstir until thin enough to pour.

To can\nthem at home, the first thing to remember is; the fruit should be well\nripened and the cherries will be far better if it is possible to obtain\nthem directly from the trees. If one is fortunate enough to be able to\nget them from the trees, see that they hang at least four days after\nthey are considered ripe, for they will be larger, riper and sweeter.\n\nAnother thing to bear in mind, is that cherries should be simmered and\nnever boiled.\n\nIt is quite possible to use any canned cherries one may have, or may\npurchase, in making sundaes, or those put up commercially for this\npurpose alone.\n\n\nCANNED CHERRIES\n\nThe amount of fruit depends upon the desire of the hostess, for she may\nhave a few she wishes to can, or a great many; the process is the same.\n\n    Cherries,\n  2 cupfuls of water,\n  1 cupful of sugar.\n\nWash and pit the cherries, put them in sterilized jars, adjust the\nrubbers (new ones), and pour over the boiling syrup, made of the sugar\nand water boiled. Pour in enough syrup to nearly overflow. Partially\nseal the jar and place in a sterilizer, either commercial or home-made,\nand nearly cover with boiling water. It has been found satisfactory by\nthe writer to allow the water to reach just _below_ the top. Sterilize\nfor sixteen minutes.\n\n\nCANNED CHERRIES WITHOUT SYRUP\n\nIf one cares to can the cherries without using syrup, pour plain\nboiling water over the cherries in the jars, in place of the syrup and\nsterilize for a half hour. After sterilization, complete the seal,\ninvert to test for leakage, allow to cool, wrap in dark paper and store.\n\n\nPRESERVED CHERRIES\n\nRemove the pits from the largest cherries obtainable; allow a pound of\nsugar and one cupful of water to each pound of fruit. Melt the sugar\nin the water, let it come to a boil and skim thoroughly. Then add the\ncherries and allow them to simmer for twenty minutes. Take out with a\nskimmer, pack into sterilized hot jars and boil down the syrup until\nquite thick. Fill the jars to overflowing and seal air-tight, using new\nrubbers and hot covers.\n\n\nPRESERVES AND SHRUB FROM THE SAME CHERRIES\n\nStone the cherries and cover with vinegar. Stand in a cool place for\ntwenty-four hours and drain off the fruit juice and the vinegar. To\neach pint of juice add a scant pound of sugar, simmer for twenty-five\nminutes and bottle air-tight. Put the drained cherries in a stone crock\nwith alternate layers of granulated sugar, allowing three-quarters of a\npound of sugar for each pint of fruit. Keep the crock covered and in a\ncool place. Every eighteen hours stir the fruit and sugar carefully for\na period of eight days. The uncooked preserves can be put in small jars\nand paraffined, but they need not be sealed air-tight.\n\n\nMOCK MARASCHINO CHERRIES\n\nSelect the largest sized cherries one can find and remove the pits,\nsaving all the juice. Measure fruit and juice and allow an equal\namount of sugar. Drain the cherries and set on the ice. Put the juice\nand sugar into a preserving kettle, cook to a thick syrup and add the\ncherries. Simmer for fifteen minutes. Drain off half the cherry syrup,\nadd an equal amount of white grape juice, bring quickly to the boil and\nseal as for preserved fruit.\n\n\nDRIED CHERRIES\n\nThe larger the cherry the more satisfactory if dried to use for sundaes.\n\nWash, stem and pit the cherries; spread in thin layers on a drying\ntray. (Commercial driers are inexpensive and very satisfactory.) Dry\nfrom two to four hours, starting at 110 degrees F. Condition them by\nplacing in composition or paper boxes and pouring them from box to box\nevery day for four days. This is to insure even drying. If too moist,\nreturn to the drier for a short time, and again pour into the boxes,\nand again “condition” them.\n\n\n\n\n       XIII—ICE CREAMS, SORBETS, SHERBETS, WATER ICES AND GRANITS\n\n\nGiving recipes for ice creams and the like in a book given to telling\nof beverages would seem a queer conceit, were it not for the fact\nthat ice creams, sherbets and water ices are often used to quench the\nthirst; this is my reason and my only excuse, should an excuse be\nneeded.\n\n\nVANILLA ICE CREAM\n\n  1 quart of cream,\n  ¾ cupful of honey,\n  1 cupful of milk,\n  1 tablespoonful of vanilla extract.\n\nHeat the milk, add the honey, and stir until melted and thoroughly\nmixed.

Boil, strain, cool and freeze.\n\nWith this as a foundation one may add any flavoring desired, or any\ncrushed fruit. Coffee or chocolate may also be used. Very strong coffee\nis needed, but the amount of milk should be reduced in proportion.\n\n\nPISTACHIO ICE CREAM\n\n  2 cupfuls of scalded milk,\n  1 tablespoonful of flour,\n  1 cupful of sugar,\n  1 egg,\n  ⅛ teaspoonful of salt,\n  1 quart thin cream,\n  1 tablespoonful of vanilla extract,\n  1 teaspoonful of almond extract.\n\nMix flour, sugar and milk, add egg, slightly beaten, and milk\ngradually.

Beat into this the scalded milk, place in a double boiler and\ncook until it will coat the spoon. Remove from the fire and when cold\nadd the cream, vanilla and stiffly beaten whites of the eggs. Pour into\na freezer, add the marshmallows and fruit and freeze until firm, then\npack and allow to stand for several hours.\n\n\nCOCOANUT ICE CREAM\n\n  4  cupfuls of milk,\n  2½ tablespoonfuls of cornstarch,\n  2  eggs,\n  ¾  cupfuls of honey,\n  1  teaspoonful of vanilla extract,\n  1  cupful of chopped fresh cocoanut or shredded cocoanut,\n     Preserved cherries,\n     Milk or water.\n\nHeat the milk in a double boiler. Blend the cornstarch with a little\nmilk or water and add to the hot milk and stir until it begins to\nthicken. Add the beaten eggs and honey, cook for a minute or two; add\nvanilla and cocoanut. Freeze, serve in attractive tall stemmed goblets;\ntop with cocoanut and cherries.\n\n\nROSE ICE CREAM (with condensed milk)\n\n  2  cans of condensed milk,\n  3½ cupfuls of water,\n  2  teaspoonfuls of rose extract,\n  3  tablespoonfuls of cornstarch,\n  ¼  cupful of milk, or water,\n  1  teaspoonful of vanilla,\n  1  teaspoonful of orange extract,\n     Red vegetable coloring.\n\nMix one can of condensed milk with two cupfuls of water; add the rose\nextract and enough red vegetable coloring to make the color desired.\nStrain and freeze.\n\nBoil the remaining water (1½ cupfuls) and stir in the other can of\ncondensed milk. Moisten the cornstarch with a little milk or water,\nblend with the milk and water, stirring constantly for five or six\nminutes. Allow to cool, add flavoring, strain and freeze. Place these\ncreams in separate layers in a wet mold, place the cover on securely,\npack and freeze. This should stand at least two hours.\n\n\nPINEAPPLE ICE CREAM\n\n  1½ cupfuls of hot milk,\n  2  eggs,\n  ½  cupful of honey,\n  2  cupfuls of shredded pineapple,\n  1  cupful of cream.\n\nBeat the eggs, mix with the milk and honey; cook until smooth, stirring\nconstantly. Allow to cool, add cream and freeze. When serving this\ncream, a generous spoonful of sweetened whipped cream is a delightful\naddition.\n\n\nSTRAWBERRY ICE CREAM\n\nThis is not difficult to make and approaches the flavor of the fresh\nfruit more nearly than most creams in which fresh strawberries are used.\n\n  ½ pint of thick cream,\n  1 pint of milk,\n  2 tablespoonfuls of cornstarch,\n  2 eggs,\n  3 tablespoonfuls of sugar,\n  ½ teaspoonful of vanilla,\n  1 cupful of strawberry jam,\n    Small pinch of salt.\n\nMake a boiled custard of the milk, cornstarch, salt and the beaten\neggs. Add the vanilla, cool and fold in a half pint of cream which has\nbeen whipped until stiff. Put in freezer and freeze slowly for five or\nsix minutes; open the freezer and stir in a full cupful of strawberry\njam. Re-cover and continue to freeze until firm.\n\n\nGREEN TEA ICE CREAM\n\n  1 pint of milk,\n  1 tablespoonful of green tea,\n  1 pint of cream,\n  ¾ cupful of sugar,\n  3 eggs,\n  ½ teaspoonful of vanilla.\n\nPour one pint of boiling milk over one tablespoonful of green tea, and\nallow to stand on the back of the range or on an asbestos mat over\na low gas flame for five minutes; strain through a double thickness\nof fine cheesecloth. To this add the cream, beaten eggs, sugar and\nvanilla, and stir until it thickens. Add a little green vegetable\ncolor. Place in a cold dish and allow to cool. Freeze, repack, and\nallow to stand until ready for use.\n\n\nEASY PEACH ICE CREAM\n\n  1 pint of peach pulp and the juice,\n  1 cupful of sugar,\n  1 quart of cream.\n\nCrush the peaches, using enough to make a pint of pulp. Save all the\njuice. Add the sugar to the juice and pulp; then add the cream, whipped\nas stiff as possible. Blend and freeze.\n\n\n                      SOME UNUSUAL FROZEN DAINTIES\n\n\nCOFFEE PARFAIT\n\n  1  pint of thick cream,\n  1½ cupfuls of confectioner’s sugar,\n  ½  cupful of strong coffee,\n  ½  teaspoonful of vanilla,\n  ½  teaspoonful of gelatine,\n     Milk.\n\nDissolve the gelatine in two tablespoonfuls of milk, and pour the hot\ncoffee over, stirring well; add sugar and vanilla. Fold in the cream,\nwhipped stiff, pour into the freezer, pack in ice and salt and allow to\nstand for at least four hours.\n\nServe in attractive tall glasses, topped with a generous spoonful of\nsweetened whipped cream.\n\n\nAPRICOT PARFAIT\n\n  1½ cupfuls of crushed apricots (canned or fresh),\n  2  tablespoonfuls of lemon juice,\n  ¾  cupful of sugar,\n  1  teaspoonful of gelatine,\n  2  eggs,\n  1  cupful of thick cream.\n\nMash the fruit and press through a fine sieve, add the lemon juice and\nsugar and heat until it reaches the boiling point, stirring constantly;\nbeat the yolks of the eggs until very light and add slowly to the fruit\nmixture while hot; return to the fire and cook until a custard-like\nconsistency. Dissolve the gelatine in a very little water and add\nto the fruit and eggs; allow to cool; chill; beat the whites of the\neggs until stiff, and the cream until firm, and add both to the fruit\nmixture.\n\nPour into a mold, pack in ice and salt and allow to stand for several\nhours; serve in tall narrow glasses.\n\n\nCHERRY PARFAIT\n\n  1  cupful of thick cream,\n  ⅔  cupful of sugar,\n  ⅓  cupful of water,\n  2  egg whites,\n  1  tablespoonful of gelatine,\n  ¾  cupful of marshmallows,\n  1¼ cupfuls of stoned cherries (canned red cherries may be used),\n  1  cupful of cherry juice,\n  2  tablespoonfuls of lemon juice.\n\nCut the marshmallows into very small pieces, and cut the cherries in\nhalves; combine these with the cherry juice and allow to stand for two\nhours.\n\nBoil the sugar and water until it will “spin a thread” and pour slowly\nover the stiffly beaten whites of the eggs, beating constantly. Allow\nit to become chilled, and stir in the stiffly whipped cream. Soak the\ngelatine in a little water and melt over hot water. Strain into the\nfruit mixture, beating briskly, until well blended; allow this to cool\nand when it begins to thicken, beat in the whipped cream. Pour into a\nwet mold, pack in ice, and salt, and allow to stand for three hours or\nmore. Serve in parfait glasses, topped with whipped cream and a cherry.\n\n\nGRAPE AND PINEAPPLE PARFAIT\n\n  2 cupfuls of milk,\n  2 egg whites,\n  1 cupful of sugar,\n  ½ cupful of chopped nut meats,\n  ¼ teaspoonful of powdered nutmeg,\n  4 cupfuls of pineapple juice,\n    Preserved grapes,\n    Whipped cream,\n    Rose extract,\n    Crystallized mint.\n\nThe foundation of this delightful parfait is made in the following\nmanner: Scald the two cupfuls of milk and add the beaten egg whites;\nstir in the sugar and chopped nuts. Cook until thick, add the nutmeg;\ncool and add the pineapple juice and freeze.\n\nPut a spoonful of frozen mixture in the bottom of a tall glass, then a\nspoonful of preserved grapes, and fill the glass with the cream. Top\nwith whipped cream which has been sweetened and flavored with rose. A\ncrystallized mint adds to the attractiveness of this unusual parfait.\n\n\nRASPBERRY PARFAIT\n\n  1 pint of cream,\n  1 pint of raspberries,\n    Sugar.\n\nWhip a pint of cream until very stiff, and sweeten with powdered\nsugar slightly. Cook the raspberries until broken, which should not\ntake more than five or six minutes; press out all the juice and pulp\npossible, and reboil with three-fourths as much sugar as juice. Allow\nthis to cool. Spread whipped cream in a mold, and pour some of the\nraspberry syrup over, and add more cream, and so fill the mold. Unless\none prefers, then the syrup and whipped cream may be lightly mixed\nbefore packing in the mold. Pack in ice and salt and allow to stand for\nseveral hours.\n\n\nMAPLE BISQUE\n\n  2 eggs,\n  ½ pint of cream,\n  ½ cupful of maple syrup,\n    Vanilla.\n\nBeat the yolks of the eggs until very light, add the maple syrup\nslowly, and heat over a slow fire, stirring constantly until it reaches\nthe boiling point. Boil for one minute only; remove from the fire,\nstrain and cool.\n\nBeat the cream until firm and add to the stiffly beaten whites of the\neggs. Pour the syrup mixture over this slowly, beating constantly; add\nthe vanilla. Pour into a mold, pack and freeze.\n\n\nPEACH MELBA\n\n  1 pint of heavy cream,\n  1 pint of milk,\n  1 cupful of sugar,\n  1 tablespoonful of gelatine,\n  ½ teaspoonful of vanilla,\n  1 can of large peaches or ½ dozen selected peaches.\n\nHeat the milk and sugar, until the sugar is thoroughly dissolved;\ndissolve gelatine in a little cold milk and add to the heated milk and\nsugar.\n\nAllow this to cool, add the cream whipped stiffly, flavor and pour into\nthe freezer. Freeze until the crank turns very hard; remove the dasher,\nrepack and allow to stand for two hours.\n\nWhen ready to serve, place a half peach on the bottom of a long stemmed\nglass, fill with the cream, put the other half of the peach on top and\ntop with raspberry syrup, then the whipped cream.\n\n\nSAUCE.—To one cupful of raspberry jam add one cupful of boiling water\nsweetened a bit; boil for five minutes, strain, chill and use.\n\n\nPEACH DELIGHT\n\n  2 cupfuls of water,\n  ¾ cupful of honey,\n  1 teaspoonful of gelatine,\n  1 cupful of peach pulp,\n  1 lemon,\n  1 orange,\n  1 cupful of cream, whipped.\n\nBring the water and honey to the boiling point and continue to cook\nfor twenty minutes. Add the gelatine which should have been soaked and\ndissolved in a little cold water; strain and allow to cool.\n\nWhen cold add the peach pulp, orange pulp, orange juice and the juice\nof half a lemon. Turn into a freezer and freeze slowly. Serve in\nattractive glasses, topped with whipped cream.\n\n\nFROZEN PEACHES\n\n  4  cupfuls of mashed peaches,\n  1½ cupfuls of sugar,\n  1  teaspoonful of lemon juice.\n\nWipe the peaches with a damp cloth; pare and put the skins and one\npeach pit in two cupfuls of cold water and allow to boil for twenty\nminutes; strain through a sieve, pressing out all the juice; add the\nsugar, boil until the sugar is thoroughly dissolved and set aside to\ncool.\n\nWhen cold add the mashed peaches and the lemon juice and freeze.\n\nIf one wishes, a spoonful of whipped cream added to each serving adds\nperceptibly to this dainty.\n\n\nCRUSHED PEACHES\n\n  Peaches,\n  Sugar,\n  Cream.\n\nThe housekeeper often finds that peaches are too ripe to slice and\nuse with cream; in which case it is wise and economical to skin them,\nremove the stones and mash through a coarse sieve, adding sugar, honey\nor syrup to taste. If the peaches are the kind which have little\nflavor, a little lemon juice is desirable. Serve in low stemmed sherbet\nglasses, topped with whipped cream, on which a candied cherry may be\nplaced.\n\n\nFROSTED BANANA CREAM\n\n  Bananas,\n  Sugar,\n  Lemon juice.\n\nSelect only very ripe bananas; mash to a paste, sweeten with powdered\nsugar and flavor with a few drops of lemon juice. Press through a sieve\nand to each cupful of banana add a half cupful of whipped cream. Mix\nand serve in attractive glasses, and sprinkle with powdered sugar.\n\n\n                    SORBETS, SHERBETS, ICES, GRANITS\n\nThe difference in sorbets, sherbets, ices and granits is slight, still\neach fills its own particular purpose and place. Sorbets are supposed\nto be served after the meat course, and while the same ingredients are\nused they are not frozen as long or as smooth as sherbets. Sherbets\nare smoother and firmer, and may well take the place of ice cream as a\ndessert. Water ices are made the same as sherbets, leaving out the egg\nwhites. Granits are water ices frozen slightly; in fact so they will\npour, and may be used as a drink.\n\n\nBLACKBERRY SORBET\n\n  2 cupfuls of sugar syrup,\n  3 tablespoonfuls of lemon juice,\n  1 cupful of rich milk,\n  2 quarts of blackberries,\n  1 tablespoonful of gelatine,\n  2 egg whites.\n\nPress the berries through a sieve fine enough to keep the seeds from\npassing through, but pass the pulp through. Add the syrup and lemon\njuice. Dissolve the gelatine in a little water, and add to the berry\njuice and milk. Pour this mixture into the freezer and turn until\nit begins to thicken. Add the stiffly beaten whites of the eggs and\ncontinue to freeze until fluffy, but not so smooth as for sherbet. This\nis a fine distinction, but still it is considered worth differentiation.\n\nWhen this “fluffy” stage is reached remove the dasher, repack and allow\nto stand for about two hours.\n\n\nPLUM SHERBET\n\nWhile any of these recipes may be made into either sherbet or sorbet, I\nwill give from now on only the sherbet recipes.\n\n  1 quart of ripe plums (preferably red)\n  2 cupfuls of sugar syrup,\n  2 egg whites.\n\nSelect only very ripe plums; wash, remove pits, and press through a\nsieve. There should be a pint of this pulp and juice. Add syrup, freeze\nuntil well thickened, add the stiffly beaten whites of the eggs, and\ncontinue to turn until frozen smooth and as hard as this sort of thing\ncan well be frozen.\n\n\nCRANBERRY SHERBET\n\n  1  quart of cranberries,\n  1  quart of water,\n  1  tablespoonful of gelatine,\n  1½ cupfuls of syrup,\n  1  egg white.\n\nCook the cranberries in water for ten minutes. Press through a fine\nsieve, return to the saucepan and add the syrup, cook for five minutes,\nturn into the freezer, and when partly frozen, stir in the stiffly\nbeaten white of an egg (use two egg whites if eggs are plentiful), and\nfinish freezing.\n\n\nGRAPEFRUIT SHERBET\n\n  2  cupfuls of water,\n  2  cupfuls of grapefruit juice,\n  1½ cupfuls of sugar,\n  1  teaspoonful of gelatine,\n  ½  cupful of white grape juice,\n  1 egg white,\n  2 tablespoonfuls of chopped cherries.\n\nBoil the water and sugar together for ten minutes; soften the gelatine\nwith a little water and stir into this syrup. Cool, add the juice of\ngrapefruit and the grape juice. Turn into a cold freezer and when the\nmixture begins to thicken well, add the stiffly beaten white of an\negg and the cherries (two egg whites are better if eggs are not too\nexpensive). Cover and freeze until firm and smooth.\n\n\nGRAPE SHERBET\n\n  1 teaspoonful of gelatine,\n  ¾ cupfuls of grape juice,\n  1 cupful of syrup or sugar,\n  ½ cupful of honey,\n  2 tablespoonfuls of lemon juice,\n  ½ cupful of water,\n  1 egg white.\n\nSoak the gelatine in a little cold water; boil the syrup, honey and\nhalf cupful of water, and add the dissolved gelatine. Allow this to\ncool, add grape juice and the lemon juice and freeze. Open the freezer\nwhen slightly hard and add the stiffly beaten egg white. Re-cover and\nfreeze until smooth and hard. (Two egg whites are better if plentiful.)\n\n\nCRÉOLE LEMON SHERBET\n\n  3 lemons,\n  1 cupful of sugar,\n  2 cupfuls of water,\n  1 egg white.\n\nBoil the water and sugar, and add the grated rind of one lemon. Cool,\nadd the juice of three lemons, strain through a fine cloth, and freeze\nuntil partly frozen, remove the cover, add the egg white stiffly\nbeaten. Cover again and freeze until smooth.\n\n\nMILK SHERBET\n\n  2 lemons,\n  1 cupful of syrup,\n  3 cupfuls of whole milk,\n    Candied cherries.\n\nMix the juice of the lemons and the syrup, add the milk very slowly,\nstirring constantly, as it will curdle if poured too fast. That will\nnot spoil the sherbet, but it does not look so well and one’s appetite\nis helped by the appearance of one’s food.\n\nFreeze the mixture, serve in attractive glasses, with a few chopped\ncandied cherries.\n\n\nORANGE SHERBET\n\n  1 egg white,\n  2 cupfuls of orange juice,\n  2 tablespoonfuls of lemon juice,\n  1 cupful of water,\n  ¾ cupfuls of sugar (brown sugar or syrup may be used).\n\nPut the sugar in a saucepan with the water, bring to the boiling point,\nthen cool. Add the orange and lemon juice, a pinch of salt and freeze.\n\nBefore the freezing is complete, add the egg white beaten stiffly;\nrepack and continue to freeze until smooth.\n\n\nSTRAWBERRY SHERBET\n\n  1 quart of strawberries,\n  2 cupfuls of water,\n  1 tablespoonful of lemon juice,\n  ¾ cupfuls of syrup or sugar,\n  1 egg white.\n\nWash and hull the strawberries, mash well and press through a\ncheesecloth. Add the syrup, lemon juice and water. Mix well, freeze\npartially, add the stiffly beaten egg white, and finish freezing.\n\n\nRASPBERRY SHERBET\n\n  1 quart of raspberries,\n  1 egg white,\n  3 cupfuls of water,\n  1 cupful of syrup or sugar,\n  2 tablespoonfuls of lemon juice,\n  2 cupfuls of raspberry juice.\n\nMash the berries and press through a cheesecloth; pour boiling water\nover the syrup; add the berry juice and lemon juice and freeze. When\npartially frozen, add the stiffly beaten egg white, stir in well, and\ncontinue to freeze until smooth.\n\n\nEMERGENCY PEACH SHERBET\n\nThis might also be called an economical sherbet, for one may use just\nas many peaches as one has. For in this recipe one is supposed to use\npeaches too ripe for slicing.\n\nMash the peaches, and press through a coarse sieve and sweeten to\ntaste. Half fill sherbet glasses with finely shaved ice and pour the\nsweetened peach pulp over. Top each serving with a preserved or candied\ncherry.\n\n\nPINEAPPLE SHERBET\n\n  1½ pints of grated pineapple,\n  1½ cupfuls of syrup,\n  1  tablespoonful of gelatine,\n  1  pint of rich milk,\n  2  egg whites.\n\nTo the grated pineapple (canned may be used if fresh pineapple is not\nin season) add the syrup and the gelatine which has been dissolved\nin a small amount of water. Stir, pour into the chilled freezer, and\nfreeze until about half frozen; open the freezer and add the milk;\nagain turning the freezer until it turns with difficulty. Uncover,\nadd the stiffly beaten whites of the eggs, turn until well mixed, and\nthoroughly hard.\n\nIf the dasher is removed and the sherbet repacked and allowed to stand\nto “ripen” for two hours, there will be a decided improvement in flavor\nand texture.\n\n\nTEA SHERBET\n\n  2 cupfuls of tea,\n  1 cupful of sugar,\n  1 lemon,\n  1 orange,\n  ½ cupful of water.\n\nMelt the sugar in the water and allow to begin to boil; take from the\nfire and add the juice of the lemon and orange; stir well, add the tea\nand freeze.\n\n\nAPPLE ICE\n\n  1  quart of tart red apples,\n  1½ cupfuls of maple sugar,\n  3  cupfuls of water,\n  1  tablespoonful of lemon juice.\n\nWash, quarter and remove the core, but do not pare the apples. Put them\ninto a saucepan with the water; boil rapidly until soft. Mash and add\nthe maple sugar. When cold press through a fine sieve, add the lemon\njuice and freeze.\n\n\nLEMON ICE\n\n  1 cupful of sugar,\n  3 lemons,\n    Water.\n\nAdd a cupful of sugar to the zest of one lemon and the juice of three;\nadd enough water to make a quart. Allow this to come to the boiling\npoint, cool, strain and freeze.\n\n\nLOGANBERRY ICE\n\n  2 cupfuls of loganberry juice,\n  1 cupful of sugar,\n  1 tablespoonful of lemon juice.\n\nBoil the water; add the sugar and when cold add the lemon and\nloganberry juices. Freeze until smooth and hard. Repack and allow to\nstand for two hours.\n\n\nSTRAWBERRY ICE\n\n  1 cupful of sugar,\n  1 cupful of water,\n  1 quart of strawberries.\n\nBoil the sugar and water until it bubbles. Wash and hull the\nstrawberries; mash and press through a cheesecloth. When the syrup is\ncold, add the strawberry juice and pulp; mix well and freeze.\n\n\nWATERMELON ICE\n\n     Ripe melon,\n  1½ cupfuls of sugar,\n  2  oranges,\n  1  lemon,\n  ½  cupful of white grape juice,\n     Pink vegetable coloring.\n\nRemove the pulp from a ripe melon; press it through a fine sieve and\nadd the sugar, lemon juice, orange juice and the zest of one orange and\nthe grape juice. Color with enough vegetable color to make it a real\nwatermelon pink; pack and freeze.\n\n\nFRUIT GRANITS\n\nGranits are really “snow waters,” frozen only enough to admit being\npoured. The granits are frozen in a freezer, although the Créoles\nusually freeze them in the “old fashioned water jugs.”\n\n\nORANGE GRANIT\n\n  1½ cupfuls of orange juice,\n  ½  pound of sugar,\n  1  pint of water.\n\nPeel six oranges very carefully, removing all the inner white part of\nthe skin, and slice very thin. Place this in a deep bowl and sprinkle\ngranulated sugar, allowing it to stand for five hours. Squeeze the\njuice from six oranges, and press the juice from the sliced ones,\nstraining it and mixing the plain juice with this syrup. Add the water,\nstrain and pour into a freezer; and freeze until like mush. Serve in\nsmall punch glasses.\n\n\nLEMON GRANIT\n\n  1 pint of water,\n  ½ pound of sugar,\n  1 cupful of lemon juice.\n\nExtract the juice from the lemons, add the sugar and stir until\ndissolved; add the water and freeze until mush-like and serve in\nattractive punch glasses.\n\n\nSTRAWBERRY GRANIT\n\n  1  quart of strawberries,\n  1  tablespoonful of strawberry extract,\n  1  tablespoonful of lemon juice,\n  1  pound of sugar,\n  1½ pints of water.\n\nCrush the berries and cover with the sugar, allowing this to stand for\nfive hours. Strain and press through a sieve, pressing out all the\njuice possible. Add the lemon juice, water and the extract. Turn this\ninto a freezer and freeze until like mush. Serve in punch glasses.\n\n\nRASPBERRY GRANIT\n\n  1 quart of raspberries,\n  1 tablespoonful of raspberry extract,\n  1 pound of sugar,\n  ½ cupful of currants,\n  1 pint of water.\n\nCrush the currants and raspberries and cover with the sugar, allowing\nthis to stand for five hours. Press through a sieve, being sure to\nleave no juice which can possibly be pressed out. Add the extract and\nwater and freeze until like mush. Serve in punch glasses.\n\n\n                                THE END.\n\n\n\n\n                                 INDEX\n\n\n    Apollinaris lemonade, 7\n\n    Applebloom punch, 18\n\n    Appleblow
