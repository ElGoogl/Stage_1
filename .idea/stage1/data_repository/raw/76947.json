  "content": "The Land Beyond the Mist\n\n                           By Ernest Haycox\n               Author of “A Wooing in the Wilds,” etc.\n\n\nTo keep out the misery of the eternal Oregon rain, Tom Cameron sang.\n\nThe heavens leaked with a persistence beyond the experience of the\nemigrant train. In seven days there had been no sun or sky above the\ntops of the fir trees. A heavy rolling mist hung over the line of\nwagons, shutting them out from the rest of the world as effectually as\nif they were in a fog bank at sea. Through this dark, lowering curtain\ncame the steady deluge, soaking into the canvas schooner tops, wetting\nclothes, bedding, penetrating the food--reaching every fabric and\nevery article. There was not an ounce nor an inch of anything dry in\nthe whole weary column.\n\nCameron’s pony walked as if he were a twenty-year-old nag. His flanks\nsteamed and twitched, his hoofs were weighted down with huge lumps of\ngummy clay, his mane hung in separate twisted hanks. The animal was in\nno worse shape than his master, whose blanket capote dripped water\nlike a colander sieve. Rivulets ran from the man’s beaver cap across\nhis wet face to a yellow mustache; fell from either side of this, like\ntwin waterfalls, to the capote and thence streamed down the buckskin\nbreeches in an ever-growing course, falling finally to the sodden,\nmud-sunken road in a tiny cascade.\n\n“I’d be a danged sight more dry if I turned this hyar shirt inside out,”\nmuttered Tom, wringing his mustache free from its accumulation of water.\nThen he fell again to the song.\n\n    “Oh, Kernel Doniphan-o----”\n\nIt was in the late fall of ’48, and these twenty wagons were traversing\nthe Barlow Road over the Cascades to the valley of the Wallamet. The\ntrail ended for them after a long, long journey. They had started from\nIndependence, Missouri in April and it was now November. In the\nbeginning, it had been a hundred wagons trekking across the vast prairie\nlands, following the plainly marked, deeply rutted Oregon Trail. At Fort\nHall many months later the greater part of the caravan turned south for\nCalifornia and gold while the rest followed the older road to the\nColumbia and the old Wish-Ram villages at the Balles. Here they split\nagain, part rafting down the bitter-cold river to Fort Vancouver, the\nrest coming over the new Barlow Road.\n\nThe patient oxen pulled at the traces, slipping and sliding in the muck.\nThe bull whips whistled and cracked. Somewhere ahead of Tom Cameron the\nlead wagon groped in the mist seeking the road through the everlasting,\ndismal firs. The cattle herd was equally lost in the mist behind. It was\nall a confusion of noises, overborn by the clack and clatter of vehicles\nand the incessant pattering of the rain. The wailing of infants came up\nto him from many a direction, mingling with the shouts and epithets of\nthe drivers. A brave pioneer woman in some distant schooner was singing\na hymn:\n\n    “Bless’d be the land of plenty----”\n\nIt was a stirring tune and an inspiring thought, yet the woman’s voice\ncracked in the middle of the verse and went down a-wailing. Ah, it was\nweary and heart-breaking, this last stage of the trip! Where was the\npromised land, the lush meadows free for the preempting, the bountiful\ngame, the smiling sun? Had they come so far to find so poor a welcome?\nBetter by far the fever and ague of Missouri, infinitely better the\ncrowded, dearer land of Iowa.\n\nOff to the right boomed the turbulent Clackamas. Tom Cameron wrung his\nmustache again and pulled a little aside to allow another horseman\npassage room. It was “Old Man” Follett, holding a dripping hand to a\nWebsterian brow. The elder’s face formed an incongruous appearance. A\nbulging upper part harbored a pair of sweet, candid blue eyes,\ncomplemented by an undershot bull-dog jaw covered with stubble.\n\n“By Godfrey, Tom, ain’t there any sun in this cussed land?” A linsey\nwoolsey coat hung like a meal sack from his shoulders. “My fambly’s\nall got chills. I ain’t been dry fer a week. Ef we don’t find Oregon\nCity mighty soon thar’ll be some buryin’ to do.”\n\n“What’s Captain Bell say?”\n\n“Shucks, Tom, he ain’t no wiser nor you and me. Dang, sometimes I wish\nI was back in old Illinois. Ef I don’t find good land here I reckon the\nmissis won’t ever look me in the face again.”\n\nA lank Missourian shouted from his wagon seat. “Land o’ plenty, hey?\nThunder, I’m ready fer the turn around! I’d like to git aholt of the\nalligator who guv me the idea of leavin’ St. Louis! I’d put his haid\nin a tub o’ water an’ see how he liked drownin’. Got a chaw?”\n\nOld Man Follett moved on. “No, I ain’t. Ain’t been up to our wagon for\na couple days, Tom. Another scrap with Susie? Waal, I reckon I wouldn’t\nblame anybody fer quarrelin’ this weather.” He was lost the next minute\nin the fog, leaving the younger man silent. There was no longer any\nsavor in singing the song about Colonel Doniphan. The misery of the\ndank, skin-creeping atmosphere worked on his nerve. A draggled sight he\nmade, but no sorrier than any other of the train. There was no laughter\nthroughout the whole caravan; the flame of anger and personal grievance\nhad burst out continuously in the past week. Elders were bickering over\ndirections; young men going at it rough-and-tumble fashion behind the\ncattle herd where there was no hindrance to gouging or heel and toe.\nThe Emory boys bullied all the rest. Tom Cameron pulled at his mustache\nand was warmed by a persistent anger.\n\nThe horse started and wheeled, plunging against the Missourian’s wagon.\nCameron brought up and turned to see the dripping face of an Indian buck\npoke through the vine maple, stare a moment, and disappear. He spurred\nthe horse in pursuit, but the underbrush was too heavy and, recollecting\na clearing a short distance back which seemed to promise entrance into\nthe soaked woods, he swung around and galloped down the line of\nschooners. The coast tribes, he had heard, were not openly hostile. It\npaid, however, always to keep on the alert. One Indian might mean a\nwhole band of warriors waiting at some convenient ambush.\n\nSo thinking, he edged between bushes and wagons, the horse sliding in\nthe mire. Of a sudden the brush dropped back into the mist and a bare\nforeground loomed up ahead. Turning, horse and rider were immediately\nisolated from the column. The grind and clatter advanced out of the\nhaze, witness to the proximity of people; a driver spoke to his oxen\nin tones that boomed up to Cameron like a gun shot; and yet there was\nnot a single glimpse of movement to be seen through the uncanny pall.\nThe rain beat slantwise against him, redoubled in force. Then the\nhorse stopped and a young man in homespun, hatless, dashed through\nthe mist, closely followed by a mounted trio. The young fellow pulled\nup directly before Cameron with something like a gasp of relief. Upon\nsight of this the horsemen came to a sharp stop.\n\n“Oh, you’re hereabouts, huh?” grunted the foremost. A scowling chap,\nhe was, with a black cowlick roaming below the brim of his Missouri\nhat and dividing a narrow forehead. It was a dark face with a broad\nnose and thick, mobile lips--handsome in a way and possessing, when\nbroadened into a smile, an undoubted attraction for women. It was\notherwise with the men of the train, who saw only the danger signs\nin the ill-disciplined features. They left “Hank” Emory, leader of\nthe three Emory boys, alone. The other two were lesser copies of the\nolder brother, with much the same sullen expression, the same\npouting lips and depth of chest.\n\n“Tom,” said the young fellow, panting. “They’re pickin’ on me ag’in.”\n\n“I’ll teach you to stand in my road!” cried Hank Emory, swinging down\nfrom his saddle. “Make a monkey out o’ me, huh?”\n\nThe first rule of frontier existence bids each man shoulder his own\nburden and go his own way; interference is not tolerated save as it\ncomes by request. Here was a fight brewing between the bully and the\nother, with three men a-saddle impassively looking on. Emory was the\nheavier, the more dangerous, carrying with him the threat of many\nwhispered brutalities. The chap facing him, while not much younger,\nseemed to be overawed by his reputation, but he shook his fist at\nthe aggressor and appealed to Cameron. “I ran because all three were\non me. You see fair play’s done, and I’ll fight. I ain’t afraid.”\n\nCameron nodded. “Clean fightin’, Emory. No rough an’ tumble.”\n\nEmory bore down upon his opponent viciously. There was a wild swinging\nof fists and the swift escape of breath. The lad’s head snapped back\nand his hands went down; he was sprawled upon the wet turf with a hand\nto his stomach, writhing from side to side and sobbing like a child.\n\n“Teach you manners!” yelled Emory, jumping forward. His hat fell off,\nand the mop of black hair waved wildly above the cowlick. The dark\nface was a seamed battleground of unrepressed fury. The two followers\nlooked on with satisfaction. Tom Cameron brought his arm from beneath\nthe capote, bearing a pistol.\n\n“That’s a plenty. Stop right thar.”\n\nEmory stumbled and brought up. “Plenty? Why, I ain’t begun to teach him\nmanners.”\n\n“You’ve had yore chance. That’s plumb plenty. Git along and leave him\nalone.”\n\n“Maybe you’d like to try it out,” said Emory, his eyes growing wider.\n“I’ve had my fill of yore ways. Climb down and risk a fall.”\n\n“When I fight with my fists I’ll choose the place,” replied Cameron.\n“Want to have somebody holding a gun on the rest of yore friends.”\n\n“Haw! Reckon yore back is made out o’ the color yaller!”\n\n“Thar’ll be plenty o’ time to decide that, too.” Cameron pulled on his\nmustache until the skin grew white at the roots. “When I come callin’\nyou’ll git plenty chance to prove it.”\n\nFrom beyond the curtain of fog there emerged an unusual, disconcerting\nsound. It started with a distant shout from the front, half inaudible.\nThe successive wagons picked it up, men and women alike adding their\nvoices until, when the rear of the column was reached, it had become a\nmighty cry. Guns were fired, pans beaten. A woman screamed at the top\nof her voice:\n\n“Glory, glory, glory! Oregon City! Praise God!”\n\nThe whole train resounded with the racket. Dogs were yapping; the cattle\nbawled out of fear. Some one took up a banjo and a popular tune trembled\non a nasal voice while the strings made a flat, unmusical sound against\nthe wet sounding board of the instrument. No matter, the song was sung\nwith vigor, with a dozen voices picking it up.\n\nJourney’s end at last! Somewhere in front was the goal they sought, the\nshining reward that had held their courage night after night. Somewhere\nin the mist was Oregon City, the capital of the provisional government\nof Oregon, whose fame had lured them away from solid, comfortable homes\nand sent them all the way across the desert and over the mountains.\nOregon and plenty!\n\nEmory gave a last scornful glance at Cameron, sprang to saddle and tore\nthrough the fog, with his followers close behind. The fallen lad picked\nhimself up and hobbled toward the train with an apologetic glance at his\nprotector. “Reckon they’ll be layin’ for you now,” he said. “There’s\nbeen plenty of talk of a fight atween you and him. Whole camp speaks of\nit.” He grew angry all in a moment. “Don’t you let him swipe yore girl.”\nThen, ashamed at the outburst, he broke into a trot and vanished.\n\nThe noise lost volume as if the wagons had of a sudden plunged over a\nprecipice. Cameron urged his horse through the gray wall and found the\ncow herd driving in front of him; he pushed around it and alongside the\ntrain until the trees vanished once more. Through the mist he made out\nthe spire of a church. A screeching of brakes and a cry of warning was\nborn back down the line. “Watch fer the grade! Turn yore wagons out o’\nline at the foot o’ the hill--goin’ into camp!”\n\nCameron cut through and galloped along the side, descending a\nprecipitous hill. In this pocket the fog thinned, and before his\nastonished vision stood the city mentioned by a thousand camp fires,\nthe Mecca of the West.\n\nOne narrow street wavered between a double row of frame houses and\ncabins. To the left reared the gray shadow of the basaltic bluff the\ntravelers were descending. On the other hand Cameron heard the sheeting\nsound of the rain pouring on a river. This, he decided, would be the\nWallamet, for the roar of the falls, likewise famed in a hundred\nreports, thundered down the mud-bogged street. The houses were\nweather-beaten; across the false fronts of a few stood painted captions.\nA store, a grain shed, a pit saw and--witness of civilization’s march--a\nnewspaper. In all the length of the rain-drenched thoroughfare there was\nnot a single sign of life. Cameron arrived at a glaring sign across one\nsuch false front announcing “Rickerson’s Gen’l M’ch’d’se.” On impulse he\nslid from the dispirited horse and entered the place, slamming the door\nagainst the wind. There, at last, he saw people; one sallow woman stood\nbehind the counter and fixed her snapping eyes at a tall, loosely\njointed character against the wall.\n\n“Honest?” she asked in a shrill voice. “Did I say you wa’n’t honest?\nBut ef you was Governor Abernethy himself I wouldn’t give a nickel’s\ncredit! How can a body make a living that a way? You are like every\nother shiftless man--wantin’ to run off to Californy and hunt gold\nwhile the crops go to pot here and poor wimmenfolk near starve!”\n\n“Ma’m, I reckon my credit ought to be good. Yore husband never denied me\nwhat I needed. It’s only a sack o’ flour and a shovel I’m askin’.”\n\n“To traipse off to Californy with. Fools’ gold! Stay home, I say, and\ngrow wheat. That’s better’n gold. Ef my husband guv you credit, why,\ngo an’ hunt him up.” She turned toward Cameron with a bitter smile.\n“Nary an able-bodied man left in Oregon any more since this turrible\ngold fever. January it was they discovered it at Sutter’s Mill. A bad\nJanuary for Oregon. Women and children plowin’ the ground and the\npesky Indians bolder’n ever. My husband gone off with the first,\nvowin’ to git rich. Not a word have I heard since. But what would you\nbe wantin’?”\n\n“Some tobacco,” said Cameron. “And a few sticks of that dry kindling\nwood by the stove, if I may.”\n\nOvercome with a mumbled dissatisfaction, the lackadaisical fellow\nsauntered toward the door, shooting a glance at Cameron’s wallet\nwhen the latter paid for his tobacco. “I wouldn’t blame old Joe,” he\ncalled over his shoulder, “ef he never come back. Fer a wife you\ntalk too much.” Then he slid hastily into the rain. Cameron,\ngrinning, followed, tucking the kindling wood beneath his capote. He\nbent his head against a sudden onslaught of the storm and picked a\nway between the houses, now and then casting a wistful glance at the\ncheery lights that glowed from within. He passed the church a second\ntime, and in five minutes was within the circle of wagons.\n\nThe site picked for this day’s rest was indeed a miserable one. Half\nof the ground was overflowing with water; the rest was ankle-deep in\nmud. One great blaze shot up from the center, and lesser fires\nstruggled by several of the wagon tongues. The families for the most\npart stuck within the damp shelter of the wagons. The burst of\nexcitement had subsided; not a song rose above the splashing rain;\nnot a cheerful word could be heard save from one small group of men\nnear the big fire. There, surrounded by the newcomers, stood a\nplump, middle-sized gentleman, dressed in lawyers’ black and with a\ngray-shot beard and beaming eye, sheltered under an umbrella. It was\nAbernethy, the governor.\n\n“Rain? Bless you, rain does no harm in Oregon. But we have plenty of it.\nFrom October to May. As for land, God made the finest land and placed it\nin these valleys. But the best pieces near by are taken. You’ll have to\nscout around, go farther into the bench, or beyond Chemeketa, six and\nseven days’ riding.”\n\nCameron rode on to a certain wagon in the circle where Old Man\nFollett struggled with a dying flame. He turned his mild eyes upward,\nand for the first time in all that two-thousand-mile trip the bitter\ndiscouragement was apparent in them. “Tom, whar’s mercy in this\nworld?”\n\nCameron drew out the handful of dry kindling and passed it to the\nelder. When he raised his head he saw Susan Follett watching through\nthe front opening of the wagon. His mud-splashed countenance resumed\nsome small measure of its gayety. Yet there was no answering smile\non her clear, oval face; no welcome in the gray, spirited eyes; no\nencouragement in the manner she lifted her determined little chin.\nShe was a frontier girl, born of a frontier family and having that\nfusion of elements in her blood which forever left its impress on\nall things coming under its influence. It was as if Tom Cameron had\nstruck flint with steel and aroused a spark. Well, there was powder\nto put that spark in action. He was no lovesick swain. He compressed\nhis lips and turned away.\n\nThe cause of the quarrel? Who might tell? Who knows the list of nine\nthousand and nine things, any one of which may be disagreed upon by\nman and woman. A thousand miles back on the Sweetwater there had been\na quarrel and a reconciliation. But thereafter disagreement kept\nobtruding itself. Then Hank Emory, arrayed in his finest trappings,\nswirled up to pay court, leering at Cameron’s impassive face. There\nwould be trouble brewing there. Such a man was Emory that other men\ndistrusted him, and women found something attractive in the rough\ncoat of gallantry. Susan Follett spent one defiant glance at Cameron\nand chose to give the bully her attention. It was more fuel than\nEmory needed to augment his overbearing attitude.\n\nThe fire guttered in the wind and took fresh life from the dry kindling.\nFollett shielded the blaze with his coat. “I darn near got my bellyful\nof misery. I ain’t no glutton fer such punishment. Whar’s all this good\nland, eh? Tom, somebody’s stretched the truth. I might have known.” He\ndrove two sticks into the ground and fashioned a crane. “Susie, pass out\nthe big kettle.”\n\nThere was a splashing of mud and the profane shouts of men; through\nthe downpour appeared Emory and his brothers. The horses reared and\nsat wildly on their haunches. Follett muttered his disapproval.\nCameron moved not an inch.\n\n“Wet weather, wet weather!” cried the leading Emory. “Didn’t I tell you\nCaliforny was yore proper station? Thar’s gold and sun to be had.”\n\n“Tarnation!” muttered Follett. “Do ye take me for an old fool?”\n\nEmory guffawed and favored Cameron with a sharp, sudden look of malice,\nthen doffed his hat in a gesturing circle to Susan Follett who once more\nappeared at the front oval. “Lady, it’s shore damp for purty faces.”\n\nShe smiled. Cameron, looking up, saw that the smile was a little pinched\nabout the corners of the mouth. Her answer, though welcoming, lacked\nwarmth. Any less obtuse individual than Hank Emory might have noticed\nit. But he grinned broadly and swung nearer the wagon. “Well, yore at\nthe end of the trip, Susie. Ain’t it about time fer an answer?”\n\nFollett started up with a burning stick in his fist. “Susie?” he said\nsoftly to Cameron. “Thar’s liberty for you.”\n\nCameron laid on a restraining hand. “Let it run a little longer,” he\ncounseled, and pulled at the yellow mustache.\n\nThe girl shook her head and seemed to draw away. “Mister Emory, aren’t\nyou a little hurried?”\n\n“Haw! That’s the same song you guv me last time. I ain’t to be put off.\nHyar I be, a two-fisted fellow, good enough for a lot of women. Ain’t I\ngood enough for you? Sartain, I can fight harder’n that fruz-faced\nMethodist stickin’ so close to yore paw.”\n\n“Reckon that’s a point to be settled now,” broke in Cameron, handing the\nreins of his animal to Follett. The scene had attracted attention, and\nthe quick dismounting of Emory brought a dozen of the younger men up on\nthe rush. “It was sort of agin’ my principles to fight in the train,”\ncontinued Cameron. “Thar was trouble a-plenty. We’re camped now and it\ndon’t matter.”\n\nEmory jeered, “Nice boy, nice manners,” and looked around for his\nbrothers. They had been edged away by the spectators, so he shoved his\nburly head between his shoulder blades and began weaving his fists.\n“I’ll tan you! The devil with sech nice ways.”\n\n“Any way goes,” countered the other and stepped swiftly aside. Emory\nrushed in with the black, curly poll pointed like a battering ram.\nCameron was not to be deceived; he saw the little red-rimmed eyes\npeering up at him, waiting for a slip off guard. A fist whirled out,\ngrazed Cameron’s chest and passed on. For so heavy a man the braggart\nworked lithely. He was about in a moment and charging again, this\ntime upright, both arms flailing. Cameron stumbled in the mud, caught\ndesperately at one of those arms and, going down, pulled his opponent\nalong.\n\nIt made a weird, unbelievable scene with the rain falling in a\nnever-ending downpour, and the ground six inches deep in muck. The\ncrowd stood closely about and yelled. Follett clung to his club; the\nfire was trampled out and the ashes smoked dismally. Governor Abernethy\nhad advanced with the rest and stood foremost, the umbrella shielding\nthe lawyer’s black coat, watching the battle with humorous eyes.\n“This,” he said to Follett, “is a peaceful land. Most of our quarrels\nhave to be imported from Iowa and Missouri.” From her vantage point on\nthe wagon Susan Follett stared in alarm, fists clenched and body moving\nunconsciously with the fighters. When Cameron went down beneath the\nbraggart’s weight she struck the wagon seat with her knuckles and cried\n“Tom!”\n\nBut Tom was buried too deeply in the mud to hear. The stuff covered\nboth men from head to foot. Neither could get a grip and hold it. Time\nand again blows were launched which missed and landed in the gumbo. The\nbraggart churned both feet to get a better position, lost his balance,\nand went rolling. The lanky fighter found his opportunity at that\nmoment, got to his knees and fell astride Emory, seizing the black\nhair. That brought a roar of delight from the crowd. Emory’s head sank\ndown until a yell of fear bubbled out of the muck. Cameron swayed in\nhis improvised saddle, raised the braggart’s head for the moment and\nrecited a short apology. “Say it after me; I beg the lady’s pardon fer\ncausin’ so much trouble.’”\n\n“The devil----”\n\nDown went the head until a geyser of water shot up and a strangled\ncry emerged. Cameron yanked the poll up a second time. The apology\nwas offered in wheezing syllables. Cameron released his grip, sprang\nup and watched for further aggressiveness. Emory was in no condition\nto do added damage. His mouth and eyes were plugged and plastered;\nnot until some kind one thrust him through the crowd to his brothers\ncould he find his bearings.\n\nCameron was not in much better shape. The governor’s eyes beamed. “Looks\nlike you were an alligator from some Louisiana swamp. I’ve seen much\nfighting but your style is most entertaining and least sanguine.”\n\nIt furnished a moment’s diversion in a dreary day and put the people in\nhigher humor as they plowed off to their respective wagons. Follett\npointed to the creek. “Reckon you’d best hunt out a quiet spot and take\na swim, Tom.”\n\nFrom the wagon’s seat came a bitter voice. “You bully! Do you think a\nfight settles anything? Shame for such a disgraceful scene! If it were\nme I’d be hiding my face!”\n\nCameron met Susan’s disapproving eyes and slapped a hand to his\ncountenance, wiping off some of the mud. “Ain’t it hid?” he asked.\n“Durned if I don’t think so.”\n\n“Shame on you! If I were a man I’d----”\n\n“Be fightin’ too,” finished Tom grimly. “That’s the best thing you an’ I\ndo.”\n\n“Susie, git back in that wagon,” ordered Old Man Follett. “When it comes\ntime for womenfolk to mix in men’s doin’s I’ll say so.” He watched his\ndaughter’s head disappear and turned with a pessimistic gesture. “Waal,\nnow, whar are we? All the best land gone hereabouts. Another week’s\njourney in this cussed weather an’ no prospect then of hittin’ the right\nplace. I’m an old fool.”\n\nTom picketed his horse and waded through the rain. The creek left the\nwagons and dropped over a rock declivity to the river. At the mouth was\na kind of cove with the rain fog curtaining it from the houses. Cameron\nstripped and washed his buckskin suit. A half hour later he was in the\nstreet again, wringing wet but at least clean. There was a stove in the\nstore he had first entered, and toward this he moved.\n\n“Hey, pardner, wait a minute.”\n\nHe turned upon a figure sloshing through the mud. When the man was\nnearer, Cameron saw it to be the same individual he had met in the\nstore arguing with the woman; tall, loose-jointed, stubble-faced and\nwith a chaw of tobacco bulging in one jaw.\n\n“Have some? Waal, say, I see you’re from the wagon train. Reckon you’ll\nbe lookin’ fer land. Mebbe Abernethy’s done told you it’s harder\npickin’ than it used to be? Shore it is. You’ll be travelin’ plumb past\nChemeketa--mebbe even as fur as the Calapooia range, afore you find\nanything onless yore real lucky. I’m an old-timer hyar, and I know a\nsmart leetle valley that ain’t on the main traveled way. ’Tain’t but\ntwo days’ travel from hyar, to’rd the Cascades. Fine red-shot soil.\nGrow anything. Injuns thar, but a decent show of spunk’ll keep ’em\nhumble.”\n\n“How is it you’re not on this piece?”\n\n“I’m fer Californy as soon as I c’n get a grub stake. That cussed\nwoman won’t trust me fer a nickel’s wuth of anything, and I’m busted.\nWas aimin’ to claim a section o’ that land--it’s two sections big\nabout--but I’ll give you the location for twenty dollars cash, and ef\nthat ain’t cheap as dirt then old Sam Warner’s Injun-crooked.”\n\nThe street echoed with shouting, the mud gurgled and splashed. Once\nmore a stream of profanity, and then the Emory boys rode by. Hank\nEmory leaned in the saddle as he passed and stared at Cameron with\nhis bloodshot little eyes, then at the tall old-timer. In a moment\nthey were out of sight, the report of their progress still coming\nback.\n\n“Mebbe you’d figger me not wuth my word,” put in Warner. “Waal, there’s\nGeorge Abernethy now with his bumbershoot.”\n\nThe staid governor picked his way down the muddy thoroughfare. Warner\nraised an arm. “George, I’m talkin’ turkey to this young feller and I’d\nlike yore say-so about me.”\n\nAbernethy clapped Cameron on the back. “It’s our young fighter, isn’t\nit? Well, whatever Sam Warner tells you is so. There’s just one\nexception I make.”\n\n“What mought that be, George?” asked Warner, shifting his chaw.\n\n“When you are drunk you’re of no use to anybody.” And into a shop\nAbernethy turned, smiling.\n\n“That’s right, that’s right, but I’m sober’n a judge right now. Just\nwish I had four bits fer a drink.”\n\nCameron made a swift decision. “Come into the store and show me the\nlocation. If it sounds good I’ll pay twenty for it.”\n\nOne hour later Cameron, dried and warmed, came out of the place\npossessing a rough chart of the hidden valley southeast of Oregon\nCity. It was, according to Warner, not hard to find, but only off the\nbeaten track of incoming settlers and hitherto undiscovered by them.\nA bowl of meadow and beaver dam land two sections in extent, roughly,\nand just big enough for two preemptions. Cameron’s and Follett’s.\nCameron bent through the interminable drizzle to the camp. Night fell\nsuddenly without the transition of twilight. A ring of fires swayed\nand guttered in the chilly gusts of wind. Old Man Follett still hung\nover his own blaze; Mrs. Follett and Susan were inside.\n\n“Reckon our troubles are mostly over,” announced Cameron and shoved the\nmap at the elder. “Hyars movin’ orders. We’ll start out first thing at\ndaylight. Let the rest travel another week if they want. We’ll be\nsettled in two days.”\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were up before dawn, groping through the rolling mist and shivering\nat the raw touch of clothes and harness. It still rained; the wind came\nin gusts from the river. Follett fumbled around the oxen with no single\nword of greeting. His heart had utterly deserted him. The womenfolk were\nwithin the sodden shelter of the wagon. In this fashion they pulled out\nof the silent ring and rolled down the main street, hubs deep in the\nmire. Cameron, rolling loosely in the saddle, felt his horse rise\nbeneath him in fright. Up through the clammy wall shuffled a nondescript\ncharacter, bowed against the elements.\n\n“Reckoned you’d be startin’ real early.” It was Warner, and his tongue\nformed words clumsily. “I’m a durned fool. Got on a spree last night\nan’ sort of emptied myself of words. When I sobered I remember tellin’\nthree fellers about this little valley. Location an’ everything. Three\nbrash young fellers, as I recolleck, one of ’em purty heavy o’ shoulder\nan’ black-haired.”\n\nCameron sat rigid. Treachery? What had Hank Emory done now? Only a\nfool would have slept so soundly through the night while any chance\nof crooked work were possible. He thwacked a hand against his thigh\nin self-anger. Warner spoke again.\n\n“I’d hand back that twenty dollars, but she’s plumb spent on grub. Funny\nnow, how these fellers picked me up on the street and loaded me with\nrum. It shore looks like a deliberate job. But how’d they know I knew of\nany place? Waal, you travel on. I’m goin’ after my hawsses. Reckon I’ll\nguide you to that place and ef thar’s trouble we’ll have it out somehow.\nI ain’t goin’ to have you fooled out o’ that location.”\n\nHe disappeared, leaving Cameron to forge along with the wagon. The\nEmory boys, then, had paid sharp heed to Warner when they passed him\nthe previous day. The bully’s fertile, restless mind had noted the\nevident seriousness between the old-timer and Cameron; with the cunning\nof some Blackfoot spy he had found the rest by use of alcohol. Cameron\nknew he would stop at nothing, that he would bend heaven and earth to\nforestall the Folletts after suffering the check to his vanity. There\nwas trouble ahead. The weary rider swung his hand to the cartridge\nbelt. The oxen struggled up the narrow trail to the summit of the cliff\nwhile the sheeting thunder of Wallamet Falls enveloped the whole party.\nWarner galloped into view, his long visage set in a bilious line. “Bear\noff to left at the next trail!” he shouted. “Short cut. She’ll be a\nleetle rough goin’ but I jest now heard that them three fellers pulled\nout ahead of us. We got to overtake ’em.”\n\nAll that had gone before was ease and comfort compared to this new\nroute. Warner said it was an Indian trail. It was scarcely that. The\noxen lumbered and plunged through the up-growing scrub bushes--salal,\nironwood, grape and hazel--while the wagon top shook torrents of\nwater from the fir boughs. They came to a hill and slid down\nside-wise with locked wheels, mud flying high. They fought across a\nswollen creek, the wagon and team drifting a hundred yards downstream\nbefore striking bottom. On the far side another dark forest engulfed\nthem. Even the long-enduring Mrs. Follett cried out for fire and rest\nat this unprecedented misery.\n\nBut a kind of madness seemed to sway the men. They had gone beyond\nstrict reason and traveled with that bitter decision which comes in\ncompany with desperate circumstances. The rain had numbed them\nbeyond feeling; no situation had power to discourage them more than\nthey already had been discouraged. Follett swung the bull whip and\ncursed at rare intervals. Cameron’s sandy mustache drooped low; the\nman himself shivered with a queer kind of ague. He had not been dry\nfor seven days on end, nor had slept under any shelter, nor eaten\nanything save jerked venison and chicory coffee.\n\nWarner shoved them relentlessly. It was he who knew the fords, the\ntrails, the easier grades. Noon came in this incessant downpour, but\nthey kept their path. The women passed out lumps of pemmican. Cameron\ntook his from Susan with a hand that shook like an aspen leaf in the\nwind.\n\n“Tom, what on earth ails you? You’re sick.”\n\nWarner said. “Tech o’ chill. Sun’ll dry him out.”\n\n“Sun! My Godfrey!” bawled Follett. “Does the sun ever shine in this\ncountry?”\n\nThey plunged into another creek, entered another forest, climbed and\ndescended another hill. So ended that first bleak day which darkened\nand disappeared, leaving the fog and rain in undisputed mastery while\nthe wind whipped through the tree tops and snapped branches all during\nthe night. There was little sleep to be had. Before the first gray\nlight they were in motion, following the monotonous winding of the\nroad until, that mid-afternoon, the trees vanished; the rain died to\nintermittent showers and, far above, the sun struggled to pierce the\nclouds. Warner got from his horse and went to all fours, searching the\nground. “Hyars whar the main road and the short cut come in. Lord cuss\nme ef them three fellers ain’t ahead o’ us! Fresh hoof prints, ’bout\ntwo or three hours old.”\n\nFollett snapped the bull whip, and the wagon went on, ponderous,\ncreaking. “Up that thar hill!” said Warner and they climbed until they\nwere lost in the mists. Stumps and logs ended. A green, lush orchard\ngrass sprang beneath their feet at the summit like the nap on some\nmassive carpet. “Down thar in the pocket,” pointed the guide, “is the\nland. But hyars hoof prints ag’in. Them rascals air ahead of us shore\nenough. Ef they’ve staked corners I reckon we’re beat. That’s all’s\nnecessary.”\n\nCameron mused. “If they’ve only been hyar an hour or two I doubt they’d\nstake corners. They ain’t possessed with that much patience.”\n\nDoubt swayed the guide. He bit morosely into his tobacco. “But thar\non the land. That’s plenty. Possession’s all ten p’ints o’ the law,\nby gee. I’d be willin’ to drive ’em off, but that’d git to Oregon\nCity in no time and whar’d you be in law? I reckon we’ve lost the\nrace. Waal, you foller me down the valley a week or so and I’ll find\nyou some land.”\n\nCameron shook his head and stared at the billowing mist. Out of that\npall emerged a dull echo of voices. “There they are,” he murmured.\n“But they ain’t the kind to set in one place very long. It ain’t in\ntheir blood.” He turned to Follett. “Reckon I’ll deal a hand in this\ngame. We’re a-goin’ to scrap fer what we want. Drive yore wagon down\nthe hillside ontil you strike the fog line. Jest let ’em see the\nwheels movin’ and hear the team grunt. Then we’ll keep goin’ on\naround the rim until we strike a draw somewhars and drop out o’\nsight.”\n\n“What fer?” inquired Warner with a dubious expression.\n\n“Strategy,” replied Cameron. Follett spoke to the team and set the\nbrakes. Down the wagon slid, with the younger man trotting in advance.\nAs they descended, the fog thinned, and the ground below came into view\nuntil Cameron drew up his horse in plain sight of a gleaming green\nbowl’s bottom with a creek brawling through it, half hidden by alders.\nBy these alders flamed a fire. There were the Emorys.\n\nCameron wheeled his horse back into the fog and motioned for Follett\nto turn. The movement put the whole group out of sight once more, but\nthe screaming brakes echoed from one side of the bowl to the other,\nas did Cameron’s suddenly raised voice. “Beyond the draw!” he called.\n“We’re on the wrong side of the hill! Into that big clearin’!”\n\nBack to them came Hank Emory’s exultant shout. “Go on,” directed Cameron\nin a lower tone. “Let ’em shout. They’ll be doin’ some figgerin’ in a\nwhile.”\n\nAnd so they were. Hank Emory watched the wagon snake back to the\nfog-hidden upper regions until there was left only the intermittent\nsight of a wheel rolling mysteriously, independently along, or the queer\nspectacle of eight dismembered oxen legs trampling forward. Then these\nsigns too were lost. But the noise was plain enough, receding toward a\nnot far distant head of the valley where another low pass apparently\ngave entrance into another stretch of open land. Emory heard Cameron’s\n“Beyond the draw!” and muttered a doubtful curse into his beard. “Whar’s\nthat fool goin’ now? This are the place.”\n\n“Mebbe it ain’t the only good land in these parts,” offered one of the\nbrothers.\n\n“Or mebbe that drunk fool give us wrong directions arter all,” added the\nother.\n\nHank trudged a ring around the circle, growing more savage of temper at\neach pace. “Ef I thought so I’d kill him.” He cocked his head forward,\nbut the wagon was seemingly quite far off, crawling over the pass, and\nhe stared at the blank white wall with a growing ugliness. “Sakes, I\nain’t no cussed farmer! Ain’t doin’ us any good hyar ef they didn’t mean\nto settle it fust. That old fool said this war the only good spot in the\nhull country.”\n\nA quiet suddenly descended; the booming of the wagon wheels no longer\nblended echoes with the clattering brook. One lone shout wafted back\nand that was all. Hank Emory halted dead in his tracks. “I ain’t to be\nfooled!” he burst out. “Durned ef I’ll be given the haw haw. Git yore\nhorse, we’re goin’ after ’em.”\n\n“What fer? Most likely they’ll be squattin’ on a piece afore we c’n stop\n’em.”\n\n“Then we’ll drive ’em off! Didn’t I say I’d get square fer that\ndrubbin’--an’ fer bein’ used by that china-faced girl?” The trio tore\naway from the blaze; hoofs drummed in the sodden earth; the report\ntrembled and vanished.\n\nIt all happened swiftly. At one time they were about the fire; next\ninstant they were gone. The flame leaped and swayed, the creek worried\nand foamed at the gravel banks. Then, without sound or warning Cameron\nand Warner slipped through the befogged alders to the fire. Warner’s\nface relaxed. “I reckon that’s what you mought call playin’ tag.\nThey’re off an’ we’re on. Ef they ain’t staked corners we’re in lawful\npossession. I’ll mosey out and drive somethin’ in the corners ef thar\nain’t nothin’ now, which will natcherly do it up brown fer us.” He\ngalloped away.\n\nOn another corner of the compass echoed the wagon again, not far off\nand coming rapidly to the urge of the bull whip. Cameron sang out,\n“Straight ahead. Come along.” At intervals he repeated it to give\nFollett his bearings. In five minutes the vehicle dropped into view\nlike some pioneer chariot descending from the skies, and lumbered up\nto the fire. Follett jammed on the brakes. “It’s gettin’ lighter,\nseems to me. Sun’s tryin’ to git through. Susie--maw--come out an’\ngit warm! Hyars a fire, and it ain’t rainin’ fer a minute at least.”\n\nOnce more the drumming of hoofs trembled through the mist. The trio\nwere flying back. Tom Cameron slipped his revolver around and got\nfrom his horse. “Not yet. Back in the wagon, Susie. Thar’s apt to be\na stray bullet or so in the next minute.”\n\n“Tom--there’s no need of spilt blood. I’d rather give in and try another\nplace.”\n\n“Our own land? I give up nawthin’ to those sports.”\n\n“Right,” agreed Follett, crawling from the wagon seat. “It’s time to git\nshet o’ that pack o’ trouble. Git me the buffler gun, Susie.”\n\nThere was a snorting of horses, a violent oath, and Hank Emory came\nto view as of old, his animal rearing wildly at the bit’s yank and\nsliding to a halt. The other two brothers trailed behind. The elder\nbully jumped from the saddle and stood before Cameron with his\nred-rimmed eyes growing bloodshot. “My land, Methodist, and I’ll\ntell ye to git off sudden.” He was shaking his head like an angry,\nuncertain bear.\n\n“First come first served,” countered Tom.\n\n“Which is us.”\n\n“I guess not. Wa’n’t no sight of you when we came. Moreover we paid\nfair for the location.” Then he took a bold shot. “If you wanted it\nwhy didn’t you stick--why didn’t you mark the corners?”\n\n“Hey?” shouted Emory. “Tryin’ to make a fool out of me, you ginger-bread\ndandy? I ain’t traipsin’ around lookin’ fer corners to mark. We war here\nfust and that settles it. You’ll go, and you’ll take yore friends to\nboot. Fool me? I guess not! Clear out!”\n\nCameron inclined his ear to some not-far-off sound. “When you stepped\nover that draw you abandoned this piece o’ land, leavin’ it unmarked.\nWhoever reached it next had fair claim to it. That’s us. Moreover we’ve\ngot stakes out now on a couple corners for good measure. That settles\nit as far as preemption goes. We’re in possession lawfully and aim to\nstay.” As he finished, Warner arrived and slid from his horse. “Found\none nice little pile o’ rocks nigh to the summit and jest considered it\nas one of our corners. No sign of anything else. She’s yours lawfully.”\n\nBut Cameron had no attention for him. His eyes were upon Hank Emory,\nwhose red lids squinted under the sudden rising fury. The black head\ndropped in unison with the gun arm. The brothers spread out fanwise.\n\n“Ho!” yelled Follett and brought up the buffalo weapon. He was far\ntoo slow. Emory’s pistol was in the air, breast-high, when Cameron\nshot. There was no answering bullet; the leader of this boisterous\ngroup, bereft of his animal vitality, of his huge voice and scowl,\nfell like a sack of meal, with never a single word to announce his\npassing--a faint look of surprise on his face. The brothers stood\nirresolute, guns half out, covered by Warner and Follett. From the\nwagon Susan looked compassionately down at the dead man. “Tom,\nTom--I’ll be forever sorry!”\n\n“No need to be. It’s been a long time brewin’, and somebody had to end\nit. ’Twas now or later; me or somebody else; this quarrel or another\nquarrel. The man was made for a sudden death.” He motioned to the\nremaining pair. “Pick him up and take him away. Reckon you’ll find it\ninconvenient to come back.”\n\nThey did as told, hoisting the body into the saddle and, supporting it\nbetween them, rode away into the mists.\n\nAs if by prearrangement the mists were suddenly shot with a gleaming\nlight; a crack in the eternal fog widened and through it came a swift,\nmomentary shaft of the winter’s sun. It flashed down on the heavy\ngrass with all the verdant brilliance of an April day, twinkled in the\nbrawling creek, sparkled in the drenched tree tops. That short bit of\nheat set the whole rolling valley to steaming and from the earth came\na yeasty, humid, pungent smell. Follett turned his mild eyes up along\nthe expanse of meadow with such an expression of confidence as had not\nbeen there since spring in Missouri. “Waal, hyar’s land good enough.\nAnd thar’s the sun.”\n\n“Worth fightin’ for I guess,” stated Cameron a little dourly, and turned\nto Susan. “I been waitin’ for you to change yore mind back to where it\nused to be. If it’s the same story as it was yesterday I guess I’ll jest\nleave you folks and mosey along to Californy with the rest.”\n\n“Why, Tom, are you blind?” Whereupon he grinned like a schoolboy and\nturned to the fire with a gesture of ambition. “Jest about, I guess.\nWell, dad, let’s get started on the cabin. It’d best be a double\naffair. Two families take up a lot o’ room.”\n\n\n[Transcriber’s Note: This story appeared in the November 7, 1925\nissue of _Western Story Magazine_.]\n\n\n\n\n\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE LAND BEYOND THE MIST ***\n\n\n    \n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

Email contact links and up\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\n\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks."
