Roots, leaves, and\r\nflowers of several of the species most detrimental in the United States\r\nare gathered, prepared, and cured in Europe, and not only form useful\r\ncommodities there but supply to a considerable extent the demands of\r\nforeign lands. Hence it appears probable that while weeds can hardly\r\nbe made desirable, still in his fight to exterminate them the farmer\r\nmay be able to turn some of them to account. Some of the plants\r\ncoming within this class are in many States at present subject to\r\nantiweed laws and farmers are required to take measures toward their\r\nextermination. It seems, therefore, desirable to make these pests\r\nsources of profit where possible. In many cases, when weeds have been\r\ndug, the work of handling and curing them is not excessive and can\r\nreadily be done by women and children.\r\n\r\nThe prices paid for crude drugs from these sources are not great and\r\nwould rarely tempt anyone to pursue this line of work as a business.\r\nYet, if in ridding the farm of weeds and thus raising the value of the\r\nland the farmer can at the same time make these pests the source of a\r\nsmall income instead of a dead loss, something is gained.\r\n\r\nIn order to help the farmer to obtain the best possible prices for such\r\nproducts, instructions for collecting and preparing crude drugs derived\r\nfrom weeds are here briefly given. The collector should observe them\r\ncarefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    COLLECTION AND CURING OF DRUGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nToo much emphasis can not be placed upon the importance of carefully\r\nand thoroughly drying all crude drugs, whether roots, herbs, leaves,\r\nbarks, flowers, or seeds. If insufficiently dried, they will heat\r\nand become moldy in shipping, and the collector will find his goods\r\nrejected by the drug dealer and have all his trouble for nothing.\r\n\r\nAnother important matter to be considered in collecting drugs for\r\nmarket is freedom from foreign substances. All drugs should be clean\r\nand wholesome looking and contain no admixture of fragments of other\r\nplants, stones, dirt, or other impurities. A bright natural color is\r\nextremely desirable in leaves, herbs, and flowers, and adds much to\r\nthe salability of the product. This can be readily brought about by\r\ngiving careful attention to proper drying in the shade (not in direct\r\nsunlight), and by protection from dew or rain by placing the drugs\r\nunder cover at nightfall or whenever necessary. Roots may be cleaned by\r\nwashing, but leaves, herbs, and flowers should never be washed.\r\n\r\nIt is important also to collect drugs in proper season only. Neglect in\r\nthis respect will bring nothing but disappointment to the gatherer, as\r\ndrugs collected out of season not only are not acceptable to the dealer\r\non account of inferior medicinal qualities, but there will also be, in\r\nthe case of roots, a greater amount of shrinkage in a root dug during\r\nthe growing season than will take place when it is collected after\r\ngrowth has ceased.\r\n\r\nThe collector should be sure that the plant he is collecting is the\r\nright one. There are many plants that closely resemble one another,\r\nyet one may possess medicinal properties and the other be absolutely\r\nuseless. Again, a plant may contain very poisonous principles, and if\r\nrepresented to be something else, it might of course do untold injury.\r\nIt would therefore be best, where any doubt exists, to send a specimen\r\nof the entire plant, including leaves, flowers, and fruits, to a drug\r\ndealer or to the nearest State experiment station for identification.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ROOTS.\r\n\r\nRoots should never be collected during the growing season, as at that\r\ntime they are deficient in medicinal properties, and they also shrink\r\nmore in drying and weigh less than when gathered at full maturity.\r\n\r\nThe roots of annual plants should be dug just before the flowering\r\nperiod, and those of biennial or perennial plants after the tops have\r\ndried, the former in the autumn of the first year and the latter in the\r\nfall of the second or third year.\r\n\r\nAfter the roots have been dug the adherent soil should be well\r\nshaken from them, and all foreign particles, such as stones, dirt,\r\nroots and parts of other plants, should be removed. If the roots\r\ncan not be sufficiently cleared of soil by shaking, they should be\r\nthoroughly washed in clean water. It does not pay to be careless in\r\nthis matter. The presence of soil increases the weight of the roots,\r\nbut the intending purchaser is not willing to pay for the weight of\r\nthe dirt, and grades the uncleaned drug accordingly. It is the clean,\r\nbright-looking root that will bring a good price.\r\n\r\nAfter washing, the roots should be carefully dried. This can best be\r\naccomplished by exposing them to light and air (not direct sunlight) on\r\nracks or shelves, or on clean, well-ventilated barn floors or lofts.\r\nThey should be spread out thinly and turned occasionally from day to\r\nday until completely cured. When this point is reached, in perhaps\r\nthree to six weeks, the roots will snap readily when bent. During the\r\ncuring process the roots, if dried out of doors, should be placed under\r\nshelter at night and upon the approach of rainy weather.\r\n\r\nWith some roots additional preparation is required, such as slicing and\r\nthe removal of fibrous rootlets. Wherever this is necessary mention\r\nwill be made of it under the descriptions of the different plants. In\r\ngeneral, it may be said that large roots should always be split or\r\nsliced when green in order to facilitate drying.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 BARKS.\r\n\r\nThe plants considered in this bulletin do not furnish medicinal barks,\r\nbut inasmuch as there are certain sections of the country where trees\r\nfurnishing such barks are rather abundant, directions for their\r\ncollection may not be out of place here.\r\n\r\nBarks of trees should be gathered in spring, when the sap begins to\r\nflow, but may also be peeled in winter. In the case of the coarser\r\nbarks (as elm, hemlock, poplar, oak, pine, and wild cherry) the outer\r\nlayer is shaved off before the bark is removed from the tree, which\r\nprocess is known as “rossing.” Only the inner bark of these trees is\r\nused medicinally. Barks may also be cured by exposure to sunlight.\r\nMoisture must be avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           LEAVES AND HERBS.\r\n\r\nLeaves and herbs should be collected when the plants are in full\r\nflower. It is very desirable that they retain their bright green color\r\nafter curing, and this can be done by careful drying in the shade. In\r\nthe collection of leaves the whole plant may be cut and the leaves\r\nmay be stripped from it, rejecting the stems as much as possible. In\r\nthe case of herbs the coarse and large stems should be rejected and\r\nonly the flowering tops and more tender stems and leaves included. All\r\ngrasses, bits of other plants, and other foreign substances should be\r\ncarefully removed, as well as dead, shriveled, diseased, and discolored\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\nBoth leaves and herbs should be spread out in thin layers on clean\r\nfloors, racks or shelves, in the shade but where there is free\r\ncirculation of air, and turned frequently until thoroughly dry.\r\nMoisture will darken them. The same precautions that are necessary in\r\ncuring roots apply here also, so far as placing them under cover to\r\navoid dew or rain is concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                FLOWERS.\r\n\r\nFlowers are collected when they first open or immediately after—not\r\nwhen they are beginning to fade. To preserve the bright natural color\r\nas nearly as possible they should be carefully dried in the shade, in\r\nthe same manner as directed for leaves and herbs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 SEEDS.\r\n\r\nSeeds should be gathered just as they are ripening, before the seed\r\npods open, and should be winnowed in order to remove fragments of\r\nstems, leaves, and shriveled specimens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         DISPOSAL OF THE DRUGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSamples representative of the lot of drugs to be sold should be sent\r\nto the nearest commission merchant, general store, or drug store,\r\nfor inspection and for quotation on the amount of drug that can be\r\nfurnished, or for information as to where to send the article. The\r\nsize of the sample depends, of course, upon the kind of drug; from\r\n3 to 4 ounces—or, say, at least a good handful—should be submitted.\r\nThe package containing the sample should be plainly marked as regards\r\ncontents, and the name and address of the sender given. In writing to\r\nthe different dealers for information and prices, it should be stated\r\nhow large a quantity of a particular drug can be furnished and how\r\nsoon this can be supplied, and postage should always be inclosed for\r\nreply. In no case should the entire lot of collected drugs be sent to\r\ndealers without preliminary correspondence. The collector should bear\r\nin mind that freight is an important item, and it is best, therefore,\r\nto address such dealers as are nearest to the place of production. When\r\nready for shipment, crude drugs may be tightly packed in burlap or\r\ngunny sacks, or in dry, clean barrels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        DESCRIPTIONS OF PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plants included in this bulletin are burdock, dandelion, the docks,\r\ncouch grass, and pokeweed (principally root drugs); foxglove, mullein,\r\nlobelia, tansy, gum plant, scaly grindelia, boneset, catnip, hoarhound,\r\nyarrow, fleabane, blessed thistle, jimson weed, and poison hemlock (of\r\nwhich either the leaves, flowers, herb, or seeds are used in medicine);\r\nand also wormseed, and black and white mustards, of which the seeds\r\nonly are used.\r\n\r\nDescriptions of these plants follow, together with the common names\r\nby which they are known in different localities, the habitat (or, in\r\nother words, the kinds of places or soils in which they are likely to\r\nbe found), their geographical range, information as to the parts to be\r\ncollected, their uses, the extent to which they are imported and the\r\nprices usually paid by dealers.\r\n\r\nThe principal uses for which these plants are employed in medicine are\r\nbriefly indicated, but none of the drugs mentioned should be taken\r\nwithout the advice of a physician.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the figures for dandelion and mustard, which were\r\nobtained from the Bureau of Statistics of the Department of Commerce\r\nand Labor, the imports are based on estimates furnished by dealers,\r\nand the prices per pound, while serving to give an idea as to what\r\nmay be expected for the drugs, will vary from year to year, depending\r\nprincipally upon supply and demand.\r\n\r\nThere are of course a large number of plants used in medicine that are\r\nnot included in this bulletin, which is intended to cover only such\r\nmedicinal plants as may be classed as weeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BURDOCK.\r\n                           _Arctium lappa_ L.\r\n\r\n=Other common names.=—Cockle button, cuckold dock, beggars’ buttons,\r\nhurr-bur, stick button, hardock, and bardane. (Fig. 1.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.—Burdock (_Arctium lappa_ L.). Flowering plant.]\r\n\r\n=Habitat and range.=—Burdock is one of the most common weeds. It was\r\nintroduced from the Old World, and is common and often very abundant in\r\nthe Eastern and Central States and in some scattered localities in the\r\nWest, growing along roadsides, in fields, pastures, and waste places.\r\n\r\n=Description.=—This is a coarse, unsightly biennial weed of the aster\r\nfamily (Asteraceæ), which produces during the first year of its growth\r\nonly a rosette of large, thin leaves (fig. 2) and a long, tapering\r\nroot having a diameter of from one-half to 1 inch. When full grown it\r\nmeasures from 3 to 7 feet high. The round, fleshy stem is branched,\r\ngrooved, and hairy, with very large leaves, even in the early stages\r\nof the growth of the plant, the lower leaves often measuring 18 inches\r\nin length. The leaves are alternate, on long, solid, deeply furrowed\r\nleafstalks; thin, roundish or oval, but usually heart-shaped; with\r\neven, wavy, or toothed margins; smooth above, and pale and woolly on\r\nthe under surface. The flowers are purple, in small, clustered heads,\r\nappearing in the second year, from July to frost. These flower heads\r\nare armed with hooked tips, and the burs thus formed are a great pest,\r\nattaching themselves to clothing and to the wool and hair of animals.\r\nThe seed of burdock is produced in great abundance, one plant bearing\r\nas many as 400,000 seeds.\r\n\r\n=Parts used.=—The root alone is recognized in the United States\r\nPharmacopœia, but there is a limited demand for burdock seed, and the\r\nleaves also are employed. Burdock roots and seeds are used in blood\r\nand skin diseases, and the leaves externally as a cooling poultice for\r\nswellings and ulcers, the latter being employed only in the fresh state.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.—Burdock. First year’s growth.]\r\n\r\nBurdock has a large taproot, about 12 inches long, fleshy, the outside\r\nblackish-brown or grayish-brown, the inside light in color and spongy\r\nin the center. It is to be collected in the fall of the first year. The\r\nroots must be washed, split lengthwise, and carefully dried. Drying\r\ncauses the root to lose about four-fifths of its weight, and to become\r\nscaly, and wrinkled lengthwise. Sometimes the bases of the leafstalks\r\nremain at the top of the root in the form of a small, white, silky\r\ntuft. The odor of the root is weak and unpleasant.\r\n\r\nThe seeds are oblong, curved, flattened, and angular, dark brown\r\nand sometimes spotted with black, and have no odor. These should be\r\ncollected when ripe or nearly so.\r\n\r\n=Imports and prices.=—About 50,000 pounds of lappa or burdock root are\r\nimported annually, and the best root is said to come from Belgium,\r\nwhere great care is exercised in its collection.\r\n\r\nThe price of the root ranges from 3 to 8 cents per pound, and that of\r\nthe seed from 5 to 10 cents.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               DANDELION.\r\n   _Taraxacum taraxacum_ (L.) Karst. (_Taraxacum officinale_ Weber.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.—Dandelion (_Taraxacum taraxacum_ (L.) Karst).\r\n(An unusually fibrous root.)]\r\n\r\n=Other common names.=—Blow-ball, cankerwort, doon-head-clock,\r\nfortune-teller, horse gowan, Irish daisy, yellow gowan, one o’clock.\r\n(Fig. 3.)\r\n\r\n=Range and habitat.=—Dandelion is distributed as a weed in all\r\ncivilized parts of the world, and in this country is naturalized from\r\nEurope. With the exception of the South, it is very abundant throughout\r\nthe United States in fields and waste places, and it is especially\r\ntroublesome in lawns and meadows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.—Dandelion root, 16 inches long.]\r\n\r\n=Description.=—The dandelion is so well known a weed, especially in\r\nlawns, that it scarcely requires a description, almost everyone being\r\nfamiliar with its rosette of coarsely toothed leaves, golden-yellow\r\nflowers, and round fluffy seed heads. It is a perennial plant of the\r\nchicory family (Cichoriaceæ), and it may be said to be in flower\r\nthroughout almost the entire year. In spring the young leaves are\r\ncollected and used for greens or salad, but the part employed in\r\nmedicine is the root. The flowering stem of the dandelion is usually\r\nlonger than the smooth, shining green, coarsely toothed leaves,\r\nreaching a height of from 5 to 10 inches. It is erect, smooth, naked,\r\nand hollow, bearing at the summit a solitary yellow flower head,\r\nwhich opens in the morning and only in fair weather. The entire plant\r\ncontains a white, milky juice.\r\n\r\n=Part used.=—As already stated, the root of dandelion is used\r\nmedicinally. It is a large taproot, sometimes 20 inches long, thick\r\nand fleshy, dull-yellow or brownish on the outside, white inside,\r\npractically without odor, and bitter. (Fig. 4.) Dandelion is often used\r\nas a tonic in diseases of the liver and in dyspepsia.\r\n\r\nThe best time for digging dandelion root is from July to September,\r\nduring which time the milky juice becomes thicker and the bitterness\r\nincreases. It should be carefully washed and thoroughly dried.\r\nDandelion roots decrease considerably in size by drying, weighing less\r\nthan half as much as the fresh roots and becoming wrinkled lengthwise.\r\nThe dried root should not be kept too long, as drying diminishes its\r\nmedicinal virtues.\r\n\r\n=Imports and prices.=—During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1903, the\r\nimports of taraxacum or dandelion root into the United States amounted\r\nto 115,522 pounds. The price per pound ranges from 4 to 6 cents.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 DOCKS.\r\n                            _Rumex_ species.\r\n\r\nSeveral species of docks possess medicinal properties. Among these\r\nare the yellow dock (_Rumex crispus_ L.), the broad-leaved dock (_R.\r\nobtusifolius_ L.), and the yellow-rooted water dock (_R. britannica_\r\nL.), all more or less abundant throughout the United States. Other\r\nspecies are also recognized as possessing value in medicine, but those\r\nabove mentioned are the kinds generally collected.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Yellow Dock.\r\n                           _Rumex crispus_ L.\r\n\r\n=Other common names.=—Curled dock, narrow dock, sour dock. (Fig. 5.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.—Yellow dock (_Rumex crispus_ L.). First year’s\r\ngrowth.]\r\n\r\n=Range and habitat.=—The species most commonly employed in medicine\r\nis the yellow dock, a perennial introduced from Europe and now found\r\nthroughout the United States as a troublesome and very persistent weed\r\nin cultivated as well as waste ground, among rubbish heaps, and along\r\nroadsides.\r\n\r\n=Description.=—The deep, spindle-shaped root sends up an erect,\r\nangular, and furrowed stem about 2 to 4 feet high, leafy, branching\r\nnear the top, and bearing numerous elongated clusters of inconspicuous\r\nflowers. The leaves are lance-shaped, acute, with the margins strongly\r\nwaved and crisped. The lower leaves are obtuse or heart shaped at the\r\nbase, from 6 to 8 inches in length, and are borne on long stalks, while\r\nthose nearer the top are narrower and shorter, being only 3 to 6 inches\r\nlong, on short stems or stemless.\r\n\r\nFrom June to August the yellow dock puts forth, interspersed with\r\nleaves, its many long dense clusters of green, drooping groups of\r\ninconspicuous flowers placed in circles around the stem.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Broad-leaved Dock.\r\n                        _Rumex obtusifolius_ L.\r\n\r\n=Other common names.=—Bitter dock, common dock, blunt-leaved dock,\r\nbutter dock. (Fig. 6.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.—Broad-leaved dock (_Rumex obtusifolius_ L.).\r\nFirst year’s growth.]\r\n\r\n=Range and habitat.=—The range of this very common weed extends from\r\nthe New England States to Oregon and south to Florida and Texas; it\r\noccurs in waste places.\r\n\r\n=Description.=—Broad-leaved dock differs from the yellow dock\r\nprincipally in its more robust habit of growth. It grows to about the\r\nsame height, but its stem is stouter, and the leaves, which are wavy\r\nalong the margin as in the yellow dock, are much broader and longer.\r\nThe lower leaves have long stalks, and are from 6 to 14 inches in\r\nlength, with heart-shaped or roundish bases, while the upper ones are\r\nfrom 2 to 6 inches long and are on short stalks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.—Leaf, fruiting spike, and root of broad-leaved\r\ndock.]\r\n\r\nThe green flowers appear from June to August, and are in rather long,\r\nopen clusters, the groups rather loose and far apart. In all of the\r\ndocks here mentioned, the three inner divisions of the calyx (outer\r\ncovering of flower) in fruiting form a kind of triangular nut, like the\r\ngrain of buckwheat (to which family, Polygonaceæ, the docks belong),\r\nand one or more of these divisions bear on the back a small granule.\r\nThe difference between flower and fruit is barely distinguishable when\r\nseen from a little distance so long as the fruit is immature, both\r\nbeing green, but later in the season, as the fruit ripens, the spikes\r\ntake on a rusty-brown color. (Fig. 7.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Yellow-rooted Water Dock.\r\n                         _Rumex britannica_ L.\r\n\r\n=Habitat and range.=—As the common name indicates, this plant frequents\r\nswampy and wet places and banks of streams. It is found from Canada to\r\nNew Jersey and Pennsylvania, and westward to Minnesota, Illinois, and\r\nIowa.\r\n\r\n=Description.=—The yellow-rooted water dock is a taller plant than\r\neither of the docks previously mentioned, its stout stem sometimes\r\nreaching a height of 6 feet. The leaves at the base of the plant are\r\nborne on long stalks, and are from 1 to 2 feet in length, but, as with\r\nthe other two species, the leaves toward the top of the plant are\r\nshorter, as are also the stalks supporting them. The densely flowered\r\nclusters are not as leafy as in the preceding species mentioned. The\r\nplant flowers from July to August.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.—Yellow dock root.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Dock Roots.\r\n\r\nThe root, which is the part to be collected for medicinal purposes, is\r\nvery similar in all of these species of dock (figs. 7 and 8), usually\r\nfrom 8 to 12 inches long, fleshy, often somewhat branched, the outside\r\ndark reddish-brown with a rather thick bark, internally yellowish. It\r\npossesses but a very faint odor and a bitter, astringent taste. The\r\nroots should be collected in late summer or autumn after the fruiting\r\ntops have ripened, then washed, split lengthwise into halves or\r\nquarters, and carefully dried.\r\n\r\nThe docks are largely employed for purifying the blood and as a remedy\r\nin skin diseases.\r\n\r\n=Imports and prices.=—Rumex or dock roots are imported into this\r\ncountry to the extent of about 125,000 pounds annually. The price\r\nranges from 2 to 8 cents per pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COUCH GRASS.\r\n         _Agropyron repens_ (L.) Beauv. (_Triticum repens_ L.)\r\n\r\n=Other common names.=—Dog-grass, quick-grass, quack-grass,\r\nquitch-grass, scutch-grass, twitch-grass, witch-grass, wheat-grass,\r\nChandler’s grass, creeping wheat-grass, devil’s-grass, durfa-grass,\r\nDurfee-grass, Dutch-grass, Fin’s grass, quake-grass. (Fig. 9.)\r\n\r\n=Range and habitat.=—Couch grass, like so many other pernicious\r\nweeds, was introduced into this country from Europe, and is now a\r\nmost troublesome pest in cultivated ground, causing the farmer a\r\nloss of thousands of dollars annually by taking possession of fields\r\nand crowding out valuable crops. It is most abundant from Maine to\r\nMaryland, and westward to Minnesota and Missouri, but is rather\r\nsparingly distributed in the South. It is gaining ground on farms on\r\nthe Pacific slope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.—Couch grass (_Agropyron repens_ (L.) Beauv.).]\r\n\r\n=Description.=—This rather coarse grass produces several stems, 1\r\nto 3 feet high, from a long, creeping, jointed rootstock, and bears\r\ndensely flowered spike-like heads resembling those of rye or beardless\r\nwheat. The stems are round, smooth, thickened at the joints, and\r\nhollow, bearing from five to seven leaves. These have a long cleft\r\nsheath, and are rough on the upper surface. The heads or spikes are\r\nterminal, solitary, compressed, with two rows of spikelets on a wavy\r\nand flattened axis.\r\n\r\nCouch grass is one of the most difficult weeds to eradicate, on\r\naccount of the long jointed rootstock, each joint of which is capable\r\nof producing a new plant. Every bit of the rootstock must therefore be\r\nremoved from the soil or killed in order to eradicate it.\r\n\r\n=Part used.=—The most important part of this grass, not only\r\nagriculturally but also pharmaceutically, is its long, tough rhizome or\r\nrootstock, creeping along underneath the ground and pushing in every\r\ndirection. It is pale yellow, smooth, about one-eighth of an inch in\r\ndiameter, with joints at intervals of about an inch from which slender\r\nbranching rootlets are produced.\r\n\r\nOne of the best methods of destroying this weed is to plow up the roots\r\nand burn them. They need not be burned, however, but may be saved and\r\nprepared for the drug market. After the rootstocks have been collected\r\nand washed the rootlets should be removed and the rhizome or rootstock\r\n(not the rootlets) cut into short pieces about two-fifths of an inch\r\nlong. An ordinary feed-cutting machine may be used for this purpose.\r\nThese should then be dried as suggested in the general instructions.\r\n\r\nIn the drug trade this plant is generally known as dog grass or\r\ntriticum. As found in the stores, it is in the form of small, angular\r\npieces, about one-eighth to one-fourth of an inch long, straw colored,\r\nshining, and hollow. These pieces are odorless but have a somewhat\r\nsweetish taste.\r\n\r\nThe fluid extract prepared from dog grass is used in kidney and bladder\r\ntroubles.\r\n\r\n=Imports and prices.=—Couch grass is almost wholly an imported article,\r\nsome 250,000 pounds coming into this country annually from Europe. The\r\nprice is about 3 to 7 cents per pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               POKEWEED.\r\n          _Phytolacca americana_ L. (_Phytolacca decandra_ L.)\r\n\r\n=Other common names.=—Poke, pigeon-berry, garget, scoke, pocan, coakum,\r\nVirginian poke, ink-berry, red-ink-berry, American nightshade, cancer\r\njalap, redweed. (Fig. 10.)\r\n\r\n=Range and habitat.=—Pokeweed is common in rich, moist soil along fence\r\nrows, margins of fields, and in uncultivated land from the New England\r\nStates to Minnesota and south to Florida and Texas. It is native in\r\nthis country and naturalized in Europe, where it is regarded as an\r\nornamental garden plant.\r\n\r\n=Description.=—The reddish purple stems, rich green foliage, and\r\nclusters of white flowers and dark-purple berries give to this plant a\r\nrather handsome appearance. Pokeweed attains a height of from 3 to 9\r\nfeet from a very large perennial root. It is erect, branched, the stems\r\nstout, smooth, green at first, then reddish. On examining a piece of\r\nthe stem, the pith will be seen to be divided into disk-shaped pieces,\r\nwith hollow spaces between them. The leaves are ovate or ovate-oblong,\r\nacute at the apex, smooth, about 5 inches long and 2 to 3 inches wide,\r\non short stems. The margins are without indentation. About July to\r\nSeptember the long clusters of whitish flowers are produced, followed\r\nby the green berries, which upon ripening become a rich dark-purple\r\ncolor. The flower clusters are from 3 to 4 inches in length and on long\r\nstalks, the flowers numerous and borne on reddish stems. The berries\r\nare globular, flattened both at top and bottom, smooth and shining, and\r\ncontain ten black seeds imbedded in a rich crimson juice. (Fig. 11.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.—Pokeweed (_Phytolacca americana_ L.).]\r\n\r\n=Parts used.=—For medicinal purposes the berries and roots are\r\nemployed. Both of these should be collected when the berries are fully\r\nmature, which usually occurs about two months after flowering. The\r\nclusters of berries should be carefully dried in the shade. They are\r\npoisonous, have no odor, a sweetish taste at first, then acrid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.—Pokeweed, flowering and fruiting branch.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.—Pokeroot.]\r\n\r\nPokeweed has a very large, fleshy, and poisonous root, conical in shape\r\nand branched. (Fig. 12.) It should be gathered in the latter part of\r\nthe fall, thoroughly cleaned, cut into transverse slices, and carefully\r\ndried. When dry it has a grayish, wrinkled appearance, breaks with a\r\nfibrous fracture, and the slices show many concentric rings. There is a\r\nslight odor and the taste is sweetish and acrid.\r\n\r\nBoth the berries and roots are alterative, act upon the bowels and\r\ncause vomiting, and preparations made from them are used in treating\r\nvarious diseases of the skin and blood, and in certain cases in\r\nrelieving pain and allaying inflammation.\r\n\r\n=Price.=—Phytolacca or pokeroot brings from 2 to 5 cents per pound, and\r\nthe dry berries about 5 cents per pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FOXGLOVE.\r\n                        _Digitalis purpurea_ L.\r\n\r\n=Other common names.=—Purple foxglove, thimbles, fairy cap, fairy\r\nfingers, fairy thimbles, fairy bells, dog’s finger, finger flower,\r\nlady’s glove, ladyfingers, lady’s thimble, popdock, flapdock, flopdock,\r\nlion’s mouth, rabbit’s flower, cottagers, throatwort, Scotch mercury.\r\n(Fig. 13.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.—Foxglove (_Digitalis purpurea_ L.).]\r\n\r\n=Range and habitat.=—Foxglove was originally introduced into this\r\ncountry from Europe as an ornamental garden plant, but has now escaped\r\nfrom cultivation in a few localities and is assuming the character\r\nof a weed. This is the case in parts of Oregon, Washington, and West\r\nVirginia, where the plant is found in great abundance in dry, sandy\r\nsoil, along roads and fence rows, on the borders of timber land, and in\r\nsmall cleared places.\r\n\r\n=Description.=—This is a very handsome plant of the figwort family\r\n(Scrophulariaceæ), biennial, and the first year forms only a rosette\r\nof dense leaves, but in the second year of its growth the simple erect\r\nflowering stalk is produced, attaining a height of from 3 to 4 feet.\r\nThis is round, indistinctly angled toward the top, leafy and downy. The\r\nleaves are oblong-ovate, narrowed at the base into long winged stalks;\r\nthe upper surface of the leaves is dull-green and wrinkled, while the\r\nunder side is grayish, with short, soft hairs and a thick network of\r\nprominent veins. The root leaves are rather large and are borne on long\r\nstalks, but as the leaves approach the top of the plant they become\r\nsmaller and the leafstalks shorter.\r\n\r\nThe plant is in flower about June, and the long clusters of numerous\r\ntubular bell-shaped flowers are very showy. The clusters are terminal,\r\nand about 14 inches in length. The flowers are large, about 2 inches\r\nlong, the color ranging from white through lavender to purple, the\r\ninside of the lower lobe bearing long, soft, white hairs and crimson\r\nspots on a white ground.\r\n\r\n=Part used.=—Leaves of the second year’s growth only are employed, and\r\nthese should be collected when about two-thirds of the flowers have\r\nexpanded. They should be very carefully dried in the shade and then\r\nkept in closed boxes or barrels so as to keep out all moisture. The\r\ngreatest care is necessary in curing, as the leaves soon lose their\r\nmedicinal properties if not properly dried.\r\n\r\nPreparations made from foxglove are of great value in heart troubles,\r\nbut they are poisonous and should never be used except on the advice of\r\na physician.\r\n\r\n=Imports and prices.=—From 40,000 to 60,000 pounds of digitalis or\r\nfoxglove are annually imported into this country from Europe, where the\r\nplant is cultivated. The American-grown product has so far never been\r\nused, but leaves from the wild American plant have been assayed and\r\nfound to be equally as good as the European article.\r\n\r\nThe price per pound ranges from about 6 to 8 cents.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                MULLEIN.\r\n                         _Verbascum thapsus_ L.\r\n\r\n=Other common names.=—Great mullein, velvet or mullein dock, Aaron’s\r\nrod, Adam’s flannel, blanket leaf, bullock’s lungwort, cow’s or clown’s\r\nlungwort, candlewick, feltwort, flannel leaf, old-man’s flannel, hare’s\r\nbeard, hedge taper, ice leaf, Jacob’s staff, Jupiter’s staff, lady’s\r\nfoxglove, Peter’s staff, shepherd’s club, torches, torchwort, velvet\r\nplant. (Fig. 14.)\r\n\r\n=Range and habitat.=—Mullein is a native of Europe, and occurs in this\r\ncountry as a troublesome weed in fields and pastures, waste places,\r\nand along roadsides from Maine to Minnesota and southward, and it is\r\nalso spreading in the far Western States. It produces great quantities\r\nof seed, and, if allowed to persist, will soon stock the ground with\r\nseeds which may retain their vitality and germinate at intervals for a\r\nnumber of years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.—Mullein (_Verbascum thapsus_ L.).]\r\n\r\n=Description.=—Mullein can be easily recognized by its tall, erect\r\nhabit of growth, the white-woolly or felty appearance of the entire\r\nplant, and its spike of golden-yellow flowers. It is a biennial\r\nbelonging to the figwort family (Scrophulariaceæ).\r\n\r\nThis plant has a stout, straight stem, which sometimes grows as tall\r\nas 7 feet. The stem and also the leaves are densely hairy, the latter\r\nalternate, sessile (stemless), their margins extending in wings along\r\ndown the stem. The rather thick, rough leaves are from 4 to 12 inches\r\nin length, oblong, acute, and densely hairy above and below.\r\n\r\nIn the first year of its growth only a rosette of downy leaves is\r\nproduced, but during the second year the flower stalk with its densely\r\nflowered spike appears. The golden-yellow flowers are produced from\r\nJune to August.\r\n\r\n=Parts used.=—As the leaves and flowers are to be collected at the\r\ntime when the plant is in bloom, the propagation of the plant by the\r\ndissemination of its seed is prevented. The leaves are cured in the\r\nusual manner. They are practically inodorous, and have a somewhat\r\nbitter, mucilaginous taste.\r\n\r\nIt is very desirable to have the flowers retain their bright yellow\r\ncolor: they must therefore be thoroughly dried, and then kept free from\r\nmoisture in well-stoppered bottles. They readily absorb moisture and\r\nif allowed to become damp will turn black. The corolla (petals), with\r\nthe adhering stamens only, is dried, the calyx being rejected. Mullein\r\nflowers have a sweetish, pleasant odor.\r\n\r\nMullein is used in coughs and catarrh, to quiet nervous irritation,\r\nand to relieve pain and inflammation. According to some authors the\r\ndried leaves are often smoked like tobacco to relieve nasal catarrh and\r\nthroat affections.\r\n\r\n=Imports and prices.=—About 5,000 pounds of verbascum or mullein\r\nflowers are annually imported, chiefly from Germany, in which country\r\nthis plant is cultivated. The leaves are also imported to a small\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nThe price paid for the leaves ranges from 2½ to 5 cents per pound, and\r\nthat for the flowers may range from 25 to 75 cents per pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                LOBELIA.\r\n                          _Lobelia inflata_ L.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.—Lobelia (_Lobelia inflata_ L.).]\r\n\r\n=Other common names.=—Indian tobacco, wild tobacco, bladder pod, asthma\r\nweed, gagroot, pukeweed, vomitwort, low belia, eyebright. (Fig. 15.)\r\n\r\n=Range and habitat.=—This poisonous weed occurs nearly everywhere\r\nthroughout the United States, being most plentiful east of the\r\nMississippi River, and thriving in dry, clayey, or siliceous soil in\r\nsunny situations along roadsides, and in old fields and pastures.\r\n\r\n=Description.=—The erect leafy stem of this annual herbaceous plant\r\nis from 1 to 3 feet high, from a fibrous root. It is simple and\r\nrough-hairy below, smooth above, and bears a few short branches.\r\nThe entire plant contains an acrid milky juice. It belongs to the\r\nbellflower family (Campanulaceæ).\r\n\r\nThe pale-green leaves are alternate, from 1 to 2½ inches long,\r\ngradually diminishing in size as they reach the summit of the plant,\r\nthe lower leaves being borne on stalks, while the upper ones are\r\nstemless. They are thin, oblong or oval, blunt, irregularly toothed,\r\nand almost wavy, with short hairs on both surfaces.\r\n\r\nFrom July until frost the rather inconspicuous, very small pale-blue\r\nflowers appear. These are very numerous, each one borne in the axils\r\nof the upper leaves on very short stems, all together forming a long,\r\nspike-like head. The lower lip of the flower has three lobes, the upper\r\none two segments, and from the center of the latter the tube of the\r\nflower is cleft to the base. The seed pods are in the form of inflated\r\ncapsules, nearly globular, striated (grooved or marked with parallel\r\nlines), and contain very numerous minute dark-brown seeds.\r\n\r\n=Parts used.=—The leaves and flowering tops are used in medicine, and\r\nthere is also a good demand for the seed. The leaves and tops should be\r\ngathered after some of the pods have become inflated, should be dried\r\nin the shade, and when dry kept in covered vessels. The dried leaves\r\nand tops have a rather disagreeable, somewhat sickening odor, and the\r\ntaste, though mild at first, soon becomes strongly acrid and nauseous.\r\nThe seeds are extremely minute, and each capsule is said to contain\r\nfrom 450 to 500 seeds.\r\n\r\nLobelia is an expectorant, acts upon the nervous system and bowels,\r\ncauses vomiting, and is poisonous.\r\n\r\n=Price.=—The price paid for the dried leaves and tops ranges from 3 to\r\n8 cents per pound, and that for the seed from 15 to 20 cents per pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 TANSY.\r\n                         _Tanacetum vulgare_ L.\r\n\r\n=Other common names.=—Bitter buttons, ginger plant, parsley fern,\r\nscented fern. (Fig. 16.)\r\n\r\n=Range and habitat.=—Tansy was originally introduced into this country\r\nas a garden plant from Europe, where it is native. It has now escaped\r\nfrom cultivation and is found as a weed along waysides and fences\r\nin many places from New England to Minnesota and southward to North\r\nCarolina and Missouri.\r\n\r\n=Description.=—This strong-scented perennial herb belongs to the aster\r\nfamily (Asteraceæ). The stout, erect stem is from 1½ to 3 feet high,\r\nbranching near the top, somewhat reddish, and usually smooth. The\r\ngeneral outline of the leaf is oval, and it is divided nearly to the\r\nmidrib into about seven pairs of segments, which, like the terminal\r\none, are again divided for about two-thirds of the distance to the\r\nmidvein into smaller lobes having saw-toothed margins. The entire leaf\r\nis about 6 inches in length.\r\n\r\nTansy is in flower from July to September, and the roundish but\r\nflat-topped yellow flower heads are produced in dense terminal clusters.\r\n\r\n=Parts used.=—At the time of flowering the leaves and tops are\r\ncollected for medicinal purposes and are dried in the usual manner. The\r\nodor of tansy is strongly aromatic and the taste bitter. In drying,\r\ntansy loses about four-fifths of its weight.\r\n\r\nTansy is employed in derangements of women, and has stimulant and tonic\r\nproperties. It is also used for expelling worms. This drug is poisonous\r\nand has been known to produce fatal results.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.—Tansy (_Tanacetum vulgare_ L.).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.—Gum plant (_Grindelia robusta_ Nutt.).]\r\n\r\n=Imports and prices.=—About 30,000 pounds of tanacetum or tansy are\r\nimported annually. The price paid per pound ranges from 3 to 6 cents.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               GUM PLANT.\r\n                       _Grindelia robusta_ Nutt.\r\n\r\n=Range.=—The gum plant (fig. 17) occurs in the States west of the Rocky\r\nMountains.\r\n\r\n=Description.=—The entire plant is covered with a resinous substance,\r\nwhich gives it a gummy, varnished appearance, whence its common name,\r\ngum plant, is derived.\r\n\r\nThis perennial of the aster family of plants has an erect habit of\r\ngrowth, and sends up a round, smooth stem about a foot and a half\r\nhigh, narrowly grooved and freely branching near the top, each branch\r\nterminating in a large yellow flower. The branches near the flower\r\nheads have a slightly reddish appearance.\r\n\r\nThe pale-green leaves are about an inch long, of a leathery texture,\r\nrather rigid, coated with resin, and show numerous translucent dots.\r\nThe leaves are oblong-spatulate (having a gradually narrowed base below\r\nthe broader rounded summit) and are more or less clasping at the base,\r\nthe lower ones somewhat saw-toothed.\r\n\r\nThe yellow flowers are borne singly at the ends of the branches and\r\nmeasure about three-quarters of an inch across. The involucre (set\r\nof small leaves immediately beneath the flower) is very resinous and\r\nconsists of numerous thick, overlapping scales, the tips of which are\r\nrolled forward.\r\n\r\n=Parts used and prices.=—The flowering tops and leaves of this and of\r\nthe scaly grindelia are collected indiscriminately, and bring from 5 to\r\n12 cents per pound.\r\n\r\nThey are used in asthma and similar affections, and externally in cases\r\nof poisoning by poison ivy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            SCALY GRINDELIA.\r\n                  _Grindelia squarrosa_ (Pursh) Dunal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.—Scaly grindelia (_Grindelia squarrosa_ (Pursh)\r\nDunal).]\r\n\r\n=Range.=—Scaly grindelia (fig. 18) has a wider distribution than the\r\ngum plant, being quite common on the plains and prairies from the\r\nSaskatchewan to Minnesota, south to Texas and Mexico, and westward to\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\n=Description.=—This species is very similar to the gum plant, with the\r\nexception that it is smaller and does not have the gummy appearance\r\nof the former. The slender, erect stems are from 1 to 2 feet high and\r\nsomewhat sparingly branched near the top. The branches near the flower\r\nheads appear to be somewhat more reddish than in the species previously\r\nmentioned. In this species, also, the leaves are not borne on stalks,\r\nbut are somewhat clasping at the base, and they are longer (about\r\n2 inches long), not rigid, thinner, and more prominently toothed.\r\nThe flowers are also very similar to those of the gum plant, but are\r\nsmaller, the scales narrower, and the recurved tips longer and more\r\nslender.\r\n\r\n=Parts used.=—The leaves and flowering tops are collected with those of\r\nthe gum plant, _Grindelia robusta_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BONESET.\r\n                      _Eupatorium perfoliatum_ L.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.—Boneset (_Eupatorium perfoliatum_ L.).]\r\n\r\n=Other common names.=—Thoroughwort, crosswort, wood boneset, teasel,\r\nague-weed, feverwort, thorough-stem or thorough-wax, vegetable\r\nantimony, sweating plant, Indian sage, wild sage, tearal, wild Isaac.\r\n(Fig. 19.)\r\n\r\n=Range and habitat.=—Boneset delights in moist situations, and is\r\ncommon as a weed in clayey or sandy soil, in low, wet ground, and along\r\nstreams, on the edges of swamps and in thickets from the New England\r\nStates west to Nebraska and south to Texas and Florida.\r\n\r\n=Description.=—One of the features which will aid in recognizing this\r\nplant is the peculiar arrangement of the leaves. These are opposite\r\neach other and joined together at the base around the stem, and\r\ntherefore have the appearance of a single leaf with the stem passing\r\nthrough the center of it.\r\n\r\nBoneset is a perennial herb of the aster family of plants (Asteraceæ),\r\nwith stout, rough, hairy stems 1 to 5 feet high, from a horizontal,\r\ncrooked root. The leaves are opposite, united at the base, lance\r\nshaped, tapering to a point, bluntly toothed, rough with prominent\r\nveins, wrinkled, dark green on the upper surface, downy and paler green\r\non the lower surface. Both leaves together measure from 8 to 14 inches\r\nfrom point to point and 1 to 1½ inches wide. The flowers are white,\r\ntubular, ten to twenty or more united in dense heads, and the heads are\r\nborne in rather crowded flat-topped clusters, appearing from July to\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\n=Parts used.=—The leaves and flowering tops are the parts used in\r\nmedicine, and these should be collected when the plants are in\r\nflower, stripped from the stalk, and carefully dried. They lose about\r\nthree-fourths of their weight in drying. The odor is faintly aromatic,\r\nthe taste bitter and astringent.\r\n\r\nAs indicated by the common names “ague-weed” and “feverwort,” this is a\r\npopular remedy in fever and ague. It is used also in colds, dyspepsia,\r\njaundice, and for toning up the system. In large doses it is an emetic\r\nand cathartic.\r\n\r\n=Prices.=—Eupatorium or boneset leaves and tops bring from 2 to 8 cents\r\nper pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CATNIP.\r\n                          _Nepeta cataria_ L.\r\n\r\n=Other common names.=—Catmint, catrup, cat’s wort, field mint. (Fig.\r\n20.)\r\n\r\n=Range and habitat.=—This very common weed is naturalized from Europe,\r\nand is found in rather dry soil in waste places and cultivated land,\r\nabout old buildings and along fences, from Canada to Minnesota and\r\nsouthward to Virginia and Arkansas.\r\n\r\n=Description.=—The erect, square stems of this perennial herb of the\r\nmint family (Menthaceæ) grow to a height of 2 to 3 feet, are branched,\r\nand somewhat whitish in appearance from the covering of fine white\r\nhairs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.—Catnip (_Nepeta cataria_ L.)]\r\n\r\nThe leaves are opposite and borne on stems, heart shaped or oblong,\r\nwith an acute apex, 1 to 2½ inches long, evenly and finely scalloped,\r\ngreen above, beneath grayish-green with fine white hairs. The\r\nmany-flowered clusters appear from June to September, and are borne in\r\nthick spikes 1 to 5 inches long at the top of the stems and branches.\r\nThe flowers are white or somewhat purple, two-lipped, the upper lip\r\ntwo-cleft, the lower one three-lobed and sometimes spotted with red,\r\nthe middle lobe broadest and round-toothed.\r\n\r\n=Parts used.=—The flowering tops and leaves are to be collected\r\nwhen the plant is in flower and carefully dried. They have a strong\r\nmint-like odor and a bitter taste. The coarser stems and branches\r\nshould be rejected.\r\n\r\nCatnip is used in derangements of women, as a mild stimulant and tonic,\r\nand has a quieting effect on the nervous system.\r\n\r\n=Imports and prices.=—Cataria or catnip is imported in but small\r\nquantities. The price paid for the flowering tops and leaves is from 2\r\nto 8 cents per pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               HOARHOUND.\r\n                         _Marrubium vulgare_ L.\r\n\r\n=Other common names.=—Houndsbene, marvel, marrube. (Fig. 21.)\r\n\r\n=Range and habitat.=—Hoarhound has been naturalized from Europe, and\r\nhas escaped from gardens in this country, being found now rather\r\nabundantly in dry sandy or stony soil in waste places, pastures,\r\nfields, along roadsides, and near dwellings, from Maine to South\r\nCarolina, Texas, and westward to California and Oregon. It is very\r\nabundant in pastures in California, Oregon, and in limited areas in\r\nIndiana, Missouri, Ohio, and Michigan. In southern California this\r\nplant has proved a most troublesome weed, occurring almost everywhere\r\nand growing in such dense masses as to crowd out all other vegetation.\r\nIt has spread rapidly over thousands of acres, taking complete\r\npossession of the land and destroying pastures.\r\n\r\n=Description.=—The entire plant has a whitish, woolly appearance,\r\ncaused by the dense covering of hairs. It is a perennial plant, and as\r\nwill be seen from the characteristic lip-shaped flowers, is a member\r\nof the mint family (Menthaceæ). The whole plant has a rather pleasant,\r\nbalsamic odor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.—Hoarhound (_Marrubium vulgare_ L.).]\r\n\r\nHoarhound is a bushy, branching herb, with fibrous roots sending\r\nup numerous woolly stems about 1 to 3 feet high, rounded below and\r\nfour-angled above. The leaves are opposite each other, 1 to 2 inches\r\nlong, oval or nearly round, wrinkled, somewhat blunt at the apex,\r\nnarrowed or somewhat heart shaped at the base, with rounded teeth,\r\nsomewhat hairy and wrinkled on the upper surface, and prominently\r\nveined and very hoary on the lower surface. The flowers are whitish,\r\ntwo-lipped, the upper lip two-lobed, the lower three-lobed, and are\r\nborne in dense, woolly clusters in the axils of the leaves. (Fig. 22.)\r\nThe plant flowers from June to September, and the characteristic hooked\r\ncalyx teeth of the mature flower clusters cling to the wool of sheep\r\nlike a bur, resulting in the scattering of the seeds.\r\n\r\n=Parts used.=—The leaves and tops are used in medicine. These should\r\nbe gathered just before the herb is in flower, rejecting the coarse\r\nstalks, and should be dried in the shade in the usual manner. The\r\nbalsamic odor diminishes in drying. The herb has a bitter, persistent\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.—Hoarhound, flowering top.]\r\n\r\nHoarhound is well known as a remedy for colds, and is also used in\r\ndyspepsia and for expelling worms.\r\n\r\n=Imports and prices.=—A considerable quantity of marrubium or hoarhound\r\nis imported, about 125,000 pounds coming into this country annually.\r\nThree to 8 cents is the price paid per pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            BLESSED THISTLE.\r\n                         _Cnicus benedictus_ L.\r\n\r\n=Other common names.=—Holy thistle, bitter thistle, Our Lady’s thistle,\r\nSt. Benedict’s thistle, cursed thistle, spotted thistle. (Fig. 23.)\r\n\r\n=Range and habitat.=—This weed has been introduced from Europe and\r\noccurs in stony, uncultivated localities and waste places in the\r\nSouthern States and in California and Utah.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.—Blessed thistle (_Cnicus benedictus_ L.).]\r\n\r\n=Description.=—Blessed thistle is an annual plant belonging to the\r\naster family (Asteraceæ). The round stems are erect, about 1 to 2 feet\r\nhigh, branched, and rather woolly. The leaves are more or less hairy,\r\nthe lower ones borne on petioles (leaf stems), the upper ones sessile\r\n(stemless) and clasping the stem. They are oblong-lanceolate and\r\nwavy-lobed. The terminal yellow flower heads are surrounded by scales\r\nof a leathery texture, which are prolonged into long, hard, branching\r\nspines.\r\n\r\n=Parts used.=—The leaves and tops should be collected when the plant\r\nis in flower, about June, thoroughly and quickly dried, and kept in a\r\nvessel from which moisture, light, and air should be excluded. They\r\nhave a somewhat disagreeable odor and the taste is very bitter.\r\n\r\nBlessed thistle is employed in fevers, dyspepsia, and as a tonic to\r\nrestore the appetite.\r\n\r\n=Imports and prices.=—This plant is cultivated in Germany, from which\r\ncountry it is imported to a limited extent. The price per pound ranges\r\nfrom 8 to 10 cents.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                YARROW.\r\n                       _Achillea millefolium_ L.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.—Yarrow (_Achillea millefolium_ L.).]\r\n\r\n=Other common names.=—Milfoil, thousand leaf, thousand-leaved clover,\r\ngreen arrow, gordoloba, nosebleed, bloodwort, carpenter’s grass,\r\nsanguinary, soldiers’ woundwort, old man’s pepper. (Fig. 24.)\r\n\r\n=Range and habitat.=—This herb is a common weed from the New England\r\nStates to Missouri and in scattered localities in other parts of the\r\ncountry, occurring along roadsides, in old fields, pastures, and\r\nmeadows.\r\n\r\n=Description.=—Yarrow is a perennial belonging to the aster family\r\n(Asteraceæ). It is about 10 to 20 inches in height, its numerous\r\ndark-green feathery leaves divided into very fine crowded parts.\r\nThe flowers are produced in abundance from June to September. These\r\nare small, white (sometimes rose-colored), and are crowded in dense\r\nflat-topped heads.\r\n\r\nThe odor of yarrow is strong and aromatic, very similar to that of\r\nchamomile, and the taste is sharp and bitter. When this plant is eaten\r\nby cows its bitter taste and strong odor are imparted to dairy products.\r\n\r\n=Parts used.=—The entire plant is collected when in flower, and is\r\ncarefully dried. The coarser stems should be rejected. The plant loses\r\nnearly four-fifths of its weight in drying.\r\n\r\nYarrow is a stimulant tonic, acts upon the bladder, and checks\r\nexcessive discharges.\r\n\r\n=Imports and prices.=—This is an imported article, though not brought\r\ninto the United States in large quantities. The price of achillea or\r\nyarrow ranges from 2 to 5 cents per pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CANADA FLEABANE.\r\n     _Leptilon canadense_ (L.) Britton. (_Erigeron canadensis_ L.)\r\n\r\n=Other common names.=—Horseweed, colt’s tail, scabious, prideweed,\r\nbutter weed, fireweed, blood-stanch, cow’s tail, bitter weed. (Fig. 25.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.—Canada fleabane (_Leptilon canadense_ (L.)\r\nBritton).]\r\n\r\n=Range and habitat.=—This weed is common in damp, sandy soils in fields\r\nand waste places and along roadsides in many parts of the United\r\nStates, especially throughout the northern Mississippi Valley.\r\n\r\n=Description.=—Canada fleabane is an annual weed belonging to the aster\r\nfamily (Asteraceæ). The stem, which is bristly-hairy, or sometimes\r\nsmooth, varies greatly in height, according to the soil, being\r\nsometimes only 3 inches high, and in favorable soil often reaching a\r\nheight of 10 feet. The larger plants are branched near the top. The\r\nleaves are usually somewhat hairy, those scattered along the stem being\r\nrather narrow, with unbroken margins, and the lower ones slightly\r\ntoothed. From June to November numerous heads of small inconspicuous\r\nwhite flowers are produced, followed by an abundance of seed.\r\n\r\n=Parts used.=—The entire herb is medicinal, and should be gathered\r\nduring the flowering period and carefully dried. It has a faint,\r\nagreeable odor and a somewhat astringent and bitter taste. The fresh\r\nherb on distillation yields a volatile oil which is sold as oil of\r\nfleabane.\r\n\r\nThe common name “blood stanch” indicates the use of this plant for\r\narresting hemorrhages from various sources and the bleeding of wounds.\r\nIt is useful also in diarrhea and dropsy.\r\n\r\n=Price.=—The price paid for erigeron or flea bane ranges from 6 to 8\r\ncents per pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              JIMSON WEED.\r\n                         _Datura stramonium_ L.\r\n\r\n=Other common names.=—Jamestown weed (from which “jimson” weed is\r\nderived), thorn-apple, stinkweed, stinkwort, devil’s apple, mad-apple,\r\ndevil’s trumpet, fireweed, Jamestown lily, dewtry, apple of Peru. (Fig.\r\n26).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.—Jimson weed (_Datura stramonium_ L.).]\r\n\r\n=Range and habitat.=—Jimson weed is exceedingly common in fields and\r\nwaste places throughout the entire country with the exception of the\r\nNorth and West. It is native in the Tropics and widely scattered in\r\nnearly all warm countries.\r\n\r\n=Description.=—This well-known rank and ill-scented poisonous weed\r\nis an annual about 2 to 5 feet in height, and belongs to the potato\r\nfamily (Solanaceæ). Its yellowish-green stems are stout, leafy, and\r\nmuch forked. The leaves are large, 3 to 8 inches long, thin, smooth,\r\npointed at the apex and usually narrowed at the base, irregularly\r\nwaved and toothed, veiny, dark green on the upper surface and paler\r\ngreen beneath. The rather large, showy flowers are produced from May\r\nto September. They are white, funnel shaped, about 3 inches long, and\r\nhave a heavy odor. The seed pod is a dry, oval, prickly capsule, which,\r\nwhen quite ripe, bursts open and discloses four valves, containing\r\nnumerous black, kidney-shaped seeds. (Fig. 27.) The seeds are\r\nill-smelling when fresh, as is the entire plant. They are dull black,\r\nabout one-sixth of an inch long, flattened, wrinkled, and marked with\r\nsmall depressions.\r\n\r\n=Parts used.=—Both the leaves and seeds are medicinal. The leaves\r\nare collected at the time of flowering, the entire plant being cut\r\nor pulled up and the leaves stripped and dried in the shade. The\r\nunpleasant narcotic odor diminishes upon drying. The leaves are\r\npoisonous, cause dilation of the pupil of the eye, and are used\r\nprincipally in asthma.\r\n\r\nFor the collection of the seeds the capsules should be taken from\r\nthe plants when they are quite ripe, but still of a green color. The\r\ncapsules should then be dried for a few days, when they will burst open\r\nand the seeds can be readily shaken out. These should now be carefully\r\ndried. The seeds like the leaves are poisonous and possess the same\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\nOccasional cases of poisoning of children occur from eating the seeds\r\nof jimson weed and taking the flowers in their mouths.\r\n\r\n=Imports and prices.=—From 100,000 to 150,000 pounds of stramonium\r\nleaves (the name by which they are designated in the drug trade) are\r\nimported into this country annually, and about 10,000 pounds of seeds\r\nare imported.\r\n\r\nThe leaves will bring from 2½ to 8 cents per pound, and stramonium\r\nseeds from 3 to 7 cents per pound.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.—Leaves, flower, and capsules of jimson weed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Purple thorn-apple.\r\n\r\nThe purple thorn-apple, technically known as _Datura tatula_, is very\r\nsimilar to the jimson weed, possesses the same properties, and is\r\ndistinguished from it merely by its reddish stems and purplish flowers.\r\nThe leaves and seeds may be gathered with those of the jimson weed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            POISON HEMLOCK.\r\n                         _Conium maculatum_ L.\r\n\r\n=Other common names.=—Spotted parsley, St. Bennet’s herb, bad-man’s\r\noatmeal, heck-how, wode whistle, cashes, bunk, poison parsley, spotted\r\ncowbane. (Fig. 28.)\r\n\r\n=Range and habitat.=—Poison hemlock is rather common in waste places\r\nand along roadsides, principally in the Eastern and Middle States. It\r\nhas been naturalized in this country from Europe.\r\n\r\n=Description.=—From the close resemblance of the leaves of this plant\r\nto parsley, it is sometimes mistaken for the latter and fatal cases\r\nof poisoning have occurred. All parts of the plant are exceedingly\r\npoisonous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.—Poison hemlock (_Conium maculatum_ L.).]\r\n\r\nPoison hemlock belongs to the same family as the parsley, namely, the\r\nApiaceæ. It is a biennial, about 2 to 6 feet in height, with a smooth,\r\nhollow stem dotted with purple, and large leaves very much like those\r\nof parsley. The numerous small white flowers are borne in rather showy\r\numbels (flat-topped clusters, with stems from one point) and appear\r\nin June and July. The fruit ripens in August and September. The fruit\r\nis grayish-green, ribbed, about one-eighth of an inch long, ovate,\r\nlaterally flattened, and smooth.\r\n\r\nThe entire plant possesses a disagreeable mousy odor, which is\r\nespecially noticeable when bruised.\r\n\r\n=Parts used.=—The fruit and leaves are the parts used. The fruit should\r\nbe collected while still green but full grown, which in most localities\r\nis some time in August. It should be dried in dark but well ventilated\r\nplaces, and then stored in tight cans or boxes where it will not be\r\nexposed to the action of light and air.\r\n\r\nThe poison hemlock leaves should be collected when the plant is in\r\nflower, which will be in the second year of its growth. The stems\r\nshould be rejected. Contrary to the usual method of drying leaves and\r\nherbs, the poison hemlock leaves may be quickly dried in the sun and\r\nthen kept in tightly closed vessels. The leaves will retain their green\r\ncolor if properly cured. The odor is still very disagreeable, but not\r\nso pronounced as in the fresh plant.\r\n\r\nThis very poisonous drug is used in rheumatism, neuralgia, asthma, and\r\nin cases where the nervous system is in an excited condition.\r\n\r\n=Imports and prices.=—The imports of conium or poison hemlock seed\r\namount to about 20,000 pounds annually, and from 10,000 to 20,000\r\npounds of the leaves are imported. The price paid for the seed is about\r\n3 cents per pound, and for the leaves about 4 cents.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           AMERICAN WORMSEED.\r\n                     _Chenopodium ambrosioides_ L.\r\n\r\n=Other common names.=—Mexican tea, Spanish tea, Jerusalem tea, Jesuit\r\ntea, ambrosia. (Fig. 29.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.—American wormseed (_Chenopodium ambrosioides_\r\nL.).]\r\n\r\n=Range and habitat.=—This strong-scented herb, naturalized in this\r\ncountry from tropical America, frequents waste places around dwellings\r\nand is found in streets, meadows, pastures, and grain fields from New\r\nEngland to Florida, and westward to California.\r\n\r\n=Description.=—American wormseed is an annual plant of the goosefoot\r\nfamily (Chenopodiaceæ), attaining a height of from 2 to 3 feet. The\r\nstem is grooved, usually much branched and leafy, the leaves oblong or\r\noblong lance-shaped, somewhat acute at the apex, the lower ones 1 to 3\r\ninches long and wavy-toothed, the numerous upper leaves much smaller\r\nand usually entire. From July to September the flowers are produced,\r\nfollowed throughout the autumn by the fruits, both of which are green\r\nand borne in crowded leafy spikes. The whole plant has a powerful,\r\ndisagreeable odor, due to the essential oil which it contains.\r\n\r\n=Part used.=—The entire leafy part of the plant is sometimes employed\r\nfor the distillation of the oil, although the fruit alone is listed in\r\nthe Pharmacopœia of the United States. The fruit is distilled for the\r\noil, which it contains in large quantities.\r\n\r\nThe fruits are in the form of small grains, about the size of a pin\r\nhead, globular but slightly flattened, greenish, and inclosing the\r\nsmall shining black seeds. They have the same powerful odor as the\r\nplant, which does not diminish when the fruit is dried, and the taste\r\nis bitter and pungent. American wormseed is an anthelmintic, that is,\r\nit has the property of expelling worms.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of _Chenopodium anthelminticum_, another species of\r\nwormseed, are collected with those of the species just described. This\r\nplant is very similar to the American wormseed, the fruits being alike,\r\nand the only differences being that in _Chenopodium anthelminticum_\r\nthe stem is slightly taller, from 2½ to 3½ feet high, the leaves are\r\nmore coarsely toothed, the flowers are borne in more elongated, usually\r\nleafless spikes, the odor is more pronounced and disagreeable, and the\r\nrange and distribution of the plant are more limited.\r\n\r\nWormseed is cultivated to a considerable extent in parts of Maryland,\r\nwhere the distillation of the plant for the oil is carried on.\r\n\r\n=Price.=—In ordinary seasons the price paid for chenopodium or wormseed\r\nranges from 6 to 8 cents per pound. The oil distilled from wormseed is\r\nat present selling at $1.50 per pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             BLACK MUSTARD.\r\n            _Brassica nigra_ (L.) Koch. (_Sinapis nigra_ L.)\r\n\r\n=Other common names.=—Brown mustard, red mustard. (Fig. 30.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.—Black mustard (_Brassica nigra_ (L.) Koch).]\r\n\r\n=Range and habitat.=—Black mustard, introduced from Europe, is a\r\ntroublesome weed in many parts of the United States. It is common in\r\nalmost every State in the Union along roadsides, in cultivated ground,\r\nand in waste places, being especially troublesome in grain fields and\r\npastures. Both black and white mustards are cultivated in California.\r\n\r\nThis plant is a great pest in southern California, covering thousands\r\nof acres and forming dense, impenetrable thickets over 6 feet in\r\nheight, in which birds have their nesting places, and, by eating and\r\nexcreting the seeds, help to spread this pernicious weed.\r\n\r\n=Description.=—The rather stiff, dark-green, branching stem of black\r\nmustard is from 4 to 6 feet in height. The lower part of the stems and\r\nbranches is more or less bristly hairy, but the upper part is usually\r\nsmooth.\r\n\r\nThe leaves are dark green, somewhat rough, with bristly hairs, and\r\nare all borne on stalks. The lower leaves are lobed, the terminal\r\nlobe being the largest and the two or more lateral ones smaller. The\r\nleaves toward the top of the plant become lance shaped and are slightly\r\ntoothed.\r\n\r\nThe flowers of black mustard appear from June to September, and are\r\nof a bright yellow color. They are rather small, scarcely a quarter\r\nof an inch in diameter, the four petals spreading and each consisting\r\nof a rounded blade with a narrow claw. The petals alternate with the\r\npale-green sepals or calyx lobes. The flowers appear in clusters at the\r\nends of the elongating stems, followed from July to November by the\r\nnumerous erect pods crowded against the stem in dense narrow clusters.\r\nThe pods are about 1 inch in length, quadrangular, smooth, and tipped\r\nat the apex by the short, persistent style. The seeds contained in the\r\npods are very numerous, small, about one twenty-fifth of an inch in\r\ndiameter, globular, blackish brown, and finely pitted.\r\n\r\nThe plant is an annual, and if care is taken to prevent the\r\ndistribution of the seeds it is not difficult to exterminate. The seeds\r\npossess great vitality, and may remain in the ground for years before\r\ngerminating.\r\n\r\n=Collection of seeds.=—The tops may be pulled when most of the pods are\r\nnearly mature, but before they are ready to spring open. They should\r\nthen be placed on a clean, dry floor or shelf, allowing the pods to\r\nripen and dry out, when they will burst open and the seeds can be\r\nreadily shaken out.\r\n\r\nMustard seed has no odor whatever when collected, not even when it is\r\npowdered in its dry state, but as soon as water is added in grinding\r\nit, the powerful, penetrating mustard odor is developed. The taste is\r\nsharp and pungent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             WHITE MUSTARD.\r\n                           _Sinapis alba_ L.\r\n\r\n=Another common name.=—Yellow mustard. (Fig. 31.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.—White mustard (_Sinapis alba_ L.).]\r\n\r\n=Range and habitat.=—White mustard is a weed found in cultivated land\r\nalong waysides and fence rows, but is not so abundant nor so widely\r\ndistributed as the black mustard. It is naturalized in this country\r\nfrom Europe.\r\n\r\n=Description.=—This plant is very similar to black mustard, but is\r\nsmaller (growing only about 1 to 2 feet tall), bright green, but the\r\nflowers and seeds are much larger, and the rough-hairy pods with their\r\nlong, sickle-shaped beaks are spreading instead of being pressed\r\nagainst the stem. The flowers are paler yellow than those of the\r\nfore-going species. The divisions of the leaves reach to the midrib,\r\nthe leaves are rough-hairy, and the pods bristly. The seeds are pale\r\nyellow and smooth.\r\n\r\n=Collection and uses of seeds.=—The seeds are to be collected in the\r\nsame manner as those of black mustard. White mustard seed has no odor\r\nin its entire state, and when water is added in grinding it the odor\r\ndoes not become so pronounced as in the case of black mustard, neither\r\nis the taste so pungent.\r\n\r\nIn medicine mustard seeds are used principally in the preparation of\r\nplasters and poultices. They are used also in dyspepsia, and in large\r\ndoses act as an emetic.\r\n\r\n=Imports and prices.=—The imports into the United States of black and\r\nwhite mustard together during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1903,\r\namounted to 5,302,876 pounds. The price ranges from 3 to 6 cents per\r\npound for both the black and white mustard seeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          FARMERS’ BULLETINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of the Farmers’ Bulletins available for\r\ndistribution, showing the number, title, and size in pages of each.\r\nCopies will be sent to any address on application to any Senator,\r\nRepresentative, or Delegate in Congress, or to the Secretary of\r\nAgriculture, Washington, D.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks."
